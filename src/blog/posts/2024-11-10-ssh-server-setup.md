# Breathing New Life into an Old Laptop: An SSH Server for Your Home Lab

üñ•Ô∏è _That dusty ThinkPad in your closet? It's about to become your new favorite server._

Like many of you in the homelab community, I have a soft spot for old hardware.
That laptop collecting dust might seem obsolete for daily use,
but it's actually perfect for a home lab ‚Äî especially when repurposed as an SSH-accessible Linux server.

Today I'll walk you through transforming forgotten hardware into a reliable, secure SSH server.
We'll cover everything from basic setup to hardening, plus I've included a script to automate the whole process.
Whether you're just starting your homelab journey or adding another node to your existing setup, this guide has you covered.

**What you'll need:**

- An old laptop (pretty much anything from the last 10 years will work)
  - I've even done this on a Gateway from 2010 with _only_ 4 GB of RAM
- A fresh Linux installation (Ubuntu, Debian, or similar)
- 20 minutes of your time

## üöÄ Step 1: Install OpenSSH Server

First things first ‚Äî we need SSH access to the machine.
Most Linux distros ship with the SSH _client_ pre-installed, but not always the _server_ component.
Think of it this way: the client lets you connect to other machines, but the server lets other machines connect to you.

On Debian-based distros (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!\_OS, etc.):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Let's verify it's running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If you see "active (running)" in green, congratulations!
Your laptop is now listening for SSH connections on port 22.
But don't celebrate just yet ‚Äî we're about to make it much more secure.

---

## üîí Step 2: Harden Your SSH Configuration

Here's where most tutorials stop, but we're just getting started.
Default SSH configurations are functional but not secure.
We're going to fix that.

**Why change the default port?**
While security through obscurity isn't a complete solution, it dramatically reduces automated attack noise.
Bots constantly scan port 22, so moving to a custom port gives you cleaner logs and fewer intrusion attempts.

Edit the SSH server configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Update or add these lines:

```toml
Port 2222                    # Custom port (use any port 1024-65535)
PermitRootLogin no           # Root access = unnecessary risk
MaxAuthTries 3               # Limit brute-force attempts
PasswordAuthentication yes   # We'll keep this for now (see note below)
LoginGraceTime 30s           # Don't let connections hang forever
ClientAliveInterval 300      # Keep connections alive
ClientAliveCountMax 2        # But not indefinitely
```

> **Pro tip:** Planning to access this server from outside your network?
> Set `PasswordAuthentication no` and use SSH keys instead.
> It's more secure and honestly more convenient once you're used to it.

After saving your changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

Test from another machine on your network:

```bash
ssh yourusername@192.168.1.100 -p 2222
```

Replace the IP with your server's actual IP address.
If you can connect, you're golden!

## üõ°Ô∏è Step 3: Install UFW (Because Firewalls Matter)

Even if this server lives safely inside your network, defense in depth is a good habit.
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) lives up to its name ‚Äî it's iptables made simple.

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```

---

## üîß Step 4: Configure Your Firewall Like a Pro

Before enabling UFW, we'll set sensible defaults.
The last thing you want is to lock yourself out of your own server!

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

This configuration means:

- **Deny incoming**: Block all inbound connections by default
- **Allow outgoing**: Let your server make outbound connections (for updates, etc.)

Now allow SSH on your custom port:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
```

Enable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Check your handiwork:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

You should see something like:

```
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
2222/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
2222/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

Perfect! Your server is now locked down tight, with only SSH access allowed.

## üìà Level Up Your Setup (Bonus Tips)

### Set a Static IP or DHCP Reservation

Nothing's more frustrating than a server that changes IP addresses.
Either configure a static IP on the server itself,
or (better yet) set up a DHCP reservation on your router.
Your future self will thank you.

### Give Your Server a Proper Hostname

Generic hostnames are boring.
Let's fix that:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname lab-server-01
```

Make it permanent by adding it to `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
echo "127.0.1.1 lab-server-01" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Refresh your shell:

```bash
exec bash
```

### Consider SSH Key Authentication

If you're comfortable with it, SSH keys are both more secure and more convenient than passwords.
Generate a key pair, copy the public key to your server, then disable password authentication in `sshd_config`.
Your connections will be faster and more secure.

## üéØ The Big Picture

What you've just built isn't just an SSH server ‚Äî it's the foundation of your home lab infrastructure.
This little machine can now serve as:

- A development environment for testing code
- A file server using tools like Nextcloud or Samba
- A monitoring station running Prometheus or Grafana
- A jump box for accessing other network resources
- A learning platform for system administration

The beauty of repurposing old hardware is that you can experiment fearlessly.
Break something?
No problem ‚Äî you're not risking your main workstation.

## ü§ñ Automate Everything (Because We're Lazy in the Best Way)

If you're setting up multiple servers or just want to save time, here's a script that automates the entire process.
It handles SSH configuration, firewall setup, and basic hardening with customizable options.

### `setup-ssh-server.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Color codes for pretty output
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Default values
SSH_PORT=2222
HOSTNAME="lab-server"

# Parse command line arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case "$1" in
    --port)
      SSH_PORT="$2"
      shift 2
      ;;
    --hostname)
      HOSTNAME="$2"
      shift 2
      ;;
    -h|--help)
      echo "Usage: $0 [--port PORT] [--hostname HOSTNAME]"
      echo ""
      echo "Options:"
      echo "  --port     Set custom SSH port (default: 2222)"
      echo "  --hostname Set server hostname (default: lab-server)"
      echo "  -h, --help Show this help message"
      exit 0
      ;;
    *)
      echo -e "${RED}Unknown option: $1${NC}"
      echo "Use -h or --help for usage information"
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac

Customize the port and hostname:

```bash
./setup-ssh-server.sh --port 2244 --hostname webnode-01
```

The script includes colored output, error handling, and helpful next steps. Perfect for consistent deployments across multiple machines.
