module.exports = `<p>It has already been established that the Mordok were skilled imitators, but I did not realize that they could create either! When I showed Cringes-At-Light a basic BellathAh-Dien trap, something every apprentice is taught, he learned it quite rapidly. He seemed very proud of it, and the few words I learned from the aforementioned dream came in handy, confirming this. This morning, he came to me and showed me the trap that he had been working the day before. It took me a minute to realize what he had done. He had improved it, making a crude version of the next level of that kind of simple trap! I begin to realize more and more after that dream that these creatures, these people, are severely underestimated. They are not stupid. Well, most of them. If one met Stupid-Tooth, a whelp that is absolutely lacking in intelligence and only memorable by a mouth full of crooked and misshapen teeth, it would be easy to assume that the Mordok are idiotic and simple savages. (Interestingly enough, his name also appears to be the translation of the word they use to indicate Ulven, an irony that was not lost on me when I named him)</p>
<p>But one need only to meet Black Hide and Cringes-At-Light, to see that there is more to them. Even Axe is more than capable of intelligence. Somehow, this one must find a way of proving itself to Axe, without making the foolish mistake of actually challenging him. I know that Axe would gleefully murder me given the chance, no matter what Black Hide says their goddess says. When Cringes-At-Light showed me his trap, I praised him. I do not know any words in their language that convey approval like that, but I think he understood my tone. Without thinking, I patted him on the head, as one does to a child who has done well. He flinched away, whining, clearly expecting me to strike him. It would be a wonder if he had ever been touched by a kind hand in his entire, brutal life. I forced him to stay under my hand until he quieted and grew used to it. I don't think he truly understood it, but I think he enjoyed it, in some strange way.</p>`;
