module.exports = `<p>This one has discovered a sort of shrine in the depths of the Dirge Swamp. The Mordok seem to venerate certain skulls, decorated with symbols dedicated to some unknown deity. This one has retrieved the main idol for closer study, as its location was somewhat remote compared to this one's main campsite.</p>
<p>Viewing it with an eye to arcane energies, the idol veritably shines with energy. It seems to have some sort of transforming effect on the land around it Closer study, perhaps with more specialized tools, will be necessary. A trip into civilization may be necessary - this one did not expect such complexity in a simple race, and certain tools are difficult to obtain in the wilderness.</p>`
