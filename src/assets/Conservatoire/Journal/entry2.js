module.exports = `<p>Preparations continue well. A suitable village has been found near to the Dirge Swamp, an area with an especially high population of the creatures. Lodging has been obtained, and a story has been created. This one will be interested in the plants of this new land, seeking out their properties. The humans assume this one is the same as all the other Syndar; aloof, uninterested in their problems. The Ulven assume that this one is either mad or useless.</p>
<p>A cache of supplies has been made twenty chains of the path leading away from the Dirge. This one will go on periodic trips into the forests to the South, circle back into the swamp, and then make a hidden campsite. A suitable location has already been found; two days' travel in the swamp, no trails lead to it, relatively solid ground, and hidden in a hollow corpse of dead trees that seems impenetrable to first glance.</p>
<p>All caution is taken to prevent any signs of passage from being observed. This one knows the woods and forests well; there is no fear of being spotted by such primitive creatures. After this site is finished, a Mordok settlement will be located and observed.</p>`;
