module.exports = `<p>The copse has been suitably cleared. This one also thanks fortune; a Mordok site has been located only two watches distant! Initially observed for three watches, then returned to campsite to compile notes and observations.</p>
<p>The campsite appears to be a cross between a permanent settlement and a mobile campsite. A sign of possible intelligence; these are likely semi-nomadic creatures. Structures are a mix of hide tents, rough structures assembled out of rotted wood and branches, and a single canvas tent, poorly-maintained and clearly stolen. This building of structures and use of tools clearly makes the case that these creatures are more than simple beasts.</p>
<p>This one counted roughly twenty Mordok - a more careful enumeration will be required later. No children are evidenced, even though a mix of apparent males and females is evident. Interaction seems mainly violent - they seem to have no culture beyond violence. This one has been unable to find no distinction between warriors - infighting and violent displays are common, and to this one's eyes, there is no stable hierarchy to these people. Certain larger warriors seem to be leaders, but these positions change constantly.</p>`;
