module.exports = `<p>Nothing much had seemed to have happened while this one was gone. Supplies were secured, and this one took the time to further secure the alibi, though the locals did not seem to care overmuch. Best to be careful, though this one was unable to procure much proper equipment for studying the idol. This is unfortunate, but not unexpected. This one will have to make do. The Valerian tea seems to be working. My sleep has been much sounder of late.</p>
<p>This one will take time to engender a description of the idol. Its base is a small animal skull, about the size of three fists together. This one is unsure what animal it is, but the teeth suggest an herbivore of some kind. It is crowned with an arrangement of ribs that have traits that are aquatic in origin. Small glass beads are lashed in arrangement upon the skull, in no discernible pattern. Since the Mordok have not been observed to have the ability to create glass, these are likely stolen. Upon the skull are drawn symbols. They mirror each other in placement but are not the same. They are simple and tribal in appearance. They seem to look much like fangs or claws, as well as possibly some phases of the moon. One symbol has been drawn prominently upon the brow of the idol. It seems to be a stylized eye, perhaps combined with a sharp tooth, with a few dots underneath. This one will study this symbol closely, as its prominent display likely means it is of importance.</p>`
