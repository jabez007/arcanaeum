module.exports = `<p>Much to write today! The first actual encounter with one of them! This one was following Black Hide, who had wandered off alone, seemingly to collect plants for some ritual purpose. Black Hide is most assuredly a shaman of some type, which would likely explain the respect the whole tribe, even Axe, accords him. Black Hide has been observed to use spells of both schools, like the Ulven and their Witches. How the Ulven would be of end to know this! It is very fascinating and raises many perplexing and fascinating theories. Perhaps I will write them down later, once more information had been gathered. Black Hide took particular interest in a plant of some kind, and after he left this one moved in to take a closer look. It was hoped that this one could identify the plant and perhaps learn what sort of magic Black Hide commands. Black Hide had not left entirely, though, and he came back for some reason. He was as surprised as I was, which is likely why this one was not attacked on the spot. I was in shock, and I am not ashamed to admit, a little bit afraid. Words flowed from this one&rsquo;s mouth, they sounded as guttural as anything the Mordok would say. This one does not know where the words came from or what they meant, and it happened too quickly. Perhaps this one managed to remember some of their speech overheard? Black Hide was plainly shocked by this, and this one quickly drew the eye symbol in the dirt. Black Hide stared at and began to rumble something. This one did not take the time to see what would happen next and fled. Black hide did not follow this one. Perhaps if they are approached on their own terms, they will not react as violently as predicted. This one must rest and prepare and think. Perhaps I will attempt to make contact with Black Hide again if the chance presents itself.</p>`
