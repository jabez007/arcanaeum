module.exports = `<p>I spent the entirety of last night meditating and thinking about the course laid before me. Black Hide is preparing the ritual to invest me as one of the tribe and the new Alpha. Axe has not left my side since they brought back supplies and a victim for it. I can hear the creature mewling with fear even now. I had no idea what lay ahead of me when I began this course. I knew what I wanted. The Syndar are dying. We have been dying, for many generations. Foolishly we chose to ignore it, comfortable in our traditions and hubris. Now we suffer for it, now we have lost so much that may never be recovered. The humans run ever forward, paying no heed to anyone around them. The Ulven hate or fear us, and many would just as soon see us gone. I spoke with a Celestine's agent, I know how few of us remain. At the rate our children are being born we would need to gather every single Syndar, even the barbaric ferals, and do almost nothing but bear children. I did not wish to be the one to suggest to the elders that they mate with a feral, so instead, I sought a different solution. Such previous solutions and theories would only be a bandage, doing nothing really about the wound underneath. The Siphoning is still a mystery, but I believe it to be the cause of our decline.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a stream's course and flow may change over the eons, so too might the Life-Stream do so. We need to revitalize our contact with it, seek to change its course. Maybe we cannot change it back to the way it was, but the world has greatly changed as well. It is truly a new world, so perhaps a new course needs to be cut. Clearly, the Ulven and the Mordok have contact with it. They are young races, it seems, strong and vital. Ulven prosper despite the long war they fight with the Mordok, and somehow the Mordok manage to replace all the whelps and warriors they lose to the Ulven. I think I may begin to see how they have managed to keep such vitality. Perhaps the old gods have truly forsaken us. Perhaps they are dead or dying, unable to change with the change of the Life-Stream. Hmm, like the Celestines? I begin to hear a new calling, I begin to see a new path for our race. The Mordok are simple, savage, and brutal. But they have survived and flourished while we wither and die. I will find out why, and with it, I will change the course of Syndar destiny.</p>
<p>Tonight, I will sacrifice the Ulven they have brought to me. It is a tasteless affair, and one I wish was not necessary. But this one Ulven life is not as important as the fate of an entire race. I wish I could have them understand that. I even tried to explain it to it, but it would not listen. It is a shame, but it is an unavoidable one. Once I have been crowned with blood, one of their own and named their Alpha, I will take my tribe north. The Mother demands it, and I believe this is where I will get the answers needed to save my people. </p>`
