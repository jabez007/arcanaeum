module.exports = `<p>This one is prepared for the long journey ahead. A few notes will be necessary for those scholars who later read this great work, which this one hopes will someday be held as the greatest text produced for the Syndar peoples, and so this one will oblige in the practices of observation.Loathsome though it may be, the People are dying. No children are born, lives are cut short, and even the mana that serves as the force to keep the People living has dwindled away. With the plague of Undead facing the old homelands, the People have turned West, that a new home might be discovered. Many have spoken with and written of the People of the Wolf. They are simple, barbaric...and yet they live, bringing forth great numbers and thriving in this land.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the Ulven lack a limitation the the People possess; they see no distinction between the Divine and the Arcane. Though their magics are shaped only by female hands, with a few rare exceptions, their Daughters of Gaia have overcome a barrier that has vexed the Syndar for thousands of years without even knowing that it was a barrier. Many words have been expended in a vain attempt to explain this, with each theory being less helpful than the last, all in the hope that it will somehow save the People from our twilight years.</p>
<p>It is this one's opinion that they are all wrong. That they are looking at the wrong thing. It was so simple, and yet it was ignored. There are two peoples who live on this continent. Those ones who arrived first chose to observe only those they could talk to and reason with, having grown too comfortable with the politics of the world. But this one remembers the plague of undead, the creatures which cannot be reasoned with, and how the foolish humans brought them to Faedrun. These beasts slaughtered the People, and so our numbers declined. They represent a plague on the Syndar people, the root of the problem that is causing our extinction.</p>
<p>This one knows that the answer must lay with the other people of this continent, the Mordok. No scholar has yet studied them. The Ulven have rumors, but no facts, relating wild theories. There are many inconsistencies with the reports of these creatures - their numbers are greater than the lands should sustain, no children are ever seen, variable reports of intelligence. This one will observe these creatures, for it is entirely likely that they contain one of the secrets of this land.</p>
<p>For protection, this journal will be warded with the strongest magics this one can manage. Knowledge that these activities must not be known until the results are clear and the Syndar are saved is as apparent as the moon in the sky. The Ulven would burn it the moment they found it, the humans would not understand, and the fellow People would believe it foolish. But is there no reason to search for knowledge? The fate of the Syndar is at stake, and so there is no price too high.</p>`;
