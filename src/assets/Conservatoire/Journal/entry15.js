module.exports = `<p>They have granted me a little more freedom. I no longer have a constant guard, but I am not allowed to leave the encampment either. Axe and Black Hide fight constantly, though never has it again escalated to the same level as it did when they took me. It would seem that the immediate danger has passed, something this one is grateful for. It has allowed unparalleled access to studying these creatures. I believe that progress is being made in decoding their language. Help has come from an unexpected quarter. Cringes-At-Light was made my guard, surely since he was one of the lowest rankings of the veteran fighters. It is strange, but some of these creatures seem to really lack a distinct personality or real intelligence. The rest clearly think and reason, and have personalities, though in varying degrees. Size doesn't seem to have anything to do with it either. One of the unnamed Mordok, a small and unassuming female, has shown quite the personality, one that wasn't easily distinguished at a distance.</p>
<p>She seems to mock the others, one can tell from the tone of her voice if one can become accustomed to the sound of it. Somehow she manages to stop short of actually provoking a physical confrontation, something this one assumes she must lose, given the physical brawn of some of the others. This one named her appropriately, Needle-Tongue. But this one digresses. Cringes-At-Light shows a distinct curiosity that some of the others seem to lack. He watches me write, even now, and was extremely interested in the crude drawing that this one attempted. Curiously, this one has been able to establish that Mordok is indeed the word that they use for themselves. It is wondered how the Ulven ever came to know this word. Perhaps passed down from initial encounters? It is unlikely to be ever known. Cringes-At-Light will sometimes respond when I attempt to name items laying about camp. He names them for me, and I attempt to repeat it. Their language is so strange upon my tongue. Axe tolerates this, barely, like anything this one does. But the one-time Cringes-At-Light attempted to repeat words in the common tongue, Axe cuffed him soundly, and he never attempted it again.</p>`
