module.exports = `<p>Several weeks of observation to record. My hidden copse seems to serve as a suitable hiding place - despite the woodcraft of both the Ulven and the Mordok, neither seems up the skills of a true Syndar. To think that these creatures think themselves superior! Both cultures seem to be that of violence - there is little distinction between the honor duels of the Ulven and the constant fights of the Mordok, at least to this one's eyes.</p>
<p>For ease of reference, this one has begun to name the Mordok observed. An exact count has been established - twenty-three of the monsters live in this camp. This seems to conflict with other reports of these beasts - it may be that the swampy terrain lead to more permanent villages, although there is little evidence beyond this one's observations of this particular tribe. But less delay - for these notes, accuracy is important. Of the Mordok observed, the following are worthy of names in this journal.</p>
<p>Cringes-at-Light: Small, cowardly. Carries a bow, and seemed to be of low importance initially. The other Mordok treat him with disrespect, but it seems that one is more intelligent than the fellows - this one has observed it making snares and traps. Despite this value to the tribe, this Mordok tends to defer to the others.</p>
<p>Thief-of-Man: Female Mordok. Dresses in clothing seemingly stolen from human settlers - is particularly 'proud' (if such a word applies) of a noble's surcoat. Despite this pride, takes no care of garments - spattered with mud and full of rents and tears. Apparently an able warrior - has a large collection of knives. Was observed cutting the ear of of another Mordok in a fight - obviously, little gender distinction between warriors.</p>
<p>Black Hide: Odd figure. Physically weak, but is oddly respected by the other Mordok. Covers self in stolen charms, odd bits of bone, and necklaces. Seems to have a voice in arguments - many times has this one heard that one break up a particularly vicious fight. Seems to go into odd trances.</p>
<p>Piper: Somewhat unremarkable warrior. Seems to play some sort of Mordok instrument - the sound is cacophonous and sustained, like a dying animal. By these observations, it is unclear whether this is done for enjoyment or ritual. Also participates in some drumming rituals.</p>
<p>Broken Bow: Especially large Mordok. Named due to an action on the second week of observation - while preparing several arrows, that one drew on a stolen bow and had it shatter. Another Mordok laughed, whereupon that one proceeded to strangle it and beat it viciously. The other Mordok barely survived.</p>
<p>Axe: Apparent tribe leader. Taller than the others, owns a large, vicious-looking weapon. Other Mordok seem to rarely challenge that one - the leadership seems somewhat unquestioned. Occasional conflicts spring up, but all seem to be resolved fairly quickly. Seems to command the others on when they should be raiding.</p>
<p>These are the most interesting of the Mordok tribe this one has observed. All of the others seem to lack much in personality or distinguishing characteristics. Markings of the tribe seem to correspond to some unknown language or symbolism - so far, this one has been unable to determine any of the language. More detailed observations will follow.</p>`;
