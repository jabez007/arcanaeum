module.exports = `<p>The heat of the summer seems to be affecting the tribe. They do not go out much except to forage and spend the hottest parts of the day lounging or doing small work. It is no small wonder, with their black skin and layered garments that the heat affects them so. Since nothing much seems to be happening, this one will plan a trip back to civilization for some much-needed supplies.</p>
<p>This one will need more dry food supplies, it is difficult to find the time to forage for much food while observing. Flour and some oil for sure. More paper and writing utensils, perhaps a place to store them safe from the elements.</p>
<p>Must look into drawing utensils as well, though this one&rsquo;s artistic talent is meager. More medicines and first aid supplies would not go amiss, perhaps some Valerian root as this one&rsquo;s dreams have been causing troubles sleeping. Proper leather gloves for handling the idol. This one would like some better equipment for studying it, but it is unknown what the locals will have in that matter. It remains to be seen. A hooded lantern will be wanted, much writing is done in the evening, and it is best that lamplight does not carry far.</p>`;
