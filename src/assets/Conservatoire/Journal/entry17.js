<p>Black Hide shared some momentous news today. Though it took a lot of pantomimes and what little words I've managed to learn, he conveyed that the tribe was going to be moving further north. I get the feeling that this is not an arbitrary move, but has some sort of cultural or religious significance for them. There is one major problem. Black Hide and Axe got into another conflict, one that clearly concerned my presence again. Axe has grudgingly grown used to having me around, though I am very careful to stay out of his way. I do not think he wants me to go with them. To my surprise, Cringes-At-Light, Thief-of-Man, and Broken Bow came to my defense. I had managed to establish a rapport with the latter two, but I had not realized that I had impressed them enough to stand up to Axe, if only verbally. Axe did not like this, and I think he means to finally settle this once and for all. I think I am ready, finally. My dreams have been showing me what to do, and if I am to continue my studies, Axe must be put in his place. I have grown tired of cowering away from him, it is inappropriate for one such as I. I will hide away my journals again, as well as the beginning lexicon I have been building. If I am successful, and we stay in the area, I will retrieve them. If I am killed, or we move north, I will leave them, in case any of the academies come searching for me. Black Hide thinks it will either be tomorrow or the day after. Axe will not be able to stand being slighted for long.</p>
