module.exports = `<p>It is only with a tremendous misgiving that Axe is allowing me to write this. It has been three weeks since the last entry. It appears Black Hide did tell his tribe, and that they did take it seriously. This one was preparing to leave the camp and to go hide the previous journal entries. Most of my things were in my pack, which is why I have them now. Unfortunately, the journals were left behind, and it can only be hoped the weather and local animals do not destroy them. They came upon me at dawn, as mentioned before, as this one prepared to leave. I did not hear them coming. A blow to the back of my head stunned me, leaving me at their questionable mercies. This one's head was swimming, and what happened next must be taken with a grain of salt. I could see Axe approaching, and this one could only assume that death was surely coming. Black Hide stopped Axe for some reason though. A tremendous row occurred, with Black Hide and Axe screaming at each other, clearly arguing about the fate of the creature at their feet.</p>
<p>It was, and still is, the biggest confrontation witnessed between these two. This one feared it would come to blows, a fight that surely Black Hide would lose. When it did, though, Black Hide surprised me. They fought viciously, using neither magic nor weapons. They clawed and tore, snarled and yelled at each other. The other Mordok stayed well out of it, though they watched with extreme interest. Eventually, something Black Hide said must have barely convinced Axe not to immediately murder this one. Though he still had the last word. Even now, this one still feels faint surprise that this one's nose was not broken. Axe is snarling again, meaning that he is nearing the end of his tolerance for Black Hide's strange new pet. Perhaps he will allow this one to write again later.</p>`
