<p>The symbol has been observed again, this time in some of Black Hide&rsquo;s gear. The equipment in question seems to be ritualistic in one, which lends credence to the idea that it is an important one.</p>
<p>These people seem to be able to eat anything. They prefer fresh meat, but this one has observed them eating anything from rotten animals found, to leaves and bark, to the freshly trapped game, thanks to Cringes-At-Light&rsquo;s cleverness. This one is unsure why they do not seem to appreciate his talents.</p>
<p>There have been no few times a hunt was unsuccessful and it was only Cringes-At-Light&rsquo;s efforts that put meat on the menu for the tribe. Reports of cannibalism appear to be over-exaggerated, though no one has died yet in observance so this is not yet a fact.</p>
<p>Almost everything from the animal is consumed, organs included. They do not seem to discriminate between cooked and raw flesh if they have the time it appears they may actually cook. If one is particularly hungry or lazy, they will simply consume it raw, no matter the state of the meat in question.</p>`;
