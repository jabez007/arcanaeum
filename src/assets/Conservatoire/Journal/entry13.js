module.exports = '<p>This one must ashamedly admit that this one has not been watching the tribe for the last few days. The encounter with Black Hide was quite the shock. It is unsure how the tribe has reacted, for it is not doubted that Black Hide informed them of my presence. This one stands in the edge of a tremendous discovery. What can be next, but facilitate contact? This will most assuredly be the most dangerous part of this quest, a turning point that was inevitable. This one was foolish enough to deny to itself that if this line of inquiry ever reached fruition, this must happen. How will they react? It is without a doubt that if it all goes badly, this one may not die quickly. Perhaps a secret packet of belladonna, in case things do not go well. It is an ignominious end, but better than a slow and agonizing death. This one will store the previous journals, in case all does not go well. Perhaps another may extract any useful information, or if not, then it is hoped the People may know what happened to this one. If all goes well, the journals may always be recovered.</p>';
