module.exports = `<p>Full moon, colored red. This appears to be somewhat significant to the Mordok. Some sort of ritual, led by Black Hide and attended by all of the tribe - quite unusual, as there are normally several Mordok out on hunting trips or covert raids.</p>
<p>The ritual began with several of the tribe's lower-status Mordok drumming. Low, steady pattern - this one believes it is meant to emulate the heartbeat of a Mordok. The pattern appears to follow an odd triplet fashion - this may be some cue to the physiology of a Mordok. This one has been unable to kill one in order to dissect it, but it leads to an interesting theory as to their resistance to poison and other pathogens normally found in the Dirge.</p>
<p>The drumming increased steadily. Black Hide chanted continuously throughout - no progress on deciphering the language. The words seemed to follow a call-and-response pattern; Black Hide would chant, and the others would respond. Different instruments seemed to enter at a high point of the ritual - an odd clicking noise, made with dried rib bones was added, and Piper began to play - again, dissonant to this one's ears. As the intensity increased, the chanting grew more and more unified. At this stage, Axe began to loudly wail - apparently, one of the perks of being the Alpha is this portion of the ritual. At some unseen signal, all of the drummers and instruments stopped - the chanting continued, building to a feverish pitch.</p>
<p>At this stage, Black Hide took some sort of pigment from a repository in what appeared to be a bowl made from an Ulven skull. After painting all of the participants, that one proceeded to violently strike them, one by one.</p>
<p>At the last portion of the ritual, Ace and Black Hide struck one another, whereupon the chanting ceased. The Mordok, in some sort of frenzy, all left the camp at once.</p>
<p>At the rising of the sun, they returned, bloodied and bearing a pair of captive Ulven. Apparently a continuation of the previous ritual, these Ulven (a female and a child), were painted with the same pigment, elaborately dismembered, and killed. The female was killed first, and the child forced to watch the entire display - additional markings were added with the female's blood, before the child was killed.</p>
<p>The ritual seemed to follow a specific pattern (as far as it was observed first on the female, and then on the child) - first, several vertical cuts were made on the abdomen, each of which was then smeared with some sort of poison. This was apparently quite painful, as the screaming and pleas for mercy became more frantic as soon as it was applied, and served to keep the blood flowing from the wounds. Some of it was gathered, likely for later consumption or use in further rituals.</p>
<p>Next, a rather vicious knife was produced by Black Hide. Beginning with the digits on the left hand, the individuals joints were removed. For those not versed in Ulven anatomy, there are twenty-eight joints in total on both hands. The process is apparently excruciating - the child was whimpering with fright at this stage, and almost seemed to go catatonic at times before being roused by the pain of the cuts. Upon completion of the ritual, the stumps were smeared with a substance this one took to be poison and seared shut with a heated iron poker.</p>
<p>The mortification continued with the removal of large patches of skin in some sort of pattern, taken from the legs, arms, and back of the captives. This one is unaware of the significance of the patterns, but they were made with a practiced hand - likely the result of long practice or repetition of this particular ritual.</p>
<p>Finally, the incisions on the abdomen were deepened, and several internal organs were withdrawn. The captive remained alive and screaming, although the sound deepened considerably when one of the lungs was removed. These organs were then consumed by several of the participating Mordok, while others were tied to the child. At this stage, the female expired. The process was repeated, somewhat more slowly, on the child. The remains were then carefully cut apart, with certain bones (the skull, several of the long leg bones, and several ribs) being retained, while the others parts were buried in the ground.</p>
<p>This one is unable to determine the purpose of the ritual. It was a horrifying sight, and this one wishes that it were possible to have saved them. Their close watching of the entire ritual left no time for distraction, and while this one's skill in magic is considerable, there would be no chance that any living being would have made it out alive.</p>`;
