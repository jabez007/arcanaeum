module.exports = `<p>I have won. The tribe is now mine! I thought I was prepared for it, but one cannot truly be prepared for the strength and brutality of an alpha. When the time came, Axe did not mince about. His menacing bellow was the only warning I was given. His shoulder slammed me into the ground, and I began to have an inkling at how foolish it was to think I could challenge him on my own. I managed to scramble out from under him, and stared at his advancing form, wondering how I could survive this. Then my lady from my dreams came to me. She told me that this was the next step and that she would prove that I was hers. An unearthly strength flooded my limbs. It was terrifying and exhilarating, all at once. I felt that I could single-handedly destroy the entire tribe. Axe was almost as surprised as I was when I took him to the ground. I began to beat him, as mercilessly as he would have done to me. The entire time, reciting a call, in their language. I did not understand all of it, but it was their traditional call and response, one that established the dominance of a new alpha.</p>
<p>Some of the tribe joined right away, my favorite children. The rest only joined after Axe stopped moving. When he awoke, he was in pain, confused, and on the brink of an impressive bout of rage. Like with the others, I forced him to sit under my hand. It took more time than I can remember for me to finally feel him still under my hand. Once he finally looked up, waiting for me to command him, I knew that I had won. I considered killing him then. But he was just another child, one who could not hear Her voice as I could. His strength will be needed in the time to come. The Ulven will not understand, and it will take some time before the rest of the tribes will heed me. But as the Mother says, this is the way to enlightenment. This is the road I must take, the sacrifices I must make, in order to save my people.</p>`
