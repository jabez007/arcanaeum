this month clan stormjarl caused quite the uproar as they raided the lands of clan grimward there was a public outcry from the members of clan grimward that the actions clan stormjarl are cowardly as they waited until all of mardruns backs were turned to strike at their perceived foe there are voices of support among the other clans for clan grimward stating that many have put their own issues aside to deal with the mordok the enemy of all ulven on the other hand there are voices crying in support of clan stormjarl saying that it is their honor and right to take the fight back to grimward and free those bound into service as for what consequences may come from these actions only time will tell however clan grimward isnt the only area that has had trouble with raiders bandits over the past month have shown some strange tactics in hopes of nabbing supplies for the winter many communities and roads within the city states of new hope are being plagued with these bandits while some are used to this increase in the fall many are taking note of their more frenzied and continued surge being abnormal when compared to previous years syndar on mardrun prepare for a holiday this winter solstice and a rather interesting one at that  back on faedrun those in the kingdom of fawyth would gather around their hearths and tell stories this was to honor of the goddess lyara deity of stories and madness this holiday is said to have a practical reason as well to ward off cabin fever in the deepest dark of the harsh winters  while this winter has been mild thus far many are still upholding the tradition and speaking of legends and myths from so long ago mayhap some new stories are being told this winter work crews in davens hold rejoice at the completion of many buildings before the onset of winter storehouses holdfasts better walls and much more have been built over the past year with this month coming to an end a grand temple and library have been completed by the request of lady alazarma within these walls much of the colonists histories cultures and religions are stored and even some of the late lord alazarmas personal library is now accessible to those who wish to read the buildings are not the only thing sprouting from governess catherines city more and more remnants of vandregon flow to the city gates slowly growing and populating the city while there are only handfuls of people coming by the week there was an instance of where what looked like the remains of a vandregonian army in rusted chain and plate baring the tattered and battered flag of their former unit walking to the city rumors are spreading quickly that this could mean the return of the vandregonian presence upon mardrun that the spirit of vandregon still existsthe continent of mardrun is abuzz with activity between the war the colonies and what happens in the shadows    the war with the mordok tends to take a sour turn this month the mordok forces seem to be showing an unforeseen cunning in their fighting tactics with a few maneuvers they are able to push back the ulven forces to a more defensible position during that fallback the ulven suffered a decent amount of losses in supplies momentum position and in troops however with their feet now planted they are hoping to push back and regain control of the war    however that isnt the only fighting happening with the ulven  it seems a small group of clan stormjarl decided to launch a raid against clan grimward many of the other clans have shown great distress and condemning the actions of clan stormjarl for continuing the war however there a few who are sympathetic in understanding that they are fighting for their honor the response from clan grimward is that of utter lividity of the whole act the consequences for these acts have yet to be seen but many are fearful of clan grimward going on the warpath once more    while chaos continues to grow reports of bandits in the pass in the great wolf hackles continue to grow while it isnt uncommon to hear of bandits going after merchants this time of year it is uncommon for them to be as active as they are many are reporting of the bandits going as far as  killing without questions some even speak of fear and worry in their eyes as to the cause of these feelings no one can guess but there is something stirring up the bandits and it is starting to show if this activity will continue to grow or eventually subside like it usually does it is any persons guesswhile the war wages on to the north in the dirge swamp the rest of mardrun continues their daily lives and hussle of the fall harvests     in starkhaven a large group of heavily armored warriors march northwards towards the swamp and the front lines many of the faces are recognized to be former members of the order of the fist which has been disbanded under new orders to go on a penance crusade this crew of warriors march onwards towards the swamp to either redemption or their deaths    the colony of davins hold has been expanding at an amazingly rapid pace walls have been improved a holding is built store houses are erected a temple and library continue to be under construction it seems the governess catherine is eager to expand as much as possible and become a rival of new hope in scale and size as it stands some of the civilians view such construction projects too hasty and sudden many others say otherwise   davins hold isnt just expanding in buildings also in populace it is now spoken that the colors of vandergon can be seen flown on the banners of her lands there is also words that speak of those whom were once of vandergon making their way to davins hold heeding her call to reform and bring back what was once lost while there are only a few word seems to be spreading at an alarming speed    meanwhile back in city state of new hope the power vacuum left by the departure of some of the former council has not been forgotten or uncontested for one such noble celestial  arragones has been noted by many to be soaking up the contacts support and influence that has been left by governess catherine and her aides as to how much power she has obtained it cannot be truly guessed at but one could guess that it is more than a fair share of what there was left in the wake    the war is quiet this month as the nearly countless warriors move up to the wall to prepare while there is little fighting at the moment the forces dwell on regrets loved ones dreams and aspirations the forces enjoy this small calm before the storm for what lies before them is what hasnt happened in their written history a united force of ulven numbering over threethousand fighting together against the mordok menace with the coming of the harvests the continent is moving in to a large amount of activity   the colonies of new hope are busy with a large amount of building and improving their slowly growing settlements from walls banks and taverns the colonies are becoming more fleshed out with the abundance of harvest this year however with the harvests comes the bandits it has been noted that the bandit activity for the colonies has also risen but it doesnt seem to be out of the ordinary when compared to previous years    the settlement of aylins reach seems to be oddly busy with a peculiar project it seems that shipwrights and lumber mills in the area are working hard to try and create a large vessel that has been rumored to have been requisitioned by an extremely wealthy noble as for the purpose or use this vessel may serve it has yet to be seen   dominet martingale seems to have thrown another party this month and one to be remembered the harvest festival that was hosted by the martingale quickly turned in to a drunkards haven as nobles merchants and people of name came to this party many were invited and many were let into the event which led to overcapacity of the estate it has been said that four casks of phoenix wine two casks of luna shine twelve casks of wine and four kegs of fine whiskey was consumed in the course of the night along with an almost endless amount of foods the next morning there were people hanging in trees passed out on the roads and incapacitated in every room   the ulven clans continue to push back the mordok lines beyond that of the shield of mardrun they are meeting only mild resistance at best during their fights many are concerned while many are becoming optimistic with the war just right around the corner that their foes will continue to be as difficult as they were before the majority of these thinkers are barely older than pups while the more veteran warriors try their best to remind them that they are only facing the weakest of what the swamp has to offer it seems that persistence has finally paid off clan axhound has agreed to meet with clan whiteoak to begin negotiations between the two as led by pack redwind word quickly spreads outward from axhound territory however that their leadership is unconvinced that clan whiteoak will bring anything to the table much less honor any agreement made still even though it was likely through the continued pressure from pack redwind and clan grimward this could be the vital first step to a lasting peace between clan whiteoak and clan axhound   clan squallborn continues to find itself treading water as they are unable to retake their best farmlands from new aldoria and stormjarl their people continue to ration carefully and while this will certainly keep them away from starvation it has bred a bitterness within them they are raiders and warriors squallborn ships crave the sea as their blades crave the blood of mordok unfortunately for their cravings their current situation will allow them neither as they must focus first and foremost on their own survival   clan axhound has claimed a great feat which while unconfirmed has been supported by the recent stillness of the great forest a warpack led by warleader hoskul axhound himself claims to have slain the mordok shaman which had infested the great forest since the beginning of the year thus far it had eluded capture and combat and while not a largescale threat the caster was more than an inconvenience to those who made their living near the tree line hopefully they can rest a little easier nowgrand duke richards emphatically declares his recent market faire to be a resounding success the mood was high despite the dark times drinks and silver flowed like the yurnai river as merchants set up their tents and hawked their wares to the gathered crowds warriors from across mardrun competed in honorable combat for prizes and the entertainment of the masses even prince aylin made an appearance so far from home and without knowing any better one might think that this was a time of peace prosperity and joy rather than the beginnings of a continentwide war   on a darker note wisps of a rumor have floated around about a massive fight that broke out on the coast near the border of clan grimward apparently the town guard had a revolt on their hands and was barely able to contain the situation before the army had to be called in youd think with something so major you would have heard a bit more about it   pack redwind a clanless pack made up of former members of both clans axhound and whiteoak has been suing for peace between the two rivals for generations though they have doubled their efforts with the shield of mardrun in the forefront of everyones mind their negotiations have been a string of misfortunes however their first negotiator was found dead in whiteoak territory and not through an accident or mordok attack their letters have also been met with stubbornness and pride each side willing to demand sacrifices from the other but neither willing to give anything in return they have expressed however that they plan to continue in their push to unite the clans or at the very least get them to agree to stop killing each other for a little while  as trade in her settlement of davens hold increases governess katherine renews her vigor in recruiting the men and women of vandregon or those who will uphold their ideals of virtue and strength to join her in reforming the once great kingdom recruits have been seen venturing to the town though it can be described as a trickle at best still her heart seems unchanged and her dedication to this reformation has long been considered unshakable   pillars of smoke can be seen rising from starkhaven for miles around tales of the siege eventually spread to every corner of mardrun telling of the negotiations the maneuvering and the battles that took place within those walls ultimately though they settle on the final outcome a large portion of the keep burned to the ground before an agreement was reached the hand of arnath was lost in the fire as was the council of griffins leadership for the order of the fist was taken into custody leading to an uncountable number of rumors about the exact details of what happened   as focus shifts to the eastern front of the shield of mardrun an outpost manned by clan whiteoak is lost to the mordok unable to hold the territory against the constant churning of their enemy the clan is forced to retreat though one of their warpacks is able to regroup with their allies not long after with ulven human and syndar steel glinting in the sun a brutal fight ensues as the dust settles the mordok either lay dead or have long since retreated the outpost once again belongs to clan whiteoak and the shield of mardrunbonfires rage next to funeral pyres as the shield of mardrun continues to meet with success on the western front clan shattered spear with pack dawnrock at the vanguard continue to steadily take territory from the mordok as their allies push construction of outposts along the way to the east however clan whiteoak continues to struggle to keep pace distracted by their ancient rivals to the south the leadership of clan whiteoak has begun to call in favors from other clans pleading with them to put an end to axhound aggression most clans are slow to action on this request seeing the issue as one outside their jurisdiction if they could even spare the resources to help most of whiteoaks support has come from letters bearing the names of branthur nightriver and haygreth grimward each strongly wording their displeasure with axhound   prince aylin has announced recently that he has contracted several of the finest shipwrights in aylins reach to begin construction on a new vessel to be named the ias horizon though he has been accused of doing so simply for publicitys sake the prince has claimed that this ship will be faster and better equipped to handle the waters in and around mardrun than any vessel human or ulven   newhope has seen a recent uptick in security guards at the main gate have nearly doubled and patrols of watch members can be felt around every other corner duchess mary cultricuspis has personally taken to overseeing the training of the new guards while duchess madeline dargent has declared a number of recruitment drives seeking armed warriors to serve as escorts and security to merchant caravans is this a response to the shield of mardrun or to some threat as of yet undisclosed by the leadership   early in the month the forces recalled by the order of arnaths fist moved quickly to secure the keep from the inside out denouncing the corruption inherent in the order of the light they isolated the hand of arnath from the rest of the settlement and implemented a form of martial law in response the order of the light has accused the order of the fist of performing a coup of starkhaven and have moved to cut off supplies effectively besieging their brothers and sisters within their homeswhispers of a coming conflict facing the order of arnath have emerged as troops seem to be retreating within the sturdy walls of starkhaven fist lions and militia stationed in serai have made preparations to return home and it seems the light has been caught by surprise by these actions maybe there was just a miscommunication   to the north clan ironmound has been hard at work supplying the materials necessary to construct a string of military outposts along the shield of mardrun through this grueling effort hammers rang and forges flared songs to the great wolf were raised yet their spirits grew as tired as their limbs many smiths of ironmound are armorsmiths or weaponsmiths eager to forge tools of war for their brothers and sisters they have found a great honor in forging tools for the outposts to be sure but their passionate fires have not been stoked as of late they have seen the light at the end of the tunnel however as the orders for the outposts have been filled slowly but surely soon they can tell themselves we can return to crafting blades shields and mail   in reference to her recent departure from newhopes ruling council governess katherine has officially renamed the settlement of davens reach to davens hold she has also taken to improving the infrastructure and economy of the settlement taking a far more involved route than she had previously her most recent efforts have been to establish exports from the town while baron montesque helps to administer agricultural reform lady alazarma while still removed from any position of official power has been called upon to advise the governess in matters of culture magic and education time will tell how effective these new initiatives prove to befollowing the news of the fracturing of the council of ten much of the work in the citystate has slowed politicians swarm like vultures to help fill the power vacuum left by governess katherine lady alazarma and baron montesque hoping to pick the bones clean after their employers have had their fill grand duke richards seems to be doing his part to keep the citystate running taking a more handson approach with policies and showing his face more frequently to keep the populace satisfied and relaxed celestial arragonnes has also been more of a public figure as many speculate that she may be best suited for the position vacated by katherine   the shield of mardrun has been established and the initial pushes into the swamp to combat the mordok have begun clan shattered spear bolstered not only by their recent absorption of clan riverhead but also by reinforcements from clan grimward has led the charge their assaults have caught the mordok off guard and have proven surprisingly effective to the east however clan whiteoak has struggled to keep pace with their neighbor harassed by clan axhound to the south they have been unable to devote the necessary troops to the shield of mardrun to make matters worse clan stormjarl has refused to lend their substantial martial might to any front where it might directly benefit clan grimward it seems that the wounds inflicted during the civil war have not yet healed   clan squallborn still reeling from the harsh winter and the loss of much of their farmland has been able to cling to hope on the back of wagons sent from clan whiteoak and from around mardrun keeping their demoralized civilians fed throughout the season as the snow melts they have also set about establishing new farms this effort has put them back in a stable position moving forward times may be tough but they will be manageable with proper planning and rationingas political representatives descended upon semya haven in clan ironmound territory the eyes of mardrun fell with them the world looked to the attendees the attendees looked to clan ironmound and clan ironmound looked to the wardens who had been chosen to host the meeting the consensus was that taking the fight to the mordok would be best a charge led by clans nightriver and grimward others held out hope for a more cautious approach or focusing inward instead of kicking the metaphorical hornets nest but their voices were nearly drowned by the vocal support for war more information on this event can be found here   newhope was shaken by the news of the sudden demise of duke alazarma wellrespected among his peers and wellliked among his subjects it was truly a tragedy that fell heavily on the hearts of colonists across mardrun none more so than the heart of his beloved wife duchess alazarma racked by grief and utterly inconsolable she began to withdraw from her duties to the city which did not go unnoticed by her colleagues on the council as if on cue duchess katherines long and storied feud with grand duke richards came to an apparent head with the former officially announcing her retirement from the council granted her old station of baroness and governing authority over the town of davens reach katherine cited irreconcilable differences between the grand duke and herself as her reason for leaving duchess alazarma surprising few departed newhope to follow baroness katherine in the hopes of finding a quieter life alone duke montesque de la aleine surprising many also chose to leave newhope claiming his hands grew soft from years of desk work within the span of a few weeks the mighty council of ten was now the council of six   clans whiteoak and shattered spear have formed a solid wall of warpacks to the north bolstered by their allies to the south these warpacks have begun patrolling the border of the dirge swamp in the hopes of cutting off reinforcements from the few stragglers to the south others have pushed into the great forest harvesting what lumber and stone they can in preparation for the constructions to come clan spiritclaw has continued to work day and night to expel the corruption from ulven lands though their daughters are powerful there always seems to be another site to cleanse or one more step to take they have recruited help from starkhaven though once the war in the swamp begins in full their efforts will likely need to be redirected   reports from the great forest have beendisappointing to many warleaders and chieftains among the ulven skirmish raids have been taking place against settlements lining the great forest from a small but skilled group of mordok supposedly led by a powerful shaman a fastacting corruption has been noted in a number of victims and though casualties have been minimal the target of the raids seems to be supplies local daughters have been able to combat this corruption in most cases and have kept warriors alive but they will be unable to devote their full effort to the war with such a danger lurking just beyond the tree linecoming as little surprise to anyone across mardrun the talk of taverns far and wide is the recent grand moot help in clan ironmounds territory there were a number of rumors regarding the events often contradictory some say fights broke out that left at least one representative dead others claim that the discussions were quick and peaceful speaking to those in attendance and weeding through bad information however paints a more complete picture tensions flared during the meeting as rivals and enemies shared the same ground and as individuals pled their cases before any who would listen at the end of the day a compromise was reached warpacks would scour the great forest and push out the majority of the remaining mordok during the winter months then during the spring thaw smaller settlements would send aid to the border of the swamp to build defenses while the larger clans began an assault on the mordok in hopes of putting them on the defensive while many of those in attendance felt the move was too aggressive and others felt it was not decisive enough it was the plan that was inevitably chosen and has dictated the direction of mardrun for the coming months in addition to the announcement of the mordok hunt beginning in january another declaration took many by surprise clan riverhead has been officially disbanded due to the recent string of losses and tragedy which has befallen their people those who remain have consolidated themselves into the newly reformed pack riverhead which has taken up the offer for protection and vengeance offered by clan shattered spear swords are sharpened and armor is polished as warriors prepare for the coming war though they are not alone in their work with the cure for the creeping corruption confirmed and dispersed coordinated cleansing efforts have begun across the continent it will likely be several months before all of the corrupted are cured though this glimmer of hope has been enough to stave off death for many of the afflicted and to lessen the burden on those settlements housing themwith clan ironmounds grand moot drawing ever closer the thoughts and loyalties of each clan begins to come forth some such as axhound and grimward have urged others to push for a direct assault on the swamp arguing that it is the only way to strike back at the mordok and force them off balance others such as spiritclaw and stormjarl assert that doing so would be at best a waste of resources and at worst suicidal they have instead argued for a more defensive route clearing out the traditionally ulven lands of the mordok and constructing defenses to keep them from venturing south so they can build an army to one day take the fight to the swamp massive changes are coming one way or another one can only hope that the equally massive personalities debating their merits will come to a resolution quickly and peacefully credible sources across the land have been speaking of a cure for the corruption confirmed in the field both on a corrupted person and on the land itself many of these sources point to human settlements as the origin of such a cure though some have named clan spiritclaw or other smaller packs in the discovery to many of the corrupted the credit does not matter all they hope to find out is where to go to be cured following the siege of davens reach several months ago duchess katherine has made a public effort to reinvigorate the settlement through the new baron percival von borscht though momentum was slow to build as were many of the damaged buildings davens reach has begun to hum with commerce once again the continual improvement and patrolling of the grand highway has led to a substantial increase in foot traffic there though new taxes from newhope have kept spirits from rising too high most of the settlement is content to live in peace with little threat of banditry from their leadership although some pine for the days before the siege where life was dangerous but the profits were high time will tell if these attitudes can be tempered though at least one noble certainly hopes they canoctober news and rumors under constant pressure from the mordok to the north clan ironmound finally makes their big announcement in the coming months a grand moot will be called and held though the date and location are yet to be determined clanleaders from every ulven clan is expected to make an appearance notable dignitaries of colonist settlements will also be asked to attend though their presence will be downplayed in relation to their ulven counterparts the stated goal is to determine the course of action of all of mardrun to set forth a path that will lead to the destruction of the mordok and the salvation of the ulven race and that of their colonist guests warleader brynjar riverhead continues his fight against a resilient fever that has rendered him unable to fight or lead his warriors on the battlefield against the mordok forcing them to continue their march further and further away from their homeland with clanleader hakon riverhead slain in the fighting leadership of the clan has fallen to high priestess lyrri riverhead until a successor can be chosen the high priestesss judgement has been called into question by a number of vocal chieftains however accusing her of anything from cowardice to collusion with the mordok to see herself installed as the acting clanleader while she maintains that these claims are baseless her judgement seems to have been clouded as of recently with her choices straying further and further from reality and into a nightmare of paranoia many of those most vocal against the high priestess have put forth her former apprentice camilla birchborne as a replacement the situation near the spire has deescalated greatly following the standoff that nearly came to a head at the end of the month with this distraction removed the allied forces and the colonist settlements have been able to refocus their resources on the still growing corruption that plagues not only the people of mardrun but the land herself though a cure has been developed and initial tests have been promising a proper demonstration in the field has yet to be performed in a bittersweet realization such an opportunity may come sooner rather than later as reports of several new corruption sites springing up across the continent have taxed the sleep of many residents of mardrun mainly far to the north most of these sites reported thus far have come from shattered spear territory though word of similar happenings in whiteoak lands and as far south as clan goldenfield has been notednumbers within clan shattered spear territory have swelled as the bulk of riverheads remaining refugees have fled there putting a large strain on their supplies these ulven are driven however eager to strike back against the mordok that drove them from their homes and shattered spears front lines towards the swamp have been thoroughly reinforced by fresh troops the migration was bittersweet however during their retreat warleader brynjar riverhead was injured and pulled from the fighting noticing the morale of his warriors waning clanleader hakon riverhead took up his spear and shield and joined the fray himself though he fought bravely and bought time for his clan to escape hakon was struck down in the battle his body unable to be recovered homeless and now leaderless the clan is looking to high priestess lyrri riverhead and the recovering warleader brynjar to take the reins of the clan until a new clanleader can be decided stirrings in clan ironmound seem to hint at a decision to be made soon and the tone of these whispers implies that it could change the face of mardrun altogether though their leadership has remained tightlipped about the situation they have stated they will make their announcement in the coming month and will expect a response from each clan mordok continue to press even as they are driven out of the great wolfs hackles focusing instead on clans shattered spear whiteoak and squallborn while shattered spear and whiteoak have the numbers and resources available to defend themselves squallborn is facing an uphill battle with the bulk of their good farmlands taken by aylins reach and the stormborn settlements to their south hungry squallborn warriors have taken to raiding these territories when they are not fighting against the mordok the slowly swelling population of aylins reach has been able to focus on their own defenses building sturdier walls and manning more patrols though it seems the stormjarl priorities are elsewhere for now clan watchwolf has issued an official proclamation one which many understood was coming though few expected so soon clan watchwolf would be no more the watchwolves of luna to the west impressed by their treatment at the hands of clan grimward has opted to officially join the clan feeling that they have failed in their sacred charge by allowing the humans and syndar to remain on mardrun uncontested they have chosen to rename themselves as pack fairtongue in honor of the diplomats they produced early in the war and the countless lives saved by their efforts across the continent the watchwolves of sol have joined clan nightriver keeping their ancestral name they have spoken at length that they do not believe the colonists are the danger they have been watching for and seek to continue their charge however without their western kin to aid them they sought the resources and numbers of clan nightriver for their own protection as the weather begins to cool movement is seen across the continent though it is not the mordok nor warpacks on their way to do battle against the beasts this massive march is headed towards the center of the continent within the great wolfs hackles and is made by units flying the colors of many smaller groups and factions from across mardrun their common destination quickly becomes clear as their intentions are spouted to those who will listen they claim to march on the spire to bring the wanted man vazra to justice many major players across the continent are sitting back and watching the events play out reluctant to throw their lot and resources in with one side or another for a variety of reasons though many details are yet unclear one thing is known this show of force will change the course of mardrun one way or anothermuch to the ire of clan nightriver haygreth grimward has once again pressed his luck by moving a substantial number of warriors into the great wolfs hackles defying the treaty he had signed two winters prior grimward warriors were met with grudging tolerance by colonists and their supporters with tensions kept subdued seemingly only due to the mutual enemy the groups shared in the mordok the combined efforts were able to strike a number of decisive blows against the creatures however forcing branthur to acknowledge the role grimward played in retaking the mountains rumors have begun to spread of progress on the cure for the creeping corruption though little has been confirmed at this point a whisper here a guess there is all it has taken to spread like wildfire in hushed tones those largely unaffected by the corruption have expressed their relief that such suffering will surely be brought to an end soon enough the reaction among the corrupted and their families however is a little more divisive while many are eager to be cleansed and are optimistic for the news others grumble about the lack of transparency among the powers working to develop the cure they want answers and they want them yesterday refugees from clan riverhead continue to search for new homes while their lands remain in the hands of the mordok some have taken to grimward and shattered spear eager to strike back against the invaders others have settled in nightriver or stormjarl lands hoping to blend in and regain some semblance of a normal life still others have taken up hammers and plows with clans ironmound and goldenfield they may not be warriors but they can still provide the tools of war needed to win clan goldenfield has made clear their intention to work tirelessly to harvest food for the coming months between the movement of displaced refugees constant battles against the mordok and fear of a cold winter they hope to stand ready to provide for the needs of mardrun they are requesting assistance in the form of military or economic units to protect and distribute the harvests they are also willing to pay laborers who agree to work their fields in the effort of yielding the greatest harvest recent history has seenwhile the southern end of mardrun enjoyed a rather quiet month with little going on of note the northern end of the continent was filled with activity and most of it revolving around the mordok with clan riverhead territory now fully occupied by mordok forces many clans have started to stockpile resources train warriors and units and seek to guidance from the daughters on what they should do next many are told to prepare others are told to try and change the tide others even recommend taking the fight to the mordok but one thing is certain the ulven in the northern clans are working overtime to prepare for both winter and the oncoming storm they fear or even desire at the market fair wargah grimward daughter of the clanleader of clan grimward came to seek the reason as to why the honorbound citizens to clan nightriver have been disappearing if her claims are to be believed this action has continued for some time and grimwards efforts to locate them have gone unanswered and unaided she wasnt the only representative seen in nightriver territory or in the colonies representatives were seen entering clan nightriver lands with grim looks upon their faces and asking all those they came across for information relating to this issue there were few who could give answers and even more who didnt know that the honor bound ulven have been missing on a related note it seems that holmar bloodmoon has gained a substantial following of supporters from both within clan nightriver and those from outside holmar was seen welcoming the grimward representatives into his home offering them whatever aid he could provide to help them find their missing clan members some are saying this was a bold move for holmar who is not a clan leader but also see it as taking initiative on an issue that been seemingly pushed aside by branthur nightriver since it was brought to his attention word from clan ironmound is that of industry and war for the entire clan is now preparing for what seems to be the end of days smithies work around the clock mines are working in overtime to provide ore trainers are working tirelessly to train new and old warriors alike to top all of this gustav ironmound gave a speech to his pack leaders he asked they work together fight smart and seek and spread the word that the clans need to unite now more than ever or the mordok will win in whatever sick plan they have schemed for the ulven people doom and gloom are not the only feelings to be found in the northern side of mardrun though aylins reach had a sudden increase of colonists coming from the main colony in new aldoria with the sudden burst of citizens many are wondering what is going on to cause it some say the prince secretly started a campaign to migrate all his citizens to the newly acquired land others suggest that maybe new hope is taxing the citizens of new aldoria colony too much whatever the reason may be the expansion of aylins reach settlement seems to be booming with activity and expansionclan riverhead has finally fallen to the endless waves of mordok invaders and the result sends shock waves throughout communities many clans who have been so quiet now start to fear for their livelihoods and wonder are we next many clans in the north seem to be sharing these exact same thoughts as they begin to change pace and directions almost all at once due to the fall of clan riverhead clan stormjarl was noted to have increased their labors to shore up and build on their new settlements around aylins reach the lands on the isle of fire works harder at gathering food and stores for a possible oncoming storm clan stormjarl lands to the south prepare and make plans on how to help their lands in aylins reach and aylins reach lands build with fervor many are working longer and harder days and even nights to secure themselves for a possible attack from either clan squalborn or the new threat in the great forest clan axehound long time bitter rivals of clan whiteoak have been seen pulling back their forces from raiding it seems to be part of multiple reasons such as clan nightriver applying political pressure on the small northern clan to lay off attacking but the largest reason seems to be the fact that clan axehound is now the smallest clan on mardrun it also is located next to the now largest threat on the continent the great forest a place now overflowing with mordok pack leaders from the clan begin to take action to weather the inevitable wave of mordok while daughters of gaia work diligently to seek guidance from gaia and the great wolf on what to do next for their clan due to the retreat of clan axehound forces and the mordok focusing on claiming clan riverhead clan whiteoak gains a momentary reprieve many packs hold almost endless funeral pyres across the lands speckling the landscape with fires for their beloved their brave and their fallen along with their morning the clan also works diligently to recover precious resources that were spent in the defense of their lands on two fronts labor caste smithing caste hunter caste members are worked to the bone to try and meet the demands set by their leaders while the mordok ravaged riverhead lands there were those who stepped up to accept the incoming refugees clan shattered spear and clan goldenfield were some of the main clans that stepped up in helping these folks find a new foothold in their devastated life along with sending aid to the clan in its time of need while many from clan riverhead are thankful their hosts hospitality and attention to helping their people find a new life however it is rare that they show it due to their lives in almost near isolation clan riverhead refugees seem to be clumping together and are socially awkward in their new homes often forming small camps and villages near areas of water a little bit away from their hosts settlements as the invasion comes to an end mordok activity seems to take a brief pause from the usual aggressive stance they seem to be keen on defending the lands they have gained yet do not pursue invaders and attackers unless necessary while many are thankful for this brief moment many are wondering what they are doing in the areas mordok have claimed as their own the colonies have been somewhat uneventful this month mostly focusing on recovering costs and refilling their coffers from the great works which is needed in order to continue during this time many in the council of ten spend their now available free time chasing their own ambitions once more however the destruction of an entire clan has some nobility worried that the mordok threat could be a real one while many others feel that this will fade with the coming of winter as per the usual what is for sure is that the colonies of new hope seem to feel that the events that have transpired in the northern areas of the continent seem to be far off and remotein a joint effort between clans shattered spear and grimward a handful of small outposts and watchtowers are constructed to the north along the edge of the dirge swamp fighting for every inch of land these footholds are seen by many as far more than defensive structures they are a symbol of ulven strength and resilience when clans can band together even so the outposts will prove to be a major boon to defensive efforts to the north and instrumental in cutting off mordok reinforcements to the south if they are properly manned these outposts will do nothing for clan riverhead however after months of fighting a losing battle their lines have finally broken calling for a full retreat from their territory the clanleader and high priestess have been searching for allies to offer them refuge until they can retake their lands they expect many of their warriors to fall while protecting their civilians but believe that this option will cause the fewest deaths and allow clan riverhead to live on in more than stories clan grimward has been creating a political commotion recently fueled by the continued disappearances of their honor bound citizens from nightriver territory while clan nightriver claims to be looking into the matter clan grimward remains unconvinced and is bringing the issue forward to force nightrivers hand in an effort led by wargah grimward a small warpack has been travelling from settlement to settlement across mardrun drumming up support for their investigation despite the pushback from clan nightriver and many of their allies two members of the council of ten have come forth to offer what resources they can lictor mary cul tricuspis and duke joakim ventrini this charge of incompetence has continued to stir the pot of unrest in clan nightriver adding fuel to the evergrowing fire that is holmar bloodmoon and his supporters initially upset my branthurs handling of the treaty with clan grimward they gained a massive surge of support when the clanleader sold off a large portion of their territory to the colonists now it seems they have found yet another foothold from which to erode at branthurs authority they still cling to their message as they spread their beliefs branthur was a great leader but his time has come and gone he is an honorable man but is no longer suited to lead the clan on a brighter note the celebration in aylins reach seemed to only strengthen the bond between the new aldorians and clan stormjarl though raiders from clan squallborn kept the revelers on their toes and nature itself seemed to rebel against the celebration the mood could not be dampened as the sound of games and tournaments split the air from dawn until dusk reports did filter through a number of settlements of strange dreams and anomalies with the mana stream early in the month they stopped suddenly one saturday night late in the month rumors have flown about the true nature of these reports though very little information has trickled down to the rank and file of new aldoria thus farmordok pressure on clan riverhead has begun to reach a breaking point already the creatures have pressed through and nearly separated the clans territory in half allies from across mardrun have sent troops to push back the mordok but they are at best only slowing the assault calls from clan ironmound have echoed across the continent desperately calling for unity in the face of these unprecedented attacks to the south however old wounds fester and sting as clans whiteoak and axhound continue their attacks on each other neither willing to commit troops to the mordok if the other does not do so first other clans inspired by clan grimward are focusing the bulk of their efforts inward reinforcing their own defenses before reaching out to their allies with too great a commitment whatever their motivations clan riverhead will be hard pressed to survive this attack without more aid in the very near future further to the south a great commotion erupted around the settlement of davens reach now once again in newhope lands the citystate declared an effort to retake the town by any means necessary and called for allies to share in the glory and spoils of this feat led by baroness katherine herself the troops of newhope marched sidebyside with their allies against the keep in a show of great mercy these forces scraped together a sizable sum of silver to repay the honest workers who had lived in the reach for the improvements they had made and they agreed to stand aside and let the attackers clean out the less repentant many lives were saved by the gesture though the battle that commenced was bloody nonetheless arrows and rocks fell from the ramparts as the attackers crashed their wooden ram against the gate for what seemed like hours at long last the gate fell and shortly thereafter so did the defenders those that could barricaded themselves in buildings throughout the reach which would have forced a longer bloodier conflict if the attackers had pressed they were soon replaced however by the fresh troops who had called davens reach home who had stood down before the fighting began by the rising of the sun davens reach was once again in the hands of baroness katherine spurred on by the recent deal to part with a large portion of nightriver territory the name and cause of holmar bloodmoon have both been spoken of in more blunt terms some call this a fearful act with the human population growing too large to safely control should their demeanor change others mention the leverage over such a large population that is now forfeit pointing to the citystates focus on their great work rather than pushing back the mordok most of the population however confident in branthurs decision argue that this was the honorable choice the humans and syndar have fought beside the ulven for long enough and shown their tenacity they have earned this land led by a group of adventurers near the dirge swamp a newhope official was sent to shattered spear territory to oversee the reconstruction of a ruined outpost along the swamps border foregoing the farmstead with which the corruptioncuring reagents could possibly be harvested the workers decided to build a defensive outpost to help stem the tide of mordok flowing through to the south though the day was eventful the outpost was eventually completed and the mordok in the area driven off enough to allow the structure to begin operating in full swing newhope is proud to declare that the first round of improvements to their infrastructure has been completed the great highway stretching from starkhaven to crows landing is now operational allowing much faster and easier travel along its length patrols of guards stationed at small posts keep the road relatively banditfree the next task of the great work rumored to be a massive trade network will be put on hold until the fall as such a task would drain the coffers of newhope and raise taxes substantially less proud of their discovery clan nightriver continues to struggle with the disappearance of grimward honorbound workers three more have been reported this month two of which were in the last week alone the patience of clan grimward is beginning to wear thin on this matter and it has been rumored that highranking representatives for the clan have spent an inordinate amount of time in nightriver territory the task has been delegated to wargah grimward daughter of the clanleader she has put out notices asking for any information that might help solve this atrocitysilver begins to flow through newhope as merchants and laborers grow excited about the great highway patrols of newhope guards have kept the roads relatively safe while hamlets and roadside inns spring up like weeds to tend to the needs of weary travelers as the project progresses however it seems that the nobles who did not endorse it have not given up on their own prospects celestial arragones continues to push for support to return to faedrun just as marquess madeline dargent garners resources for another dirge swamp expedition most notable is baroness catherine who has been reaching out to various groups eager to use newhopes new authority to reclaim davens reach from the bandits and thugs who now inhabit it this has caused no small amount of discourse among the people of newhope and of mardrun do the current inhabitants of the reach have the right to be there they took the land by force but many have made a point to make a legitimate living since that time is the zeal shown by the baroness justified in taking back what is legally her property the nobility of newhope is questionable about the precedence set by the baroness actions one way or another marching upon subjected lands with military units could paint newhope as tyrannical to those less concerned with the letter of the law although allowing the squatters to remain on her property could lead to issues down the road if organized bandit groups were to get the idea that such an act is acceptable either way the baroness has announced that she will offer silver to any who help her successfully retake her property with a portion of the spoils of conquest to be divided amongst those who help as well thanks in large part to the combined efforts of clans shattered spear and goldenfield in addition to the warriors of pack longfang the riverhead militia were able to hold back the massive mordok assaults deep into their homes long enough to evacuate most of the clans refugees the tide of the battles began to turn soon after however as the mordok descended again with greater fervor than previously seen and pushed the defenders back they continue to call for aid from their allies to the south hoping to stand firm against the mordok before their homes are destroyed clan riverhead is not alone in facing increased aggression from the mordok clan grimward has noted a shocking number of attacks coming from the great wolfs hackles the leadership of the clan remains unsure as to how such large numbers of mordok were able to move so far south undetected though the true priority now is organizing an effective defense this means that many of the grimward warpacks in shattered spear territory have been called home to defend their families instead clan whiteoak saw a small glimmer of hope this month though they have been fighting battles on two fronts the aid sent from various allies and neighbors has allowed them to focus their own resources on pushing back against the mordok and for the first time in months they did not lose ground though their situation is still dire it would seem that if current trends continue clan whiteoak will survive to see the summer though the unpredictable string of attacks on various clans do not leave much room for optimism finally clan shattered spear has announced that they have had a great deal of luck pushing the mordok back along their border though the fight is not over yet more than ever they are focusing their efforts on fighting the expansion of the swamp a phenomenon that has been documented over the last several months they are asking for help in this endeavor preferably in the form of casters able to research and fight the corruption or warriors to prevent the mordok from pressing in any furthertown hall meetings are scheduled and filled across newhope each drawing representatives from every member of the council of ten and other invested parties it is no secret that they hope to determine the direction of newhopes new project dubbed the citys great work to celebrate their purchase of territory from clan nightriver while surely a joyous moment for newhope other settlements whose land was purchased as a part of this deal including new aldoria starkhaven and davens reach are less than thrilled with the arrangement after a great deal of discussion debate and argument it seems the lord baron richards has been swayed to direct the efforts of the officially dubbed citystate of newhope towards the expansion and improvement of the infrastructure of the territory plans for new farmsteads and mills are drafted and laborers are contracted to work on a great highway stretching from starkhaven to crows landing linking each settlement in between small hamlets begin to pop up along this planned road both to act as rest points for travelers and to capitalize on the economic boon such a route will doubtlessly provide as if on cue merchants travelling through the territory of the new citystate have reported a noticeable increase in banditry it seems the scoundrels are also eager to hear of the project and have already begun harassing the main roadways for the time being guards recommend using extreme caution while travelling between settlements following the announcement there is a surprising lack of response from prince aylin and new aldoria representatives for the prince attended each of the meetings and reports from others have been compiled and presented though sources close to him revealed that the prince was livid with these actions he has made no public declaration of his intentions moving forward this silence has created a vacuum in which rumors abound some say the prince has accepted the ruling and is now a subject of newhope some believe he established a deal with lord baron richards to benefit himself while others claim to have seen him mustering an army one man has even been drunkenly theorizing that the prince himself was behind the purchase working behind the scenes to orchestrate these events for now though there has been nothing to confirm nor refute any of these claims elsewhere in colonist lands word of starkhavens struggle has spread shouldering the burden of nearly two hundred refugees it has become clear that the fortress is not staffed nor stocked to handle so many sick residents worse whispers of the corruption beginning to spread as the afflicted fall to their curse are heard though are often discredited by the faithful blue and green flags carried beside carts flying red gold and black banners were sighted approaching the keep several weeks ago and merchants from new aldoria have confirmed that the wagons were carrying food and blankets to comfort the sick and ease the burden of starkhaven unfortunately reports from inside starkhaven suggest that these greatly appreciated supplies will still not be enough to sustain the refugees for long the order of arnath continues to put out requests for groups to send more aid hoping to make progress against the corruption rather than simply holding it at bay clan whiteoak has announced that they have begun to stabilize their current situation with a handful of reinforcements from the colonists allowing them to divert more forces northward and to hold the line against the mordok though they have not been winning any decisive battles hope has begun to work its way back into the hearts of clan whiteoak another call for aid goes out hoping to begin to make a push against the mordok who seem to never tire or dwindle in number even as the whiteoak stores continue to run low clan ironmound has called a moot among their leadership to determine whether to send aid to whiteoak or not and it seems that other groups will soon be following suit after watching the events around them unfold and putting out several fires both literal and metaphorical in their own territory clan ironmound calls out for mardrun to send aid north to fight against the mordok though their resources are limited now clanleader gustav has offered to give what help they can in the form of arms armor and warriors but their contributions alone will far from enough to press the mordok back on the other side of the great forest however the news is far less joyous clan riverhead reports a drastic increase in the number of mordok raids across their settlements with daughters of gaia disappearing and warriors being captured and returned reeking of corruption warleader brynjar riverhead reluctantly admits that should clan riverhead face the same assault weathered by clan whiteoak they will likely be exterminated quickly though the attacks thus far have not been a concentrated effort the trends of mordok movement in recent weeks makes the clan nervous about such a possibility and they hope that they might see the same aid as clan whiteoak scouts and hunters have reported sightings of large groups of mordok amassing in the great forest seemingly preparing for a large scale attack on clan riverhead though some settlements are confident in the strength of their warriors and their walls others have begun the evacuation process hoping to get civilians to safety before things take a turn for the worsefollowing the uproar caused outside the plague district late last year many of the refugees acted upon their displeasure with newhope frigid and hungry they made a show of leaving the settlement seeking refuge within the walls of starkhaven as was expected many of the corrupted who left newhope did not survive the journey succumbing to their illnesses wounds or the elements before reaching safety the keep though faring better than in years past has struggled to maintain peace and order with the massive influx of over a hundred new mouths to feed paired with the ire drawn from those who see it as a slight against newhope or an avoidable tragedy discontented whispers have begun referring to this pilgrimage as the path of agony mockingly shortened to the path as a play upon the tenets of arnath commonly referred to by the same name diplomats wearing the blue and black of clan nightriver have been seen heading northward approaching the great forest entering clan riverhead territory on their way those they have interacted with have confirmed that the group is making their way to clan axhound though their purpose there is rumored to be any number of things clan whiteoak has issued a public declaration thanking those who have come to their aid with this assistance they have managed to reallocate their warriors and prevent the mordok from taking any more ground though they are still struggling to stay alive and their ranks thin every day a glimmer of hope for the future has emerged the declaration continues to remind the people of mardrun that the offer for payment still holds should any form of aid be sent to help protect the clan though food and supplies are most desperately needed at this point there is rumor of a meeting taking place between clan ironmound and some allies and the leadership of clan whiteoak but little is known clan riverhead has mobilized several warpacks to defend their roads a move which took many other clans who were unaware of their situation by surprise the few reports which have managed to reach the outside world seem to indicate that clan riverhead is seeing a substantial increase in mordok raids over the last few weeks with many reports of travelers along oncesafe roads emerging beaten bloody and corrupted worse yet an entire warpack seems to have disappeared into the great forest and recent attacks have kept the clan from searching them out the public release of this knowledge proves that the mordok presence in the great forest has grown considerably and is much more dangerous than it has been in the past organized banditry reports have increased across mardrun but mainly in the clan nightriver and colonial territories the vague territories of several groups are perfect hiding places and breeding grounds for outlaws and vagabonds some of the attacks have become more daring or concentrated and some worry that a crime boss may have begun to orchestrate these attacks initially fingers were pointed to davens reach but reports say that the settlement has been dealing with rooting out several murders in their settlement along with a calm but persistent struggle for power within it is hard to speculate at this time who could be involved as reports come in regarding the daring expeditions to head into the dirge swamp during the winter one thing is for certain mordok activity in the swamp remains active despite the cold and smaller expeditions may not be enough to make the final venture to get through to the other side nobody knows for sure what this means for the momentum of the marquess and her campaign to fund or further expeditions but one of the caravans sent into the swamp returned with startling news that is spreading quickly the swamp already home to foul corruption magic has inside its borders some sort of area that is heavily influencing the mana stream mages have reported that mana in the area was much harder to recover the scholars under the employ of celestial arragones have had a conference on these findings syndar mages have reported that this phenomenon seems consistent with their ongoing study of the siphoning and its effects on the decline of the mana stream brushed off as conspiracy theories of obsessed mages there may be more to this and rumor has it that anyone with knowledge or notes regarding the siphoning or similar effects may stand to make a profit for contributing to their research despite the recent debacle involving the exodus of refugees to starkhaven all that most people seem to be able to talk about is the upcoming dinner discussing the future of newhope and their legacy on mardrun rumors abound discussing the possible topics more than that however is the attendance of the meeting if some looselipped aides and thirsty connections are to be believed at least one of the nobles from the council of ten has taken a very personal approach to this matter potentially to the point of representing themselves rather than having a lesser noble do the legwork for them with the exception of baroness catherine in recent years such an act would be nigh unheard of in such an open forum and would assuredly lend more weight to their cause but could also put them at very serious risk should negotiations turn sour only time will tell how accurate these tales truly are howeverin many ways newhope has drawn the attention of mardrun in recent weeks the protests which devolved into violence in the plague district outside the citys walls has raised eyebrows both in favor of the city guard in quieting the situation before more blood was shed and in favor of the refugees who many believe acted inappropriately though understandably considering their plight in the end a few of the corrupted succumbed to their wounds and the harsh winter weather though most could be saved and once again promised a cure unfortunately time has been running out for these poor souls and unless a simpler cure is found soon there may be no saving them to this end celestial arragones has paired with baron richards and the daughters of clan riverhead to ask for aid from those skilled in the ways of nonmagical healing to come to the city and help treat the corrupted through the winter in exchange for payment from the celestial herself as always assistance with the research is still in high demand as well across the city however attentions are focused elsewhere while celestial arragones has her hands full working towards the cure and has been backed by lord baron richards considerable resources their projects are far from alone in newhope marquess madeline continues to push for support for her expedition through the dirge swamp hoping to send a group north in the coming months to blaze the trail with the thought that the winter will make the ground easier for wagons to handle and will drive the mordok into hiding for warmth in particular she has expressed a strong need for a map or guide through the swamp one which proves reliable in this trip and is willing to pay handsomely should such an item be procured and verified in the wake of such horrific events which have transpired recently it would seem that the weight of duke joakim ventrini lictor mary cultricuspis and dominet martingale have each been thrown towards the entertainment and morale of their fine city rather than the darkness outside her walls together they have been working to secure a large enough tract of land and shipment of supplies to begin construction on an arena hoping that doing so will distract the populace and keep them content little more is known about this project as it seems development has been stalled as the three disagree about key details although the lord baron has seemingly made his priorities clear at the moment he has announced a celebratory dinner to be held in february in which cases might be made for other ventures as well caught between attacks in the north and the south clan whiteoak has made it clear that they are quite grateful to those who have lent them aid though they still fear it may not be enough while more troops would be welcomed and fed to the best of their ability high priestess helka whiteoak has made it clear that their stores are dwindling quickly with the onset of winter and shipments of food and supplies is critically needed as nightriver scouts report the completion of the fortifications within the wolfs hackles pass grimward comes forward with an announcement of their own they have been following the movements of small bands of mordok in the hackles a disturbing enough revelation considering the season these reports have been corroborated by clan ironmound who has made a note of large numbers of mordok moving north along the mountains though seemingly no farther although they have found cause for joy with the progress made towards a cure for the corruption clan spiritclaws morale has been tempered by tragedy a warpack bound for clan whiteoak never reached its destination three young warriors returned from the forest thankful to be home though they brought tales seemingly out of a nightmare they claim they were beset by a tribe of mordok in numbers they have not yet seen in one place the others were savagely mauled when they tried to fight and the three were commanded to run by their chieftain so that word of the event might reach the rest of mardrun no one has ventured into the great forest as of yet to confirm or refute these claims and it would seem that a number of their fellow villagers do not believe their story and have accused them of simply being cowardsshattered spear daughters have focused their efforts recently on investigating the edge of the dirge swamp what is causing it to expand what does this mean for the civilized half of the continent how can it be stopped so far their research has only produced more questions they have invited any knowledgeable in the ways of magic to come forth and assist them in their research impressing upon you all the dangers this could pose to life on mardrun traders have mentioned the walls of davens reach long ago a welcome sight to weary merchants and travelers have become less welcoming in recent weeks though trade continues it would appear security inside the town has been heightened and the people within the walls seem to be on edge though many remain tightlipped on the matter a local a few drinks deep has made it known that a pair of murders has taken place within the town one guard and a blacksmith were slain about a week apart inside the walls though no connection motive or suspects have been named at this time the guards have taken additional measures to dissuade acts of violence such as these in the future including limiting visitors to the town with the end of harvest season upon us the crowd outside of newhope has swelled substantially leading to growing concerns among the city guard lord baron richards and marquess madeline dargent both remain adamant about not involving the newhope army fearing the potential rapid escalation of fears and violence that could erupt they have begun asking for help in keeping the peace outside of their gates hoping that outside groups can help quell the fears of riot or rebellion whether this is through dissuading action through martial presence appeasement through mercantile donations supplies to keep the sick fed and sheltered in the coming months or a friendly or familiar presence to calm the fears of the crowd newhope is asking for all the help they can get growing increasingly desperate and frustrated with the lack of a response from the other clans and colonies clan whiteoak continues to call for aid with the mordok aggression to the north drawing most of their attention and leading to a great number of casualties in the clan their enemies to the south clan axhound has been able to push further than ever into whiteoak lands sacking and raiding small villages rumors and reports also seem to hint at a shift in power within clan whiteoak though neither the cause nor the effects of this supposed shift have come to light though the corruption remains in the foreground of most conversations across mardrun a number of colonial nobles have taken to thinking about longerterm goals encouraged by their colleagues across the colonies aides and assistances have dropped casual remarks in conversations about powerful individuals including members of the former council of ten and within new aldoria seeking to establish for themselves a legacy to live on beyond their own lives what these great works would entail has yet to be decided as has the loyalty and willingness of mardrun to assist them in their plans though surely soon enough ideas will begin to filter out into the public to drum up popular support for these movers and shakers one such campaign that has regained momentum following the talks of legacies is marquess madeline and her efforts to push through the dirge swamp she has already commended those responsible for the information gained in august and has held memorial services for those who did not return now she has renewed her push to return this time in the winter as the ground freezes once muddy stretches should become firm ground over which carts and wagons can easily be pulled the mordok have been known to retreat from civilization during the colder months and their lack of activity could lead to a safer voyage north this will of course be an extensive undertaking requiring a great deal of time and resources to pursue and will likely not be a safe journey regardless of the conditions as the winter will present an array of new issues to be overcomeunease across newhope continues to spread as the crowd outside the gates grows by the day refugees seeking a cure for the corruption have begun to stymie travel in and out of the city a fact which greatly displeases the healthy merchants within its walls though research has continued in recent months a truly safe cure has yet to be found still threatening a lifealtering injury whispers begin to circulate that there is no safer way to be discovered though celestial arragones and her scholars insist that there is another breakthrough out there one claim they cannot deny however is that the supply of saints grace and suns kiss each critical in the cleansing ritual is far too small to help the crowd outside many fear that decisions will soon need to be made fearing the loss of life or limb to the corruption the city guard seems to have its hands full hoping to quell protests before they gain too much traction though marquess madeline dargent has been hesitant to involve the newhope military for fear of rapid and violent escalation of the situation with the harvest season soon coming to an end and many returning from their fields for the winter though it remains to be seen how much the crowd will swell and how dire the need for extra hands will become in newhope as the weeks pass calls for aid from clan whiteoak continue to increase in frequency and desperation by their accounts they may soon be facing a truly dire situation at the hands of not only the mordok but by clan axhound as well the smaller clan has taken advantage of the distraction from the mordok to resume raiding border settlements once again drawing the ire of many larger clans across mardrun though no direct action at this point the promise of compensation for warriors and supplies has been repeated yet again hoping to appeal to the greed of mardrun as their appeal to compassion has yielded few results what began as a simple protest by a disgruntled ulven has grown and twisted itself into the beginnings of a rebellion holmar bloodmoons issues with branthur nightriver have fallen on many ears and more and more have granted those words a great deal of weight it would appear that holmar has already met with a handful of chieftains from clan goldenfield and sown the seeds of discontent among the longstanding ally of clan nightriver though the clan has not officially thrown their lot in with either side of the discussion the rising tensions between the two groups could very well encourage those invested in the outcome to join in the discussion while defending their homes from the mordok in the area a number of shattered spear hunters have returned with worrying reports that confirm the dire news brought forth a number of months ago the dirge swamp is expanding though still hardly noticeable maps of the area indeed show that what was once unclaimed land or farming plots has descended into rot and ruin and a family has reported lost their home as a result shattered spear and grimward daughters of gaia have announced that they will be cooperating to combat this infection from spreading further though they invite any who may have knowledge or a desire to assist to come forward and join themonce again the calls for help from clan whiteoak make their rounds their words echoing the desperate nature of their current situation they plead for any help able to be given be it food and supplies tradesmen to keep their villages running or healers and smiths to make sure their warriors stay alive warriors are in especially high demand and clanleader lamont whiteoak has begun offering generous compensation to any who choose to lend their aid though specifics have not been given at this time a number of other clanleaders particularly those who allied with clan nightriver in the civil war remember the treachery and dishonest ways of clan whiteoak during the early years of the war and are hesitant to involve themselves to any substantial degree some chieftains have also remarked that patience may be necessary to measure the true strength and skill of the mordok as they have never before been known to push this aggressively against a single clan though the call to arms put forth by clan whiteoak has still largely gone unanswered many have been shocked by the response from clan axhound in this time of most desperate need clan axhound has sent their warriors deeper into whiteoak territory continuing their raids against their greatest rival other groups have been heard planning to join clan whiteoak whether it be for the promise of payment or in the hope of saving a clan from what might be total destruction if these attacks persist chieftain holmar bloodmoon in his venture to shake clan nightrivers faith in their clanleader over the treatment of his cousin and former warleader of the clan has been gaining a noticeable following around mardrun much of his rhetoric has been to discredit branthur as a weak leader and a coward too afraid to stand up to the enemies he had bested though much of clan nightriver has still chosen to follow the current clanleader holmar has been steadily gaining the support of a number of chieftains across nightrivers substantial territory the banners of pack bloodmoon are rumored to have been spotted in nearby clans as well most noticeably in the lands of clan axhound goldenfield and stormjarl the axhound chieftains seem to support his more aggressive stance on a number of issues though some are accusing them of merely joining in hopes of using the might of nightriver to finally crush their hated neighbors clan whiteoak chieftains of goldenfield have taken a liking to holmars denunciation of branthurs tactics for handling the revelation of undead on mardrun as they would have preferred to see a more unified heavyhanded approach towards wiping out the abominations and those who harbor them many stormjarls are still harboring resentment for branthurs decrees regarding the reparations they felt they deserved all in all these meetings could put clan nightriver in a tenuous position both politically and martially branthur has stood his ground thus far however defending his actions and decisions as having saved countless lives in the process newhope has continued with their push for more research into a cure for the corruption sweeping across mardrun hoping to develop a safer version of the current ritual that being said they have managed to stockpile a number of reagents used in the ritual and have begun to use them to cure the afflicted the process is slowgoing as the ritual takes time and the logistics of a venture of this scale are complicated to say the least bureaucracy and politics have bogged down the process further and has begun to cause a deep panic to set in among the common people waiting to be healed with the harvest season in full swing farmers grow anxious and angry that their fields remain unattended while they stand in line for a cure grumblings have broken out and small fights have erupted at times though the city watch has been able to handle such incidents quickly and peacefully still with the winter fast approaching and the crowd outside of newhope not dwindling fast enough many families could be forced to endure a dangerous winter alone as the trial in starkhaven continues to drag on many are beginning to wonder about what is going on inside the keep the hand of arnath himself has recently issued a formal statement to the people of mardrun hoping to reassure them that everything is under control in the statement he cites the substantial charges against those involved and the grave sentences they may carry insisting that the order is committed to dealing justice to the guilty while sparing the innocent this has led to a much more thorough process than may have otherwise been used and many are starting to whisper that perhaps a number of the men and women on trial are intentionally dragging the process out to delay their own sentencing one way or another the issue will supposedly be put to rest very soonas the recent trial following the inquisition of fire commences in starkhaven rumors spread like wildfire among those unable to be in attendance some say the accused have already been executed and the entire trial was a cover others imply that the citizens of serai were themselves undead and were smitten upon entering the keep still more would have you believe that constant fights have broken out leading to the delay in proceedings without attending in person none can know for sure if any of these are true or not though one thing is for certain the outcome of the trial will be the news of the year as battered and broken warriors pull themselves from the grips of the swamp and the combined efforts of the militaries of mardrun return from their campaigns of distraction marquess madeline dargent proudly proclaims to the world that the expedition despite a number of unfortunate losses was a rousing success the blackwing outpost was reportedly discovered and cleansed of the corruption believed to have driven out the original inhabitants and the mordok were kept at bay long enough for a sizable group to break through into the swamp and determine that such a foothold could be taken and maintained with proper planning much was learned about the swamp and how to navigate its perils allowing for easier movement in the future should more expeditions such as this be funded more than that however she claims the venture was a political victory the likes of which have not been seen since the treaty was signed to end the civil war bringing together clans colonists and individuals to prove that together even the swamp cannot stand against us amidst this joyful celebration however lie the disgruntled murmurings of haygreth grimward pack blackwing still retains a place of honor among clan grimward and many still bear the name the clanleader has made it known that the outpost is still considered grimward territory and is insulted that such an expedition would be mounted without grimward support in more news from newhope the lord baron richards has proudly and officially announced that they are in possession of a cure for the corruption and are working tirelessly to refine it to make it more efficient and safer this has led to a great migration into the colony as the corrupted all hope to be cleansed before they lose their lives many are beginning to panic about this recent development however noting that the number of sick inside the city could bring catastrophic consequences and should the demand for a cure outpace the supply desperate people will resort to desperate measures possibly leading to unrest protests and even riots the newhope guard has been mobilized to help combat these threats though their numbers may not be enough if the tide of corrupted is not stemmed soon on a quieter front little news has come out of the settlement of davens reach as of recently while reports of banditry still permeate the surrounding countryside their frequency has dropped to levels similar to the larger colonies and most of the correspondence from them seems to be encouraging willing investors to send food or trade to the town in hopes of spurring their economy before the winter falls painfully remembering the treatment of his cousin kragen the chieftain holmar bloodmoon has begun to organize a rebellion within clan nightriver shaking the largest clan to its core while many including much of the colonist population laud branthur for the diplomatic steps taken to end the war and ensure such atrocities do not happen again others have branded him a coward who is now bending his knee to the demands of a defeated enemy they feel he is showing weakness and are rallying behind holmar though his following is small at the present those in his movement are fervent in their cause and could prove to be a symptom of a much larger issue for months clan whiteoak has asked for help for warriors or supplies to help them push back against the constant mordok raids and festering corruption in their lands whether due to their past dishonorable actions or the active campaigning of clan axhound to keep aid from their ancestral foe other clans seem hesitant to commit any support to clan whiteoak the clan is beginning to grow ever more desperate realizing that soon enough something will have to give hoping that their cries will not fall on deaf ears just as those of their whiteoak neighbors clan riverhead has once again taken to public forums to denounce clan stormjarl and new aldoria for their conquest of squallborn lands they have applied what political pressure they can to those groups hoping to encourage them to give back the lands they took while simultaneously pushing clan squallborn to sign the nightriver treaty and preserve the lands they were able to keep no word from either side of the conflict has been forthcoming regarding these demands as if the constant threat of mordok hadnt been enough already the combined shattered spear and grimward patrols have reported yet another disturbing development in the mordok tactics recently while infighting has always been commonplace among the mordok it often worked to the benefit of the ulven reducing the overall effectiveness of their opponents through disorganization and damage sustained from these skirmishes if recent reports are to be believed this has undergone a dramatic change in the last few weeks the losers of these battles are now seeming to fall in line behind the victors rather than returning to the swamp as they had before not only does this result in a larger force but in a more organized group led by a single alpha or shaman rather than several smaller disjointed groups vying for control how this will play out in recent months has yet to be seen but it cannot be a good signcontinuing the rebuilding efforts following the war clan grimward has sought to consolidate their gains conquered watchwolf and stormjarl settlements are converted into outposts and those fields are tended by honorbound laborers although they have been disturbingly quiet on the world stage as of late clan grimward does make sure to weigh in on the undead scandal they will be watching and if it is not handled to their satisfaction they will hold clan nightriver collectively responsible hoping to end this conflict quickly and effectively clan nightriver has opened their lands to the jurisdiction of the order of arnaths fist who had confirmed the presence of undead in serai with this concession came two publicly stated stipulations however the first is that clan nightriver be made a part of the judgment of the accused and the second being that the information uncovered also be shared with clan grimward hoping to ease tensions between the clans through transparency many watch with bated breath as the investigation commences with eyes fixed on the order and on branthur nightriver himself whispers hint that a number of his senior chieftains are displeased with his some of his actions and vision of the future of clan nightriver and some speculate that if the trial goes poorly it could be the catalyst of a greater schism within clan nightriver as the world seems mired in chaos spurred by the mordok corruption and the heavyhanded response of clan axhound the military maneuvering of clan stormjarl and new aldoria and the revelation of more undead on mardrun lord baron richards eagerly announces that the colony of newhope has found a cure to the corruption and that great progress has been made towards developing even better versions it fueled by the research of the scholars of newhope a number of reagents have been discovered that seem to actively fight the corruption and allow it to be removed from the body in a lessthanlethal manner word is sent immediately to the clans and settlements and people rejoice painting the leadership of newhope as heroes in this dark hour the research is far from complete however and a truly safe method of cleansing is desired the push for such a method will be by his own words led by the lord baron himself aided by the substantial library of celestial arragones rumors float around about the validity of the lord barons claims as it was known that adventurers and members of various groups had been working on a cure or its research the claim to have worked on and found the cure seemingly bold by the lord baron such a glimmer of hope for a cure has inspired the nobles of newhope to shift their focuses from petty squabbles and daily duties to instead grant their full support to the order of arnaths fist in resolving their inquisition as a result the order has been given full jurisdiction in regards to the inquisition within the territory of newhope and lictor mary cul tricuspis has been seen working closely with the order to establish bounties on those summoned to trial but who refuse to attend spurred by the backing of both newhope and clan nightriver the order of arnaths fist has been able to expand their investigation substantially those who surrendered themselves into custody have been treated surprisingly well considering the charges levied against them though they are kept under close guard and watched heavily the orders first eagle has been coordinating with lictor mary cul tricuspis to post bounties on those wanted individuals who have thus far evaded capture either in response to accusations and rumors or a planned response from the beginning the hand of arnath has given an official statement the order intends to hold a free peoples trial and invite clans and other colonies to assist with the passing of judgment but will carry out the sentences to see this through the chance to stand as jury to this trial and be involved will most likely not be missed by those able to participate to the east clan stormjarl and new aldoria work actively to establish themselves in their new territories the western half controlled by clan stormjarl has been dubbed the stormborn settlement taken by many to be a jab at the squallborn who were forced out the eastern half under new aldorian control has named their territory aylins reach a tribute to their reigning monarch while both settlements are inundated with plans for construction and consolidation of their new lands both prince aylin and the chieftain fulkha stormtooth were seen in attendance on the fire isle to celebrate and deal together in the north clan grimward finds many eyes turned their way both good and bad their recent aid to clan shattered spear has been taken as an attempt to foster the once strong bond of brotherhood between clans while others see it as an opportunity for grimward to gain a powerful ally in the future should haygreth seek to renew his assault on mardrun whatever their motives however clan shattered spear has repeatedly expressed their gratitude for the assistance in a somewhat surprising move the chieftain in charge of the remaining western watchwolf settlement has sworn fealty to clan grimward after seeing their honorable actions following the war and taking into account the exceptional treatment of the conquered watchwolves this has caused a great deal of anger from the eastern watchwolves who have begun to sever all ties to their former brothers and referring to themselves simply as the watchwolf clan this month officially marks the dissolution of the watchwolves of luna the western settlement of the clan clan whiteoak has come forward very vocally calling for assistance against the mordok the continued assault on their settlements has taken a heavy toll and many residents cannot see an end in sight without aid from their former ally clan grimward clan whiteoak is hoping to muster what help they can from other clans or factions few of these groups have come forward quickly however far too vividly remembering the dishonorable actions of clan whiteoak over the years as the mordok threat continues to apply pressure to the northern clans a number of chieftains have begun pushing for a meeting of the clans to discuss this threat they say it is clear these mordok with their tactics favoring cunning over brutality are different than the ancestral foe they have fought all throughout history dissidents argue that the threat may be greater than normal but not worth calling the clanleaders together to deal with as a whole others are unwilling to so readily forgive their many battle scars and work with those against whom they so recently fought if such a meeting is to take place it is likely that it will either take a great deal of time or will result in greater conflict among some clans neither of which are ideal outcomes on the 60th anniversary of the grand alliance forming in faedrun against the undead and penitent plague a similar challenge appears to be influencing the political structure of mardrun as wellthough progress has been relatively slow since the end of the war construction of a number of defensive structures in the pass through the great wolfs hackles is nearing completion lack of supplies animosity between workers on both sides and the new spreading corruption have caused their fair share of delays but overall the project has been hailed as a triumph by bringing together workers from clans nightriver grimward and ironmound others however have pointed to the possibility of a rekindling of the inferno of war which may only be exacerbated by structures such as these offering substantial strategic value so near an enemys border whispers have even begun to circulate pointing at the profit made by this construction that has lined the coffers of clan ironmound inquiring whether more sinister or at least selfish motives are to blame continuing to ride the fervor and fear spread by the mordok marquess madeline dargent again issues a call for supplies to be procured for an expedition into the dirge swamp this first venture set to depart in august will be a preliminary journey north hoping to establish a forward base in the dirge to facilitate further endeavors resources of all kinds are requested and it is expected that the marquess will release a more formal announcement soon to expand on some of these details on the other end of mardrun word begins to trickle south that the so called inquisition of fire accompanying an investigative force dispatched by the orders of arnaths fist and light has broken out into combat with the citizens of serai with a number of noncombatants fleeing from reported mordok attacks on the settlement as well following a report from the order of arnaths fist warriors from pack goldenfield have mobilized and will seek to reinforce those currently fighting for the settlement destroy all that remains of the undead and drive the mordok back as the mordok continue to press southward the brunt of the fighting has taken a heavy toll on clans whiteoak and shattered spear with reinforcements from clan grimward shattered spear has weathered the attacks fairly well though whiteoak defenses are beginning to crumble in the face of constant bombardment colborn whiteoak warleader of the clan has issued a call to mardrun asking for assistance in this struggle before his clan can no longer maintain their lines cries of outrage and sorrow echo across mardrun as word of the quarantined axhound village spread seeing no other option to halt the spread of the corruption warleader hoskul axhound made the difficult choice to treat the village like a gangrenous limb and remove it by sword and flame over one hundred people were killed in the incident other clans have decried the actions as barbaric though clan axhound has stood by their decision adding that those who chose to die with honor were given a warriors death a number of clans axhound included have planned vigils to be held for the many souls lost that fateful day amidst this darkness however hope shines clan spiritclaw has come forward with a great deal of progress in the fight against the corruption putting forth the ritual they have recently discovered while entirely successful at cleansing the target of corruption clan spiritclaw still urges caution when performing this ritual the brutality inflicted upon the subject to purge the sickness is astounding taking the lives of most who seek this treatment the colony of newhope has countered this announcement however by making a proclamation of their own their clerics and healers have discovered a ritual that also works to remove the corruption from ones body though no deaths have been reported to this method the truth to these claims and the conditions they contain have not been fully investigated however a number of individuals have come forward claiming to be rid of corruptiona great deal of progress has been made over the last few weeks in regards to research on the corruption word has spread that an individual was actually cleansed of the corruption and by a small child no less though many in the colony of newhope have publicly denounced these rumors as a tall tale or even a hoax intended to give false hope where results are needed along similar lines a handful of additional deaths have been reported from the quarantined village in axhound territory the bodies are burned quickly as the corruption reportedly decays the corpse rapidly deep within the great forest a bittersweet moment struck clan spiritclaw as one of their daughters of gaia managed to eradicate one of the more stubborn corruption sites though reports say that she gave her life in doing so clan spiritclaw has confirmed these reports and commended the daughter for her selflessness though they urge others to use this method only as a last resort to the east a great number of ships and caravans have been seen in the lands once held by clan squallborn now in the hands of new aldoria and clan stormjarl these shipments bear the unmistakable resources needed to begin construction of settlements revealing what may well be prince aylins true motivation for the raids this move has been met by strong political opposition particularly from clans nightriver and riverhead who have both denounced the move as dishonorable and disgraceful despite their vocal support of clan squallborn clan grimward has remained fairly silent on the matter if the mordok werent bad enough rumors of undead to the north in the settlement of serai have circulated around the continent for the past few weeks fueled by the pained memory of the famous betrayal by the maykar dominion their presence has yet to be confirmed the same can be said for outside assistance that serai might have received in producing these abominations should they exist a number of fingers have been pointed at the archons considering a number of factors including their association with bos mezar in the past the achmages history with the undead and the spires affinity for magic the order of arnaths fist hoping to either confirm or refute these rumors has dispatched a detachment of lions to serai in order to investigate fearful of a new plague on top of the mordok activity recently clan goldenfield has also expressed a deep concern over the possible reemergence of the undead the normally docile clan has pledged two warpacks a substantial promise considering the small size of their military to put down the undead should the rumors prove to be true clan ironmound has extended the offer to interested craftsmen and healers around mardrun the corruption has hit them hard physically and economically causing many of their forges to be shut down as smiths and their families succumb to the illness offering apprenticeships and contracts in exchange for service clan ironmound hopes to find volunteers to keep their anvils ringing or healers to help treat their smiths and warriors that they might do so themselves word of mouth around the colony of newhope would have listeners believe that an old form of entertainment is returning though far from the glory of the old days small arenas devoted to blood sport funded and supported by a number of nobles have been quickly erected for as many stated purposes duke ventrini hopes to foster a stronger bond with the ulven people mimicking their honor duels in bouts of skill reminding observers of a simpler time when combat was a noble pursuit rather than a despicable fight for survival against monsters from the swamp dominet martingale has likewise constructed an arena though it is no doubt simply to entertain the guests at his many lavish galas with entertainment a little more exciting than music and wine lictor mary cul tricuspis has taken a radically different approach driving disputes between unruly guards and civilians into something more brutal and allowing the public to bear witness in hopes to promote discipline among her ranks and complacency among the populace lest they be the next one in the pits other nobles most notably the lord and lady alazarma baroness catherine and lord baron richards himself have denounced the practice as barbaric and divisive at this critical juncture though they cannot deny the silver that it brings to the colony combined warpacks from clans shattered spear and grimward hold their line in the north joined by clan whiteoak to the east though their efforts have not halted the mordok advance though the resources to do so would be comically considerable the idea has been pitched on more than one occasion to simply erect a wall between the southern clans and the dirge swamp hoping to deter the mordok with less of an active presence marquess madeline dargent has issued a call for resources to be pledged for a full expedition into the dirge swamp previous ventures into the swamp she claims failed not due to a lack of determination or purpose but a lack of supplies of equipment and most of all a lack of manpower at this time any and all donations including but not limited to supplies silver military and economic units are being accepted for the expedition which will depart with haste when sufficient resources are collectedacross the continent rumors and tales of this persistent new corruption still abound two groups in particular seem to be wholly dedicated to fighting the affliction though for very different reasons clan spiritclaw has long been devoted to rooting out corruption in all its forms and their experience and ritualistic knowledge has proved instrumental in staving off the corruption on the other side of the great wolfs hackles starkhaven has begun calling very vocally for aid in researching a more rudimentary cause for this corruption after observing it for the last few weeks seeing its persistence and diseaselike behavior the order has posited that the corruption is undead in nature not of the mordok several griffins believe the redeyed syndars claims of creating the plague are a desperate grab for attention and a way to instill fear into the hearts of the continent one group that has been notably silent in the corruption research has been the colony of newhope while the idea of opening the gates of the colony to corrupted individuals as a sanctuary has seeped into many taverns across the continent very little has been put forth by the colony to aid in the research of the corrupted a handful of deaths have been reported due to the corruption with many stemming from axhound territory representatives from the clan have tried to calm rising fears by explaining that the situation is unfortunate and they are contributing what they can to the corruption research in order to save as many lives as they can but the majority of their resources are going towards keeping the healthy residents in good condition in such circumstances the corrupted are left without sufficient supplies so that their brothers and sisters can live on similarly the first confirmed case of corruption was seen among the workers in the pass through the great wolfs hackles without proper healers on hand to help fight the sickness the workers saw fit to take matters into their own hands the corrupted individual was ceremonially put down and his body burned in a small ceremony honoring his sacrifice to prevent the spread of the corruption according to recent reports the fighting in squallborn territory has begun to lose momentum after an explosive first assault stormjarl and new aldorian ships accompanied by their allies have landed on the southern tip of squallborn lands and pushed their way north suspected to have taken between a third to a half of squallborn territory in their wake as the clan rallies to defend its remaining borders the advance of the new aldorian and stormjarl forces is slowed though much of the damage has already been done in other news to the surprise of many from in and around newhope baroness catherine has issued a public apology and statement declaring her intent to allow davens reach to continue to operate after her fervent attempts to retake the trade hub that was at one point under her control the move seems sudden though many assume it was either the heavy hand of lord baron richards or the new threat of the mordok that finally cooled her angerthe sudden reemergence of mordok activity near the great forest has long heralded the coming of spring to the ulven people a sign that the air has begun to warm itself as the snow begins to recede warpacks are traditionally organized to help patrol major routes between settlements armed and ready for combat against their ancestral foe their presence alone is often enough to deter all but the most zealous of the beasts who instead choose to pick off the occasional lone hunter or wandering merchant the battered bodies shredded armor and gruesome tales told by an increasing number of warriors from clans shattered spear and ironmound however paint a different picture one of organized attacks on heavily armed warpacks far from the normal character of the mordok numerous versions of each story have sprung into existence over the past few weeks each more fantastical than the last local chieftains have done their best to dispel or silence these accounts touting them as the fanciful tales spun by woundweary minds though the seeds of fear have been sewn word of the new corruption and highlycoordinated mordok attacks have spread throughout the continent stirring up fears among many and a sense of duty in others these alarming new developments have many eyes turned to the larger clans who are scrambling to calm the rising concerns and contain the threat others have taken a more desperate stance on the matter allowing their fear to guide their actions production in some areas of clan ironmound has slowed to a trickle as workers either fall to the mordok or leave their posts to return home and protect their families many in clan riverhead have taken to blaming the corruption on clan ironmound believing it to be divine retribution from gaia for their generations of desecration through their mines and profiteering clan axhound on the other hand has taken perhaps the most drastic action an entire village has been evacuated and refilled by those afflicted with corruption tended to by woefully understaffed healers and herbalists warpacks patrol this village claiming to be watching for mordok to protect the inhabitants although many have started to whisper that the warriors are there instead to enforce the quarantine through any means necessary reports from numerous truthseekers of clan spiritclaw have emerged detailing the eruption of a number of new corruption sites inside the great forest they are calling for action and allies doing their best to keep this vile plague at bay but know that their efforts could very well be quickly overwhelmed if there is not a concentrated effort to eradicate these hubs of corruption trouble begins to brew in nightriver territory as protests break out in a handful of small settlements though they have yet to devolve into full riots the honorbound whiteoak and grimward populations are demanding action after a disproportionate number of their groups seem to be disappearing in these mordok raids branthur has reassured them that once the threat is subdued and the resources are available he will fund an investigation into the matter but many feel he is trying to cover something up spreading stories of the strange movement of the mordok attacking their villages they show an intelligence posture and coordination out of character with their usual nature during these nighttime raids amidst this chaos marquess madeline dargent of newhope has revealed that she is in the process of planning an expedition into the dirge swamp possibly to take place sometime this year she has made it clear that the trips made in the past while vital for research and historical purposes were woefully underfunded understaffed and underequipped in the coming months she has invited factions and individuals interested in pursuing this lead to donate their time silver supplies and voice to the expedition hoping to push through the swamp for the first time in recorded history despite the turmoil facing the rest of the continent prince aylin has continued to instead push for more allies to commit to his contract though the details of which have remained elusive at best his secrecy and timing in this matter have drawn the ire and the denunciation of lord baron richards who has criticized the prince for being opportunistic and selfish in the face of the hardships facing the continent requiring unification on all sides rather than political maneuvering references to aylins father have been made as well as connections drawn to the fall of faedrun much to the infuriation of the prince and his subjects still he has remained silent about the details of the contract simply noting the wealth and glory that will come to those who sign on he has shown no signs of going back on his word to reveal the contract at the beginning of aprilas reparations begin to filter through to smaller settlements around the continent with them comes either praise or criticism for branthur nightriver and his handling of the situation many of the smaller clans such as steinjottun and goldenfield have been very vocal about their support of the treaty eager to see an end to the fighting the reparations doled out to their citizens reinforce these thoughts rewarding and recompensing them for resources and lives lost in the war rebuilding projects begin in full nearly as soon as the supplies arrive with the looming threat of grimward conquest all but extinguished by the decisive treaty championed by branthur the more neutral clans of riverhead and spiritclaw have yet to sign the treaty but have not voiced that they will not do so it is unknown what their decision will be others are far less pleased with the treaty and no less vocal about their opinions although the representative of axhound agreed to the treaty and their clan will do well with the reparations given to them the treaty does in fact mean that they lose some of their land to clan whiteoak this aspect has not been seen favorably by some of the axhound chieftains and rumor has it that their clanleader is having a hard time keeping them in check clan stormjarl has continued their tirade against the document they feel has taken too much from them new aldoria expressing their solidarity with this hardwon ally has also refused to sign the treaty word has begun to circulate of these groups being refused their reparations for their defiance while such an action could lead to a schism that costs clan nightriver two of their most substantial allies in the future only time will tell what the full consequences of the treaty will be and if further meetings and negotiations will help between the leaders of the various clans clan ironmound had been a temperamental ally during the war and their sentiment seems to remain split in times of peace many see the aid given by the coalition as a sign of a change in heart by the colonists together they stood and held back the tide of grimward and whiteoak warriors and brought the fighting on mardrun to an end others however recall the announcement that their clan had joined the coalition in a whirlwind of political faux pas and a great deal of misunderstandings rather than remaining neutral in the war as they had originally hoped regardless of their feelings towards the coalition and clan grimward there are few in clan ironmound not excited to see the influx of supplies from the reparations they are calling for allies to join them in rebuilding their homes and defenses as a way to prove to the unconvinced that the alliance they so hastily joined was more than a kneejerk reaction to grimward aggression even if rumors abound about ironmound already working deals with clans involved in both sides of the war on the other side of the war all is not well among the alliance responsible for much of the aggression while clans grimward and whiteoak had been present at the drafting of the treaty and made a show of signing it to end the fighting and conserve that which they had taken thus far their smaller ally clan squallborn has also publicly denounced the document their small size and isolated location hampered their ability to take new territory during the attacks and the reparations demanded by the treaty would affect them proportionately harder than either clan grimward or whiteoak feeling the treaty unfairly targeted them rather than the driving force behind the war clan squallborn has refused to sign with much of their territory now owned by clan grimward clan watchwolfs people are now openly divided about their future the eastern watchwolves are still upset of the conquest and want their people back and the western watchwolves have seemed to embraced their conquerors faring better now than they have in a long time this detail alone has caused more than a few people to wonder if grimwards conquest was actually so focused on bloodshed and slaughter which is what it was so vividly painted as to many people hushed talk among patrons at local taverns detail an incident that took place last month between various factionsadventurers and some soldiers from davens reach rumors vary quite a bit as to exactly what happened but word has it that percival the current leader of davens reach has decided not to retaliate against anyone over this incident and has instead punished or banished those responsible the combined efforts of several different groups appears to have swayed his decision to shape up some of his unruly men a small victory for those involved in the incident and a solid step towards the reach being viewed as a legitimate settlementto usher in the new year the colony of newhope has opened their doors to clan nightriver and members of the coalition representatives will venture into the ravens district of the city in the month of february to make their case before a clan nightriver representative to receive their share of reparations from clan grimward the possibility of many movers and shakers present will be substantial giving those also in attendance a chance to rub elbows with people they may otherwise never meet there is also rumor that leaders and members of the current coalition will be meeting to discuss the future of this group clan stormjarl has been adamantly vocal about their attitude toward this treaty decrying it as dishonorable and insulting clanleader graytir stormjarl much to the ire of branthur has sent out letters inviting members of the coalition to stand with him in defying the document retaking their homelands and seeking vengeance on clan grimward for the war crimes they committed it seems that clan stormjarl has no intention to back down from the injustice they were dealt by clan grimward and rumors spread about mercenaries and warriors finding work in the future with the clan not to be outdone prince aylin of new aldoria has also dispatched a number of hawks bearing a much more cryptic message any who are interested in his employment are invited to contact him via hawk or courier before the spring to discuss terms though he has made no real indication of his intentions at this point talk runs wild with speculation is new aldoria invading the colony of newhope is there a new construction project planned is new aldoria sending troops to fight somewhere are the marines of new aldoria leading a voyage back to faedrun nobody seems to know for certain at this time rumors have filtered through taverns and street corners of a dispute beginning to boil over between baroness catherine and the marquess madeline dargent the recent surge of activity from davens reach has prompted the baroness to once again push to retake the trade hub once in her possession the marquess though her influence has been reduced following the election of lord baron richards still holds a great deal of power over the newhope military but refuses to devote the troops to such a personal campaign the lord baron richards seems to have no priority placed on retaking davens reach some view this as a further insult to the lord barons previously biggest rival worry seems to grip a number of merchants that travel freely through the territories of mardrun the recent civil war forced numerous clans and colonies to use up a lot of supplies and food or focus attention away from the farms and fields during prime harvest time reports of settlements faring poorly and scraping by or not having the coin and trade they used to seems commonplace in the trading posts and markets around the continent clan nightriver is even rumored to be on the verge of a food crisis the recent arrival of honor bound villagers and warriors as payment from clan grimward further putting a strain on already taxed food stores while the fight is over the residual consequences of the costs of this civil war appear to be gripping numerous colonies and clanstalk of the peace treaty signed this month is on the lips of nearly everyone on mardrun some praising it for bringing an end to the war others arguing that it will simply lead to additional conflicts both are correct in a sense while the treaty did bring about peace between clans nightriver and grimward and will result in the termination of additional combat between the two largest armies already clans stormjarl and squallborn have voiced their anger with the treaty feeling left out and betrayed by those they once considered allies clan stormjarl specifically has announced that they will not sign this treaty if it remains as it is currently written they have once again put out the call for allies to stand with them to help them reclaim their lands stolen by clan grimward despite the treaty a cry of outrage from numerous diplomats and representatives has been voiced as well as the legitimacy of such a meeting to finalize a treaty and who actually had authority to speak on behalf of whom is still lacking definitive detail and threats of increased diplomatic presence by various groups seems to be on the horizon whether this agreement and the document written will continue to deescalate the ulven civil war or plunge some clans further into conflict is still unknown still there is much cause for celebration as the grimward war machine has ground to a halt due to the valiant actions of clan nightriver and the coalition as an honor debt for this massive conflict is agreed upon and paid in both materials and honor bound working hands reparations will be arriving soon to be distributed as branthur sees fit cases could be made for some of the smaller settlements to earn a piece of that deal though the final decision lies with the clanleader alone rumors are already stirring that the smaller clans will be vying for material wealth for their contributions to the civil war pressure on clan nightriver from numerous angles will most likely force branthurs hand into being overly generous with payments of restitution to his allies but only time will tell the human colonies have generally been very receptive to this new treaty eager for the chance to build trade and expand without the threat of grimward aggression plans are already in motion for the construction of additional outposts and trade roads and modest celebrations have been held in a number of venues to rejoice at the end to more major bloodshed some are wary of the repercussions such a treaty will undoubtedly carry and take stormjarls threats of rebellion against the treaty very seriously but for the most part the mood is jovial and light news continues to spread about a potential large scale contract with new aldoria beginning in the spring but the details of the contract still remain a mystery for the past several months many have noted and reported the suspicious movements of the mordok many of which had been heading north with alarming focus this month however the news turned more ominous no movement had been mentioned at all optimists are hopeful that it is simply because of the winter and possible coming storms others are less than convinced believing it to be a sign that the mordok are themselves the coming storm for now though only time will tell what the creatures will bring with them if and when they return as political turmoil begins to swell on mardrun in place of bloody combat citizens and leaders alike are looking for any way to keep spirits high and dissention low this month may well prove to be just what is needed the great wolfs hunt is rapidly approaching a holiday during which no ulven hunt saving that honor instead for the great wolf in addition word has begun to spread that a week prior to that a celebration will be held in honor of halvar steinjottun clanleader of steinjottun the clanleader eagerly anticipating his 50th year has organized a stag hunt on the night of his birthday with the hunter or warrior tasked with bringing down the beast rewarded with a seat of honor at the feast of the great wolfs huntword has spread far and wide of the recent battles fought on the front lines of the civil war haygreths forces marched to battle after feigning retreat moving in numbers unseen by the ulven branthur personally led his warriors in a seemingly reckless charge to drive them back hoping to cripple the opposing army into submission entering the battle outnumbered and unprepared the nightriver forces accompanied and supported by units from throughout the coalition stood their ground in a valiant effort particularly through the sacrifices made by those commanding the rear outpost drawing several grimward warpacks away from the front lines to their position was the nightriver counterassault a surprising victory though many lost their lives that day and many more will forever bear the scars of that battle the day was one for clan nightriver and their allies in the end haygreths forces were forced back into their own territory and beyond though with the chill of winter setting in branthur chose not to pursue them further much to the ire of some clans who wanted to crush those they had come to see as invaders once and for all branthur has remained steady in his course of action though insistent on not stretching his army too thin and allowing grimward to retaliate too effectively branthur has made it known that there will be a meeting midway through the coming month in order to begin to talk terms with grimward this is the closest thing to a resolution that has been seen since the outbreak of the civil war and should be cause for celebration though not all are excited some of the allied clans have expressed their concerns with this meeting worried that the talks will be focused on nightriver and grimward leaving those on the outskirts to their own devices and defense axhound has stated their concerns that whiteoak retaliation will pose a substantial threat to their clan stormjarl has demanded the return of their lands and have hinted at the possibility of using force to take it back if need be news of this upcoming meeting spreads quickly and has caused a surprising amount of turmoil in newhope and new aldoria rumors have begun popping up from tavern to tavern accusing this noble or that of plotting to continue the war treaty or not though many are simply bar tales designed to slander a noble with opposing political beliefs some of the rumors make decent points war is a rather lucrative business and has led to rather substantial profits for those capable of taking advantage of it in addition having bored unemployed mercenaries wandering the city streets could prove dangerous that being said the general populace is eager for an end to this war new aldoria on the other hand seems to have taken the opposite approach prince aylin has made very public his hopes for a peaceful and expedient end to this conflict despite protests from many of his merchants and mercenaries who fear that peace will bring economic stagnation prince aylin has assured them however that the end of the war will be nothing but beneficial for those loyal to new aldoria mordok activity south of the dirge swamp has continued to decline this month almost to the point of disappearance it has been weeks since hunters have stumbled across even the odd patrol of the beasts in the great forest the hunters themselves are not complaining a day with no mordok is a good day indeed the daughters in the area however tell a different story the lack of activity is a troublesome omen indeed if the mordok are not here where are they and what are they doing night guards to the north have reported a few instances of small bands of mordok sneaking back into the swamp under cover of darkness though they tend to keep their distancefighting on the front lines is intense during the first few days of the month as both sides attempt to push through before the winter sets in barechested berserkers from clan whiteoak clash against longfang shields volleys of spells are loosed by the archons standing shouldertoshoulder with daughters of gaia only to draw the response of a rain of arrows from across the line clerics bearing the blue and white of bos mezar hold their ground beside those from the order of arnaths fist meeting their opposition with a wall of steel shields and faith with their green hoods as camouflage several rangers are able to get the drop on a unit of grimward warriors as they approach the main battle setting themselves up for a fight to aid the rest of the line wood splinters and steel gleams as the combined forces of nightriver newhope and new aldoria stands firm against a wave of grimward attackers weathering the storm before returning the fury in kind with little to look forward to save the red and gold of the phoenix caravans bringing food to the camps the hungry warriors are beginning to feel the desperation of this war hoping to return soon and see and end of all this bloodshed after the previous weeks of deadly combat however there is a surprising break in the fighting troops readily seize the opportunity to rest and tend to their wounded though the leaders present remain wary and maintain their patrols shortly thereafter scouts return gasping for breath after their journey but quickly recovering enough to manage a smile news from the front lines arrives in a hurry with couriers and hawks bearing joyous news the grimward forces are in large part retreating the final push before the coming winter seems to have been a success giving coalition forces a muchneeded chance to rest and recover a number of whiteoak and grimward warpacks remain in the area however and are still cause for concern to those stationed on the vanguard a general unease settles over much of the main force as they press the retreat coming across a multitude of grimward camps all but abandoned tents are left standing coals still warm in fire pits the occasional bit of food or clothing left scattered about clan shattered spear eager to return home has sent word through the many units stationed on or near their territory that the would be willing to discuss terms with any who are willing to hold their lines for the winter many among nightriver have expressed a degree of disgust with such offers insisting that shattered spear warriors should defend their own homes not hire the work out to others tensions have been building in shared camps and though neither side has been dissuaded from their points these arguments have not escalated beyond words as news of the retreat reaches newhope a cry of excitement can nearly be heard blocks away from its source martingale manor quickly fliers are posted and distributed around the bustling city inviting one and all to a gala to be held in honor of the brave men and women who fought to bring this bloody mess to an end near the end of the winter many lowerclass citizens however have taken to the streets in what have as of yet remained nonviolent protests decrying the wasteful manner of these parties especially during a time of such need the downtrodden in particular have not forgotten about the food shortage facing newhope despite the aid given by the ravens and their agents in the city drastic measures may be taken they warn if these goods to keep the city from starving are squandered on an obscenely extravagant party to appease the whims of the wealthiest citizens martingale and other nobles have responded insisting that the supplies they have received will be more than enough to last the winter and that such an event will be good for morale and lead to higher yields in the months after the spring thaw concerns remain judging by shortages from previous years and more support would definitely be welcomed though the citys stores seem to be holding up thus far despite being an early and reliable ally in the war clan axhound has remained fairly quiet this month with fewer reports trickling in regarding their current situation with clan whiteoak the lack of information has many leaders worried although branthur has stepped in on a multitude of occasions to ease those concerns assuring people that the nature of their relationship with clan whiteoak has likely caused them to be spending more time and effort on the war rather than on their allies and he feels it would be safe to assume the fighting has been dying down on that front as well hopefully leading to axhound returning to the war as a whole shortly hushed whispers have been spreading throughout the front lines following in branthurs wake many warriors claim to have seen kragen bloodmoon himself warleader of clan nightriver in custody the reasoning for this has yet to be divined although the frequency of these rumors lends credence to the story kragens personal warpack seems to have gone missing although additional rumors claim they were branded and sent north to the dirge swamp to atone for whatever misdeeds could have led to such a harsh punishment with their lives worry spreads among the camp although branthur has announced plans to address the group as a whole when the time is right he has requested the presence of a multitude of clans for the announcement and rumor has it that even clan grimwards presence has been requested the truthseekers of clan spiritclaw have been hard at work attempting to locate any and all lorespeakers they may be able to find though their resources are stretched thin many packs have begun offering rewards for information that leads to the apprehension of a lorespeaker more for the capture of one alive they insist that they mean to question those they find although rumors of vigilante justice among other clans have led to some concern about spiritclaws true intentions clan stormjarl thirsty for vengeance for their fallen brothers and sisters is eager to push into grimward territory taking advantage of the situation they claim could set grimward back on their heels enough to force them to surrender if they cannot withstand the winter stormjarl will be hard pressed to inflict any significant damage on clan grimward at this time due to their reduced numbers but have been emboldened by the effectiveness of their tactics to remove any strategic value from the lands they once called home grimwardcontrolled villages once in stormjarl territory have had their fields salted their crops burned and their walls sabotaged making them more trouble to hold than they are worth this has led to the vast tract of land spanning between stormjarl and grimward colloquially known to stormjarl as haygreths scar a region of barren fields charred remains of buildings and an eerie quiet more deafening than the battles that led to its inception clan ironmound however has seen enough blood shed for this year and is insisting that the coalition remains in place bolstering defenses in preparation for the spring thaw which will inevitably bring more fighting and have been calling for warriors and laborers alike both to hold the lines and begin construction on additional buildings in the area as the soldiers and warriors take full advantage of their small vacation from the fighting their leaders remain unconvinced while some are using this opportunity to build morale among their troops others insist they remain vigilant grimwards retreat seemed too hasty and premature until that day comes however time will only tell what the future holds for the coalitionworry spreads in hushed tones across the continent this month as both sides in the civil war see a dramatic increase in aggression especially near the pass through the great wolfs hackles in a largescale push to wound their opponent before the chill of winter forces them to stay their hand branthur nightriver has once again put out the call for any and all who reside on his land to do their part to ensure a swift victory several of his warpacks accompanied by those of his allies and the units sent by the coalition and colony armies have been able to make a solid push into grimward territory this month though the offensive has left them less able to defend some key positions an opportunity that grimward has seized with haste momentum has built on both sides each refusing to back down even a handful of lions from the order of arnaths fist along with a unit of militiamen bearing the mark of starkhaven have come forward offering their skills both on and off the battlefield their resolve strengthened by the support gathered by the coalition the entire border that clan grimward shares with clans ironmound and shattered spear has become a war zone often erupting into small hitandrun attacks fullscale decisive battles have yet to rage though the pressure building in the region surely means that it will not be long before they do several villages are raided on both sides of the war each side eager to lash out at their enemy the fighting is not confined to the ironmound shattered spear and grimward borders however increased aggression from both clan whiteoak and clan axhound has been reported both seizing an opportunity to harm their ancestral foe ships bearing the emblem of clan squallborn have been spotted in increasing number along the coasts though the small clans territory itself has remained mostly quiet by order of graytir stormjarl warpacks have begun to retake their homeland in a bold maneuver opting to burn the buildings and crops to the ground rather than attempt to weather the storm of grimward invasion this has led to a long swath of land being rendered unusable in the hopes that grimward will be unable to use the land they have conquered the massive movement spurred by the war is unrivaled in ulven recorded history both of warriors marching to the front lines and civilians evacuating their homes which are no longer safe clans grimward and ironmound along with their longfang allies released a number of documents recovered from a lorespeaker cache deep in the dirge swamp recently turning the concept of ulven honor on its head the documents  which seem to indicate that not only was it not taboo for ulven to kill each other generations ago it was not even uncommon  have helped to justify the bloodshed to some of the more eager warriors no longer fearful of the dishonor they may face in the next life many however still cling to the ways they were taught ready to defend their homes to the death but uneasy about killing their own kind the killing of their brothers and sisters was bad enough when it was kept to small border skirmishes but now clans march to a war the likes of which has not been seen in generations if these documents are to be trusted without a solid effort to remove the invaders from the coastal nightriver villages warriors from clan whiteoak have been able to establish a foothold in unfriendly territory with the bulk of nightrivers forces focusing on the front lines of the war the berserkers have been able to raid and pillage virtually unopposed a number of chieftains in the area have urged branthur to either help them or find someone who will such a task will surely not be as easy as it may sound however as reports have surfaced that the squallborn ships which originally deposited the troops on nightriver soil have remained in the area as well a number of lorespeakers has already been captured and turned over to cahal spiritclaw and branthur nightriver who have set about the delicate task of learning the truth from those who have proven themselves liars the will of the lorespeakers already captured seems to be stronger than anticipated however and efforts to extract information from them have proven relatively futile thus far threats of violence shame and even death seem not to faze the captives as they would a normal ulven branthur has continued to offer rewards for the capture of any living lorespeakers however hoping that one of them will reveal the true depths of their deception in due time many ulven feel betrayed by these supposed historians who appear to have willfully deceived the ulven people for generations about their true history as a result vigilante justice continues to pop up in some of the more remote locations of mardrun the perpetrators eager to have their sense of vengeance appeased this anger justified or otherwise has begun to spill over into other groups however a handful of reports indicate that a number of truthseekers have gone missing in the past weeks with others voicing their disapproval of the groups inability to discover a lie of these proportions newhope continues to struggle to maintain their level of involvement in the war eager to not be outdone by new aldoria while they have communicated with branthur and respectfully scaled back their shipments of food and supplies many in the colony fear it will not be enough lord baron richards has swallowed his pride and put out a call for help asking other settlements to pledge supplies for newhope so the colony can survive the winter if insufficient resources are gathered or promised the colony will need to drastically reduce their involvement at this critical point in time reports of mordok acting strangely around the great forest continue drawing the attention of several packs among the nearby clans ever the cunning predators the mordok have been eschewing their normal ways and completely avoiding all combat with the ulven focusing instead on their task at hand almost as if with a singular mind the mordok continue their exodus with relentless drive towards their goal north a letter hand delivered by a young ulven dressed in brown with accents of the blue and black of nightriver arrives at each of the major settlements inside nightriver territory others in more distant locales receive a hawk bearing the same message to my allies friends and brothers among the coalition the time has come for us to end this war recently i made it known that if you were to continue to live on my land you would contribute to the fight and you have done well in that regard now i must ask you once again to dig deep into your stores your coffers and your barracks for one final assault before the winter comes this coming month will be the most crucial to date we must strike as deep as we are able into the grimward war machine before the winter sets in in doing so grimward will be forced to retreat and lick their many wounds while trying to survive the colder months with any luck they will soon realize the error of their ways and sue for peace an outcome we can all revel in if you have troops send them if you have food send it if you can afford mercenaries and sellswords send them as well any and all resources can be used and your involvement will be rewarded once the day is ours the ulven way is to run towards our problems not away from them that is precisely what we will do and may the great wolfs ears ring with our names before the day is through fight with honor brothers branthur nightriver clanleader of clan nightriverthe coalition army has been able to clear the pass and has connected with ironmound forces to form a northern front along the southern border of clan ironmounds lands grimward forces have responded with increased aggression along the entirety of the line what had in the past been sporadic attacks by individual units have become have become more complex and coordinated with the goal of forcing gaps in the line which are quickly taken advantage of by forces held in reserve although the last of the coalition carts in the pass was able to escape the bandit force and deliver its supplies through the aid of nearby adventurers the combined leadership on the northern front recognize that their local stockpiles will be insufficient to last until snowfall the local leadership have called on any who are able to provide help in procuring transporting and protecting supplies for this front two warpacks from clan whiteoak have covertly landed on clan nightrivers shores with the help of squalborn ships these warpacks have already burned a small fishing village but did not kill the inhabitants farmers in the vicinity have been overheard planning an early harvest stating that it is better to reap the crop before its time then to risk it being burnt in the field as of yet there has been no plan on how to deal with coastal attacks by clan nightrivers enemies with all of the commotion elsewhere in their territory a frightening occurrence goes mostly overlooked within the confines of clan nightrivers lands the remains of a third squallborn ship made ground this one a few miles west of crows landing bearing no survivors and many scars from a fierce battle those who investigated the wreckage related vicious lacerations infected wounds and scorch marks on both of the corpses found lashed upside down to the wreckage daughters of gaia from clan riverhead have drawn the ire of the leadership of clan goldenfield stirring the fears of many farmers in the area the daughters claim that the blight which impeded goldenfields harvest last month was retribution from gaia herself seeking to punish her children who had strayed from her path ever the gracious and loving mother she would not be as cruel as to outright kill her children but by limiting their food supply she would remind them of their place the clanleader of goldenfield has reassured branthur that he has no intention of removing his clan from the alliance despite what their neighbors daughters may claim reports of lone mordok sightings have started to trickle in from clans bordering the great forest none of these reports would be of interest separately as mordok are not uncommon in the area all of these reports mention that without fail each of the individuals are headed north with some haste some reports note that the mordok have failed to attack even the unarmed hope surges within clan stormjarl as an entire village is freed from the yoke of grimward occupation a handful of hunters working behind enemy lines and allies that landed on the shore to assist them were able to defeat the guards keeping the village under control as a work camp and escort them to safety these villagers and warriors were transported along the coast to safety in stormjarl villages who are already crowded but willing to shoulder the burden to see some of their own returned to them news reaches the villagers less than a week after they make landfall that the grimward solders they left alive decided to burn the village rather than be forced to stand guard over empty houses and fields following the release of many documents detailing the true history of the ulven people a joint effort between clans nightriver and spiritclaw has been formed seeking any information regarding the lorespeakers rewards have been offered by both clans for information leading to the discovery of these traitors with substantially larger rewards for their capture assuming they are kept alive a number of smaller packs namely among shattered spear have taken matters into their own hands branding and severing any lorespeakers they come across in the fervor to press for a swift and decisive victory over clan grimward in the pass the colony of newhopes clerks seem to have overlooked their current inventories afraid of the repercussions of the war front losing supplies the colony has put out a call to the smaller settlements in the area asking them to dig deep and send whatever can be spared for the war effort as the colony will soon need to address the issue of its dwindling storehouses as the civil war increases in intensity the need to feed and supply troops in the field could be one of the most critical points of this conflictnews regarding the war on all fronts spreads quickly through the major settlements of the coalition with the majority telling of great deeds in the pass accompanied by several nightriver warpacks coalition forces have managed to continually drive grimward backwards although the pass has not been taken such a relentless assault will likely force grimward to either abandon their position or divert additional resources away from the rest of the war to combat the problem as allied troops continue their push through the pass the importance of pressing the advantage and breaking through is now even more obvious some fear that if the soldiers and warriors in the pass cannot reach their clan ironmound and clan shattered spear allies it could drastically change the rest of the fighting soldiers need food and supplies each month and stalling out the fighting could force the coalition and its allies to use up more supplies than first anticipated grimward now fully finished with conquering the watchwolf territories has begun its offensive in earnest against clan shattered spear and clan ironmound small border skirmishes have been reported in numerous areas while the continent focuses on the pass and the battles near ironmound some worry about the other grimward allies to the east very little has been reported on the larger dealings of clan whiteoak and clan squallborn or what they have been up to the market fair which recently took place in crows landing also drummed up quite a few rumors through loose lips a great deal of the continent now knows of the plan to formalize the coalition although feelings are mixed some see it as a great opportunity to bring the separate groups together for a single cause others see it as an affront to their freedoms or the first steps of a plan for dominance whatever the public opinion the leaders of the coalition are eager to see the draft of such a contract presented that they might make an informed decision moving forward it is unknown at this time what the coalition will formerly be as en entity or what kind of power it will yield on the larger political scale a number of hawks from clan stormjarl arrive in the more prominent settlements of the coalition reminding their leaders that the offer of wealth in exchange for assistance in regaining their homeland and their honor from the clutches of clan grimward still stands they insist that ironmound has plenty of troops to hold their own lines which they have not lost yet whereas stormjarl will require greater support to reclaim what was theirs this message mirrors one from last year when clan stormjarl reached out offering wealth to those who would ally themselves with them word from clan shattered spear comes to branthur nightriver informing him that relationships with clan riverhead have been strained as of late though they have avoided giving precise reasoning laifnar icefury seems to be under the impression that the very traditional priestesses of clan riverhead are beginning to grow weary of the presence of the colonists and are annoyed by nightrivers continued support of these outsiders they have shown no indications of taking a side in the war nor have they expressed any open hostility towards the coalition or their allies as a whole but the reception of travelers and refugees has been much colder than it had been in the past and some reports have come through where tense situations and even violence has taken place between colonists and the local clan riverhead packs this could become a large issue soon as the path around the great wolfs hackles back to clan nightriver territory travels directly through clan riverhead lands panic sets in amongst the villagers of a small settlement of clan goldenfield their crop which they had been preparing to harvest next month has begun to wither and die leading to starvation of their livestock and a strain to their workers the source of this blight is unknown but their daughters are hard at work to cleanse the land this will unfortunately result in fewer supplies available to the coalition in the coming months unless a concentrated effort is made to assist them the clanleader has not yet reached out for aid so it is unknown if the blight is small enough to be contained or if pride is getting in the way of the clans leadership sending a call for aid gustav ironmound clanleader of clan ironmound has made it known that after his clans expedition into the dirge swamp he has acquired a number of old ulven texts that he intends to share with the other clans he has no intention of hiding these texts or keeping them from the ulven people as a whole and apparently takes great pleasure in making sure it is known that representatives from his clan had the honor of leading this expedition with the support of both sides of the war daughters bearing copies of the texts have begun traveling to numerous locations and freely share this information with others deep concern and confusion begins to set in with some of the ulven people as the content of the texts is unsettling and questions many details of their history as a people whether this is a show of bravado and personal honor or a piece of some sort of larger plan is unknown at this time but the impact of these texts being made public begins to travel like wildfire through the ulven peoplethe leadership of lord baron richards has been surprisingly smooth under his command many troops and many more loads of supplies have been sent or promised to nightriver and the warfront an act which would have been horrifically time consuming in the bureaucratic old system many are optimistic for the city hoping it will flourish under a single strong leader the new leader of davens reach has been visibly trying to extend his influence a problem that many of the colonists and ulven had hoped would be resolved by now but lack the resources to fix wanted posters have sprung up in many of the nearby settlements although his agents have occasionally replaced these posters with their own mockeries often depicting lord baron richards or prince aylin as thieves instead if whispers around the local taverns are any indication his ideals may be gathering support rallying others to his cause letters from the new leadership of clan watchwolf have been delivered to clan nightriver describing the treatment they have received at the hands of their grimward conquerors food has been distributed families have not been uprooted and have been given time to grieve for their fallen before being enlisted by the grimward war front the end of the letter encourages nightriver to reconsider their stance on the war as life under grimward rule has been better than it was during the war clans ironmound and shattered spear have vocally entered an agreement to protect each others borders should grimward take their land during the fighting this could be a huge step in solidifying the tenuous alliance with clan ironmound as it is the first true pledge to aid in the war rather than simply withstand it mordok activity near the edge of the dirge swamp was brutal again this month with the creatures seemingly driven into a frenzy by something these attacks on clan shattered spear could prove costly and force them to redistribute forces away from the front lines clan whiteoak also received their share of attention drawing warriors away from their rivalry and allowing clan axhound the chance to perform a number of opportunistic raids coalition reinforcements have been a large deterrent for grimward aggression in the pass making their warpacks think twice about trying to take that territory and making them pay for every inch in blood well over a hundred wellrested warriors from clan nightriver have arrived at the pass accompanied by several dozen soldiers from both newhope and new aldoria and multiple wagons full of food bandages and weapons for the war effort thanks in large part to campaigns executed by smaller factions giving and asking for aid in the war the supplies alone have helped revitalize the troops stationed there and the veritable army present could soon be a major issue for clan grimward parts of newhope were in an uproar late this month as dominet martingale hosted yet another elaborate party as the chambers emptied however guards noticed that martingale was nowhere to be found half the city was searched much to the ire of many civilians until the man was eventually found passed out and hung over in a stable nearby letters from branthur nightriver arrive at many notable locations among coalition settlements the letters issue a strongly worded reminder that many of the colonists are residing on his land and their honor is being called upon to make possibly the last push against grimward with clan ironmound on their side clan nightriver has a strong chance to push into the heart of grimward territory though their enemy is expected to strike back viciously so troops will be needed to secure the borders of clans shattered spear stormjarl and ironmound rumors have spread like wildfire of the recent expedition into the dirge swamp despite the war ironmound grimward and coalition forces put aside their differences to reveal some secrets of the ulven people many documents written in the old ulven text were discovered on the trip with the originals leaving with grimward and translated copies finding their way into the hands of the coalition the true meaning of these documents has yet to be determined and those in their possession have critical decisions ahead of thema large celebration was held in the colony of newhope as baron richards is voted in as the single leader of the colony rumors spread like wildfire that seem to point at the baron using a fair amount of resources securing allies within the colonies other candidates such as baroness catherine who was close in the running failed to acquire the political backing and settlement support needed to pull forward to win the vote the colonists eagerly await the new direction of the now properly titled lord baron richards merchants on the road tell stories of a boisterous leader a former oarsmeet pirate rallying smaller groups and coordinating banditry out of davens reach after baroness catherine was unable to retake her property and her hired ulven warrior allies were repelled for several months a clear message was given to all of those looking to oppose the colonies join us in rebellion take what you want to survive and oppose those that would rule you drifters and unemployed mercenaries flock to the reach in search of opportunity this haven of banditry if left unchecked could become a major concern in the future mordok activity near the dirgeswamp spiked heavily this month with merchants telling of larger and more organized raids by mordok rumors and fears spread at what the mordok are up to as the change over the last two years in the mordok has been noticed by the northern most villages and the defending war packs of clan shattered spear and clan whiteoak recent activity near onsallas village the settlement of pack longfang has caused even more rumors to soar as a strange ulven artifact was used by members of the coalition to dig up something long buried in the swamp news of this has reached many ears and whispers abound about what it could be and who might be interested in it after months of successful counterraids against grimward held positions in conquered stormjarl territory the warriors of clan stormjarl and their supporting allies have slowed their campaign down there is now what appears to be a solid buffer between occupied grimward territory and the stormjarl defensive line now separates the two opposing clans wagons loaded with dried goods and materials were brought back to the stormjarl settlement denying grimward access to them in the future it is suspected that clan stormjarl will continue to strip its occupied territories of usable goods to deny them to their enemies after making several stops and acquiring some additional supplies the caravan that left the colony has reportedly reached the great wolfs hackles traveling through the mountains the caravan had reached the northern half of the pass when they encountered the vandregonian units in a skirmish with grimward war packs the caravan entered into a small skirmish with the grimward warriors focusing on defense and repelled the initial attack the newhope caravan was able to rally a defensive line and protect their wagons but it is suspected that without additional troops it will be hard to make progress any further through the hackles as the caravan established an area to make a semipermanent camp five war packs of clan nightriver and their supply wagons reached their position morale soars as almost 150 nightriver warriors reach the defensive line in the pass grimward war packs have retreated to the more defendable positions in the pass and it is unknown if they will attempt to hold out and delay the allied caravans moving through the mountains a second caravan is being coordinated in newhope with mercenaries and watch members leaving soon to the pass two small mercenary companies of several dozen warriors and one unit of colony watch soldiers with a small supply wagon are departing soon to follow baron richards men and the clan nightriver war packs going through the pass prince aylin of new aldoria is also pledging a unit of new aldorian footmen and has released a large stockpile of supplies to be used for the war effort this caravan is due to leave for the pass in june clan ironmound has begun to mobilize war packs and move them to their western border in an attempt to prepare against the grimward invasion several communities and settlements have begun erecting defensive walls and stockpiling supplies in their mountain storehouses war packs on the northern edge of ironmound territory collaborate with clan shattered spear war packs allowing for mutual defense and assistance to each others territories some of the members of the coalition have pledged aid or begun to move their troops to the area but some fear that if grimward presses they could take advantage of the lack of a cohesive defense several war packs have already sent messages back stating that grimward warriors have been seen moving towards outlying settlements in what appears to be a preparation for upcoming raids many fear that if clan nightriver and the coalition fail to mobilize fast enough clan ironmound may withdraw its allegiancethe colony of newhope continued to be a flurry of activity as the election for the future leader of the colony took place noble estates were host to many colonists coming to cast their vote and colony watch guards were everywhere making sure the election remained peaceful the winner will be chosen amongst members of the council of ten and will be released next month in may rumors already are spreading as to who will win this monumental election and what agendas they will push for in the future nobles continue to gossip about who would be in the running apparently instigated by some of the council members themselves a large caravan was seen leaving the colony flying the banners of baron richards and lord baron montesque the recent efforts of the coalition and reports from some of their representatives have spurred on some of the council to become more involved in the war wagons loaded down with months worth of food and supplies along with two units of veteran soldiers are headed to the pass of the great wolfs hackles with the intent of helping bolster defenses there news has reached a number of taverns about a good sized fight taking place at davens reach baroness catherine has hired some ulven warriors and is making an attempt to take it back from the brigands who seized the property the makeshift defenses of the reach have held out forcing the attackers back by the end of the month some worry that news of this reaching the colony could have hurt baroness catherines clout in the election her inability to remove a handful of brigands from her merchant outpost a sign of weakness for the potential future colony leader raids and attacks continue to take place all around the continent stormjarl continues to press north into some of their lands lost previously to grimward conquerors axhound and whiteoak continue to conduct raids on each others lands and squallborn ships are seen sailing in to reinforce and bolster the blockade between stormjarl and nightriver news finally reaches the colonies and other clans the western watchwolves of luna have surrendered to clan grimward after last months devastating blow to the defenses of the settlement and the deaths of hundreds of warriors and villagers the high priestess anjan ravensmark called for negotiations of surrender the high priestess was captured and the bloodied battered and proud watchwolves finally surrendered and gave the settlement to clan grimward grimward warriors took numerous captives and honor bound them into service but many watchwolves were treated fairly and wounded were tended to clan grimwards lands and territories now include the western watchwolves of luna survivors and refugees reach the eastern watchwolves of sol whose lands are now overflowing with new mouths to feed chieftains attempt to work together to maintain order and will try to choose a new clanleader and high priestess soon for now the watchwolf clan is effectively defeated and make it known to all that their priority is now their own people they remove themselves from the civil war ending their allegiance with clan nightriver the territory of clan ironmound was host to a feast held this month on neutral ground where representatives of clan grimward clan nightriver and the coalition were invited to discuss matters of the civil war a council of elders was chosen from some of the advisors to the clanleader to oversee the feast and gather as much information as they could about both sides a large number of factions of the coalition were present giving ironmound a chance to have many conversations with them and learn more about the culture and activities of the colony wargah grimward daughter of haygreth grimward was attending the negotiations in person on behalf of clan grimward and their allies after hours of peaceful talks the council of elders were fractured as they became swept up in the moment of forcing a decision soon in the civil war after a heated argument steel was drawn and the elders were split the procoalition elder asking for their potential new allies to stand with them and the progrimward ally agreeing to being recalled away with magic by wargah before violence could erupt the grimward guards remaining were attacked shattering the neutral ground of the feast but quickly stopped before any lives were lost worried that the several clan grimward war packs camped outside the feasting hall would retaliate the remaining elders and their followers were escorted by the coalition to a nearby village those present rejoiced in earning such a critical ally in the civil war as the council of elders were given full authority by the clanleader of ironmound to make decisions on behalf of the clan  but whispers between the remaining elders and their worried glances between them prove that their decision may have been made in haste and they fear the consequences soon after the activities die down and the elders reach the main ironmound settlement messenger hawks are seen flying from the settlement to numerous clans and colonies to the south rumor has it that the clanleader is unhappy and will be making forceful demands on the coalition and nightriver to secure his allegiance in the civil war grimward troops are seen rushing to the great wolfs hackles spurred on after the events of the ironmound feast and make a concentrated effort on the northern mouth of the pass this attack was well planned out and surprising grimwards fresh and well equipped troops hitting the pass as the defenders stationed there were weakened by months of activity and lack of food coalition defenders hold out this month but the fighting is brutal and intense without future aid grimward will most likely be able to gain a complete foothold in the pass the representative to nightriver returned from the dinner with grave news she fears that the interference of the coalition on ironmounds decision could potentially cost them an ally and rumors spread that branthur nightrivers hand will soon be forced in the involvement of the fighting of the war with ironmound wanting for so long to remain neutral advisors to the branthur fear that they will make stern demands for immediate support in order to remain an ally kragen bloodmoon warleader of nightriver mobilizes several war packs and begins marching them to the pass of the great wolfs hackles as messenger hawks are received from ironmound territorythe colony of newhope has sprung to life this past month talk of the election to decide upon a single leader has caused a bit of a rift between supporters of baroness catherine who is seen as the more compassionate choice by her supporters and those of baron richards who see their candidate as a strongwilled leader the council is split as are the people and it is likely that the happenings of upcoming months could sway votes in one direction or the other clan nightriver has begun sending out hawks arriving quickly to the leaders of many of the groups of the coalition a dinner is to be held in ironmound territory in order to decide once and for all where said clans allegiance will lie in this war clan ironmound would be an invaluable ally in the war as they hold a highly defensible location and have the ability and the knowledge to mine and work the highest quality steel found on mardrun nightriver is seeking attendees who might best represent their interests and hopefully sway the council which governs ironmound rumors of a small band of mordok roaming the great forest have once again emerged some even claim that the dozen or so of the black beasts were able to decimate a riverhead warpack although riverhead refuses to validate this story or even acknowledge the bands presence a steinjotunn warpack itching for battle and glory departs into the forest to put an end to the rumors one way or another clan axhound the most recent ally in the war against grimward has reported increased aggression along their northern border with clan whiteoak although they attribute this to the spring thaw several reports seemed odd however making a point to note that there have been very few sightings of whiteoak daughters of gaia near the battles even behind the lines the lions of arnaths fist after abandoning their post in the pass through the wolfs hackles have decided to once again try their hand at requesting aid they are in dire need of help to get their keep back into operational condition be it bodies supplies or silver at the moment they cannot promise a return on the investment save the knowledge that arnath will watch over those who protect his pride news spreads like wildfire throughout the continent grimward has taken the watchwolf western settlement many defenders fought valiantly assisted by the honor supplies and superior armor of vandregon gripping to their weapons until their dying breath inflicting a significant amount of damage to the grimward war machine others escorted the refugees to safely reach the eastern settlement still more devoted to their sacred charge laid down their weapons in order to remain in their homes now honorbound to clan grimward a shadow in the fog has been sighted along the shore of a number of coastal settlements most notably the fire isle of the phoenix enclave and keys crossing of the mardrun trading consortium too tall and oddly shaped for an ulven longship and with all ships belonging to the colonists being accounted for the ghost ship has many sailors uneasy about taking to the sea this month duke joakim ventrini made no effort to hide his trip into clan steinjotunn territory this past month almost seeming to announce his presence various sources report various reasons some say he needed some fresh air to think about the upcoming election while others posit that he was an ambassador of good will attempting to sway the clan into the coalition while his true intentions may not be known his whereabouts most certainly werethe first quarter political meetings took place at an estate in the colony of newhope as delegates and representatives from all over attended to discuss numerous details although talks of security contracts and trade took place the matter of the civil war was much less of a topic to some of the council the colonies and their allies seem content in staying a bit removed from the civil war which could be seen as a burden to the alliance made with their allies and hosts clan nightriver but unless the civil war pushes into nightriver territory then some say the colonies are much less likely to get involved without a unified rally to do so a letter read during the recent newhope colony political dinner informed the colonies that the lions of arnaths fist would be leaving the pass through the wolfs hackles at the end of the month the lack of supplies and support they received from their allies in addition to their political support from within newhope being pulled a matter of months ago led to the decision to return to starkhaven to harvest food and supplies for the families they encouraged the coalition to find someone to replace them in the pass soon before grimward takes notice of their absence and overruns the pass talk was made to send support but it seems to be too little too late to keep the order involved in the fight any longer banditry has plateaued in the area around davens reach some speculate that this means the bandits in the town have left while most assume it is because the bandits are settling in and getting comfortable in their new home which has many nearby civilians concerned rumors that baroness catherine will be making a push to take the settlement back have emerged although no troops have been moved as of yet and it is speculated that she is seeking a contract without outside help to deal with her lost investment the colonies and settlements are abuzz with rumors of baron richards bid for control spreading like wildfire word of the other interactions among council members and faction leaders have trickled through as well though none have struck such a chord as richards proclamation the city seems to have started dividing itself between the two main contenders for the position of leader of newhope baron richards and baroness catherine arguments have emerged over what catherines appearance at the dinner signifies either a show of power or a sign of desperation for now that is up to speculation clan ironmound continues to be torn in their decision in the war clan grimward has presented a much stronger case thus far although their brutality when dealing with neutral clans in the past serves as a detriment to their case with their hand being forced by the end of the month clan ironmound hopes for assistance in making their decision and possibly in dealing with the repercussions clan nightriver has been sending representatives and recently clan spiritclaw has as well to discuss with their leaders but without some sort of backing or a plan to support ironmound should they choose to oppose grimward they fear the answer is clear the blockade of clan stormjarl continues hindering the movement of supplies and troops in the war a handful of viknar longships have taken to the sea in hopes to push through and break the blockade opening up trade lines by sea again but no real direct action against either side has yet to take place besides a few smaller skirmishes at sea for the remainder of the winter clan stormjarl seems to be waiting out the blockade for potential ally support in the spring clan squallborn has been strangely aloof to any kind of contact with the other clans but it is suspected that sailing that many ships in the winter must be a major drain to their supplies clan watchwolf begins to evacuate civilians from their border villages after much persuasion from neighboring clans and allies but pressure from their own leadership and ambassadors urges them to stay and maintain their sacred charge their warriors stalwart in defense of this purpose are preparing for a bloody stand against the grimward war machine clan shattered spear and clan nightriver have expressed concern about this situation and attempt to urge the watchwolf clan leaders to see reason and coordinate a mass exodus of its people to their eastern settlement several coalition units and allies traveling near their settlement report a dire situation as food is running out and most of the settlement is being forced into war parties mordok activity in numerous territories continue to be reported as rumors of still odd happenings going on in the great forest along with other sightings a large group of mordok emerged from the dirge recently and struck the nearby village of onsallas before being repelled and disappearing into the swamp this amount of aggression and coordination is uncommon for the dead of winter numerous clans seem to be amidst an escalation in arming warriors more training and coordination of supply lines all across the continent clan whiteoak and clan axhound seem poised to strike at each other come the spring thaw and clan stormjarl has made their intent known to retaliate again against their grimward conquerors and break the clan squallborn blockade separating them from their allies clan nightriver has secured allies to defend their waters and control the pass clan grimwards mobilization of a large army to be unleashed on the remaining watchwolf defenders looms in the near future with the spring comes the impending threat and promise of battle all across mardrunnew aldoria has been the talk of the town for several months now their actions deemed good or bad depending on your source soldiers wearing the blue and green of new aldorias army were recently seen eradicating the settlement of new oarsmeet despite calls for aid from the residents therein a large number of refugees have flooded the city although they seem to be well stocked and prepared for winter even in the face of this drastic population increase prince aylin as always remains calm and collected in his public outings appearing as confident and calculating to his supporters while those who dislike him see him as aloof and pompous in his dealings with the populace whether this confidence stems from his recent actions or those to come is impossible to say the colony of newhope at least on the surface seems to be less prepared for the refugees they have taken in food while available is short in many less affluent sections of the city dominet martingale a sitting member on the council of ten drew the ire of many citizens during his annual celebration of the new year a party oozing with opulence and seen by many as a waste of resources though far from out of character with his past actions questions about the colonys safety have arisen as the guard has noted a small increase in violent crimes including the murder of a well known shipwright employed to help construct a navy for the city though details are limited regarding the crime rumors abound and have interfered with the local investigation clan watchwolf once again pleads for aid from their allies hoping to prepare for another push from grimward in the spring the letters remind the coalition of their long relationship with the watchwolves and mention a lack of supplies from the eastern settlement which were supposed to arrive earlier this month reports say that clan grimward has moved a large amount of food and supplies to their northern villages and that a large number of warriors are currently waiting out the winter in those same villages while scared reports of hunters and farmers overestimate it to being thousands of warriors realistic numbers put them possibly at being several hundred strong the clan knows that should grimward push before the watchwolves are reinforced they will almost surely be devastated in the battle concern from the clan nightriver war pack currently stationed in watchwolf territory is that they are running out of food and that they currently show no intention of abandoning their settlement due to their intense pride in maintaining the clans sacred spiritual charge hawks arrive to all of the clans and the human settlement laifnar icefury has been named the new clanleader of clan shattered spear with his title comes a more progressive look at the future solidifying clan shattered spears alliance with clan nightriver and the coalition the warriors of stormjarl after a successful initial push were unable to make any more significant progress into grimward territory due to a lack of supplies and reinforcements they continue to offer payment in exchange for warriors willing to assist them or even defend their homes the few letters that have gotten through also request aid in the form of reopening supply lines either by land or by sea as grimward controls many of the roads leading into stormjarl territory and the squallborn blockade while not completely effective as stormjarl ships respond aggressively has slowed the supply of food and troops by sea to a trickle their plan to push back against grimward to give themselves a buffer zone to defend should their enemy press them again was not as successful as they had hoped and a solid effort by grimward will seriously endanger the lives of many stormjarl citizens continued fortification of settlement defenses continues but slows down with the onset of winter a letter arrives to many key figures among the colonists and their supporters clan ironmound finds itself in a position akin to stormjarls last year clan grimward is on their doorstep demanding they choose a side in the war after witnessing the near destruction of the much larger clan stormjarl the ironmound letter explains that the clan while they would prefer to remain neutral will do what it must to ensure the survival of its people this will likely mean siding with clan grimward unless they receive sufficient help to defend their homeland clan nightriver focuses on their borders and settling in for the winter but has been attempting to negotiate with the colonists for plans in the spring the warleader has been training troops and the stormjarl refugees given homes in numerous villages and settlements but it is obvious that grimwards conquest will begin again in the spring nightriver says they have sent some representatives to clan ironmound but a hawk was sent back after they found out clan grimward reps were there as well no violence has erupted but it seems both sides are attempting to sway ironmound with grimward definitely in the lead the eastern conflict between whiteoak and axhound has seemed to slow down considerably with the onset of winter axhound rich from spoils raided from numerous villages and now the conqueror of one of the southern settlements has funneled these supplies back to axhound territory clan whiteoak warriors seem to have returned home from the larger conflict out west which could mean they intend to retaliate heavily against their hated neighbor nearby the other clans such as steinjottun and goldenfield prepare for winter after sending their aid and supplies to the war effort earlier in the fall rumors spread about the mordok presence in the great forest being much worse than initially feared as survivors of mordok attacks return to their settlements some allied ulven from several packs return home saying that the mordok were led by a group of humans although this is cast aside as nonsense this does follow a number of reports of the colonists meddling with the mordok and their corruption in the dirge swamp if more information regarding this reached the neutral clans proof of the colonists becoming involved in and even joining the side of the mordok could sway heavily on the decision to join clan nightriver and the colonistsa large supply of pineed sap was delivered to the watchwolves in a combined effort from the mardrun trading consortium and pack longfang a number of the daughters of gaia and the veteran soldiers are grateful to have such a large stockpile to help with the sick and wounded although morale increases in the western settlement fear still grips the watchwolf villagers as their need for supplies to help them through the winter and troops to guard their borders is still obvious that and combined with continued reports of grimward hunters being seen just outside the settlements and farms has the watchwolves on edge rumors continue to spread about the watchwolves pulling out of the war or leaving their lands both having no base for truth at the moment stormjarl continues to send letters and offer a handsome reward of coin supplies or other things needed in exchange for warriors to join their cause news of this spreads like wildfire in the colony as professional mercenaries talk over games of dice in taverns and pack their bags and head for the stormjarl port the lightly defended villages near the stormjarl front line are attacked in full force by stormjarl warriors and some of their allies forcing grimward to stubbornly defend or quickly abandon these locations news of the counter offensive has yet to reach most of the colonies but it is clear the clan stormjarl intends to fight for its land and has the coin to pay for help the ships on the horizon finally make themselves known and fly the colors of clan squallborn small ships sleek and lean combined with longships with hardened crews and veteran warriors are seen in the waters around clan stormjarl merchant ships returning to the colony talk of these squallborn ships blocking and even openly attacking any ships in the area unless confronted in earnest clan squallborn could effectively blockade clan stormjarl lands from getting help from clan nightriver and the colonies stories of glory and bravado trickle in from the area near the southern border of clan whiteoak clan axhound has led a series of daring raids on settlements and outposts along its border routing several whiteoak war packs and taking over some villages critical outposts further into whiteoak territory were also struck by coalition allies if the success of the initial raids continues clan whiteoak could be facing major losses to their supplies warriors and territories a large shipment of grain and food bounties from the final harvest in clan goldenfield arrived in nightriver territory recently the wagons loaded with supplies were guarded with some warriors but needed to fend off some minor bandit raids no real attempt was made at stealing the supplies but concern has been expressed that unless the roads are patrolled and a plan put into place for future wagons coming into the territory near the colonies to control the bandits clan goldenfield worries about being able to safely reach its allies this report also helps confirm numerous rumors of increased bandit activity especially to the south east news of the settlement of new oarsmeet being burned to the ground reaches the colonies survivors and refugees from the battle between the settlers in oarsmeet and prince aylins soldiers attempt to find a new home some are given a place in the colony others are offered work and a place in specific parts of the outlying settlements and some spread rumors of revenge on the colonies of new aldoria and newhope alike the colony continues to prepare for winter and worry continues to grow with the refugees from stormjarl still in the colony and more arriving from starkhaven and some failed outlying settlements the tax on the food stores in the colony has risen a small food riot breaks out as desperate colonists steal food from the main market place the city watch on hand calm the group quickly without much of an incident but it is proof that the situation in the colony continues to worsen the price of supplies has sky rocketed as demand increases as merchants seem to be blocking people from purchasing supplies some say this could be seen a natural price increase since supplies are valuable before winter but others speak rumors of something more going on  hawks arrive to numerous settlements delivering this same message all across mardrun to the coalition of allies i trust that this message reaches you well and i look forward to working alongside you all your sacrifice and service to my clans defense will never be forgotten and sagas of your prowess in battle will be sung for generations to come the coalition forces here in our lands have been immensely helpful in protecting our settlements and defenses although we dont understand your methods or your culture we are grateful that the call for aid was answered when we refused to heel to clan grimwards demands my scouts have brought information to me that clan axhound intends to raid against clan whiteoak and that they have been influential in convincing pack longfang to assist i advise you to stay your hand in this course of action as the real threat is on this side of the continent do not forget that grimwards campaign will not end with us our scouts report that the battle line has thinned it is obvious that grimward warriors have pulled back away from our territories they have either gone home or are potentially heading north that i am not certain either way there is an opportunity for my warriors to push back to attack grimward and free the villages and settlements that were captured last winter my warriors have trained rested and healed and they want vengeance last winter i chose to stay out of a war you sent me letters your allies sent me letters you asked me to make the right decision and not be forced into submission by clan grimward you promised aid and support and you made good on that promise my lands were saved from destruction but this war is far from over almost half of my clans lands were seized looted my people captured and taken away haygreth has dealt us a terrible blow and clan stormjarl will never forget this i refuse to allow this to go on unopposed to stand idly by and not try to free my enslaved people as we speak my warleader bolverk stormjarl is rallying warriors to move north and attack clan grimward we aim to free our settlement to the north of grimward occupation we have already begun striking back and will continue into the winter until the cold forces us home i call upon you again and ask that you send warriors and support to clan stormjarl territory and assist me in attacking haygreths forces i ask that the coalition assist me here where it matters and help us fight back against clan grimward i will gladly barter supplies or pay significant weight in silver for honorable warriors that will stand with me while helping us defend our remaining settlements will be rewarded we also seek warriors to help us take the fight to clan grimward and will pay more for that kind of service with honor graytir stormjarl clanleader of clan stormjarlwinter draws near as the temperature falls across mardrun and many people are moving to act one last time before the chill sets in reports continue to filter in to every significant settlement of soldiers wearing the green and blue of new aldoria laying siege to the port village of new oarsmeet many are fleeing for their lives while others are pleading for help to defend their homes they cannot hold much longer against a trained force such as they one they face however and require assistance soon or they will be lost perhaps distracted by larger events to which the public is kept in the dark the council of ten has remained surprisingly silent on the matter of these attacks in fact they have seemed rather inactive on many fronts as of late although the logistics of housing and supporting the massive number of stormjarl refugees has proven to be a monumental task in and of itself to make matters worse the number of refugees from starkhaven has only increased over the past month the lack of aid sent to their homes discouraging many from staying a major bastion of the human colonists starkhaven continues to support the many citizens therein but those who have chosen to leave in search of a more steady existence have been an additional and rather unexpected drain on resources clan axhound along with a number of warriors from pack longfang have begun their raids on their ancient rival clan whiteoak with the whiteoak warriors still fighting in grimward territory axhound has been asking for support in raids of whiteoak villages leaving their warriors without a home to which they might return axhound has been glad to work alongside the longfang warriors though they are not convinced of the coalition and its intentions enough to fully declare war on clan grimward reports have filtered in from clan stormjarl that they intend to retake as much of their homeland as they can before the winter sets in and they are willing to compensate any who assist them they urge caution however as traveling to them by land would require a trek through grimward territory they have also noticed a small fleet of longboats bearing the markings of clan squallborn dotting the horizon they have not declared their intentions as of yet although their presence has made many of the stormjarl sailors uneasy clan watchwolf granted a second wind in the form of a shipment of pineed sap harvested by pack longfang has set about rebuilding their settlements although the process is painfully slow and will certainly not be finished by the time of the first snowfall they have once again pleaded with their allies among the coalition for any and all assistance hoping to deter any further attacks from clan grimward whose movements the watchwolf scouts have noticed and reported in recent months drawing dangerously near to the border before disappearing with great haste painted on the walls of new oarsmeet to all free people of new oarsmeet should aldoria not cease their siege of our home i have received word that we would be well received inside of arragones district of new hope find me there and i will do what i can to help set you up with work should we have to leave our home i implore you to leave naught of use to aldoria this includes food buildings and perhaps most importantly the port it is better to see our city to ash then beneath the heels of new aldoriahollowas the fall continues to get cooler and the trees change color life continues on mardrun as farmers harvest their crops the quiet in the civil war becomes a welcome if ominous respite reports have reached the colonies that soldiers wearing blue and green have attacked the settlement of new oarsmeet no further information is known as very little information has been disclosed about what is happening the main colony of newhope continues to provide aid and shelter for a number of clan stormjarl refugees which is still proving to be quite a drain on resources and supplies it has been impressive that the council of ten can work together to keep the colony running and helping these ulven refugees some boats have arrived with new aldorian soldiers they have returned to the colonies from their time of defending stormjarls last settlement amongst them are some of the city watch of newhope rotating some of their troops home to see their families settlers have arrived in new aldoria and newhope from starkhaven claiming that conditions continue to worsen the orders supplies have run low and farmers have moved their families to other more prosperous settlements it appears that after relations went south between the order and their largest beneficiary baron richards they have returned to a financial and supply crisis the lions stationed in the pass at the great wolfs hackles continue to report that the pass is under control continued reports of organized banditry keep coming in and merchants are scared to travel with expensive wares threatening to drive up the costs of goods in the future this month clan axhound warriors have begun their campaign to raid against clan whiteoak territory their boasts of conquest and of fighting their hated neighbor are loud but in reality the smaller axhound clan will not be able to do major damage to the larger clan whiteoak without support from allies this bold move on axhounds part may be a way for the coalition to solidify another clan as an ally in the civil war against clan grimward if the warrior chieftain of clan axhound are appeased clan squallborn intentionally remaining quiet and avoiding political talks have recently mobilized a number of ships rumors say that their intentions in the war will most likely be made soon watchwolf allies to the north have requested additional aid they have said that with the previous raids on their territory destroying many of their farms and crops they are fearing the winter if it is as cold as the previous years allies stationed in their settlement receive iron rations as the farmers and settlers can spare very little a new militia is being trained by the handful of surviving watchwolf warriors but any further military attacks in earnest against their settlements will easily overwhelm these novice warriors coalition members primarily some of the factions and clan nightriver continue to provide aid and support and coordinated with their newest allies clans goldenfield steinjottun and shattered spear their aid is much needed in the war and gathering their support has been huge for the coalition clan riverhead and clan spiritclaw delegates met recently and sent a number of hawks to all of the clans their involvement in the civil war will remain neutral but they have joined forces to seek out the mordok activity in the great forest rumors spread about kragen bloodmoon traveling to numerous settlements in nightriver territory although the focus of the clan has been feeding and caring for the stormjarl refugees from last winter and patrolling and protecting the clan nightriver borders the nightriver warleader has been overseeing a large training effort of new war packs that has been going on for months making sure that weapons and armor are on hand for the new war packs the colonists are happy to hear that clan nightriver is well supplied and has numerous war packs on reserve but the clans allies grow concerned that multiple calls for aid have not been answered yetthe continent of mardrun is eerily quiet what culminated into a brutal and bloody fight in stormjarl territory over the winter has turned into a quiet break from the chaos spring and summer both have come and gone warriors nervously watch the horizon for the next attack and farmers work their fields while looking over their shoulder for raiders who might attack them and their property the defenses around the last remaining settlement of clan stormjarl held against the crashing tide of clan grimward invaders in the spring and then nothing scouts and hunters report that grimward forces remain in the conquered territory rumor has it that grimward without anyone to contest their control of most of stormjarls territory has isolated and conquered all the villages and remaining settlements looting of anything useful and even the capture of stormjarl villagers seems likely clan stormjarl is in no position to retaliate and take back their territory and instead has tried to recover from the fight gather as many supplies as possible and continue to expand on their defenses the yurnai river remains decimated with all the bridges still destroyed clan stormjarl is effectively cut off from the rest of the continent unless they travel by sea the watchwolves have sent word that the civil war in their territory has also been quiet grimward continues to wait just outside of watchwolf territory after being beaten back by coalition forces just like to the south haygreths forces have been eerily quiet the watchwolf leaders believe he is preparing to renew his attack and if they press north into watchwolf territory it is feared that the settlement cannot hold out further this western half of the clan spent the spring and summer licking their wounds and trying to recover from their stand against grimwards army and is not prepared to fight again rumors say that the watchwolves may attempt to speak terms with haygreth or that their involvement with the war may end soon but nothing has been confirmed and the political representatives to the clan have been quiet about the subject without additional allies they will not be able to hold for long isolated on the other side of the hackles the watchwolf clan has some hard decisions about their stance in regards to the war and how they will continue to be involved the calm in the civil war has been a welcome respite for most of the clans and settlements but after haygreths conquest of stormjarl being such a success his thirst for power and his quest to be rid of the colonists is not likely to be ended anytime soon now the warriors stationed on the borders of their territories wait day by day for when and where they will see the invaders strike next delegates from the clans have sent several messages and it seems like the political front is going well clan squallborn continues to remain aloof along with clan riverhead clan shattered spear impressed with the soldiers of vandregon and the rangers of crows landing helping them with their bandit problem have pledged their support to clan nightriver clan steinjotten and clan goldenfield have been assisting nightriver and solidifying their alliance clan spiritclaw remains neutral in the war as does clan ironmound but rumors have said that ironmound will most likely choose a side soon it is speculated that the leaders of clan ironmound fear becoming the new frontline if the watchwolves fall and may choose to join grimward in their cause to avoid clan stormjarls fate clan axhound has boasted that they will join the alliance as long as they have allies that will join them on their raid against clan whiteoak who continues to support grimwards war clan nightriver continues to support its allies maintain its borders and attempts to absorb the immense burden of housing thousands of stormjarl refugees more solidified lines are being drawn across the ulven clans on the continent strange reports continue to float around and rumors of a large mordok force still moving in the great forests of mardrun ulven hunting parties have vanished and a call has been sent out by clan whiteoak and clan riverhead to form a war part from nearby clans to seek out this threat and destroy it with all of the alliances being drawn by the clans this course of action may be difficult in the colonies prince aylin continues to expand new aldoria at an alarming rate his apparent wealth and thriving colony is collecting people and new settlers all the time the colony of newhope is taxed to the brink caring for all of the sick and wounded stormjarl refugees the poltical power struggle between the council of ten appears to be on hold for now but rumors say that it will begin anew and major changes will be coming in the future nobles whisper in hushed towns at meetings and gatherings as to who they believe is dealing with whom and what the outcome may beafter aprils slowdown in the war may has turned into a waiting game of helping refugees reinforcing stormjarl with supplies and basically just a bit of breathing room as factions and clans focus on the upcoming summer growing season day to day life takes over again but everyone keeps an eye on the horizon for what comes up next settlements see to their villages colonies to their people and trade and merchants continue to flow reports from the frontline trickle in saying that grimward continues to camp outside of the battle line between them and stormjarl the conquered settlements are ransacked entirely giving grimward riches supplies food weapons and shipbuilding materials more reports of mordok activity in the great forest reach different clans and a large tribe of mordok moved towards onsallas where a large skirmish broke out between the defenders of the village and some of their allies camped nearby the attack is barely repelled dozens upon dozens of mordok hit and run the combined forces and then disappear back into the swamp their true purpose unknownafter the heroic sacrifice of pack longfang and the reinforcements arriving from the colonies clan grimwards conquest of clan stormjarl has ground to a halt the survivors of stormjarl and their allies have setup a defense in the remaining territory and settlement of clan stormjarl and the grimward invaders have backed off and established an army camp several miles away from the settlement news of grimward sacking and pillaging everything in the outlying territory of clan stormjarl and taking hundreds of stormjarl prisoners finds its way to the defenders but without additional support there is little they can do the stalwart defense of clan stormjarl and their allies has forced haygreth to regroup his army and although there is no sign of them leaving the territory some have spoken rumors that haygreth grimward and graytir stormjarl may be able to discuss terms of peace clan stormjarl holds but its territories and the clan itself has been ravaged by the war with grimward and some say the clan will seek revenge on grimward for generations to come clan nightriver and the colony of newhope have offered to help with the sick wounded and displaced clan stormjarl refugees but after such a hard winter the toll of helping these people will be immense on their current resources in other parts of mardrun the mountain pass continues to be fortified by the order of arnaths fist and discussions continue to take place amongst the clans some say that the clanleaders are pushing for a grand moot or gathering to discuss matters influencing the ulven as a whole clan steinjutten who has allied itself with clan nightriver has reported that clan riverhead and clan shattered spear have been dealing with an uncommonly large mordok tribe that moved into the great forests several months agothis letter was sent out to several coalition and clan nightriver settlements to clan nightriver and the colonists to the coalition of allies on mardrun we the people of clan stormjarl are reaching out to you for aid in clan grimwards conquest for war they have given us no choice but to join them or face their wrath my clan does not share in their views of destruction and death for the colonists and took a stand that we would not join them and in return they march against us in war my people will stand strong and protect our borders but even now the reports of brutal fighting and death have reached me clan whiteoak warriors have been seen alongside clan grimwards war packs and they outnumber us even in the bitter cold of winter their warriors press on and attack our villages and settlements brave clan stormjarl war packs march to battle but without support i fear that we simply do not have the numbers to hold out against them i fear that clan grimward will use hawkhunters and stop our future messages so this may be the last message you receive until the spring i have heard reports of a coalition army of allies leaving the yurnai river and marching north to help the watchwolf clan will warriors be sent to replace them to assist us in our efforts recently leaders of your factions sent us letters via hawk stating that you would send help that you would rally with us against clan grimward that words were being spoken to the other clans to join this war that we do not fight this war alone i pray that your words bear truth if they do not my people may very well only survive this war in the sagas and stories of the lorespeakers signedgraytir stormjarl  clanleader of clan stormjarlthis letter was sent to out to the main settlements of the coalition  to my fellow ulven brothers and coalition allieswe have tasked our falconers with sending out a message to every settlement and faction that calls clan nightriver ally it has come to our attention that the war is picking up across the continent news has reached us of the honor debt of pack longfang to clan stormjarl and it has become clear that we have lost sight of potential allies in this war by dealing with our own borders and issues at home my diplomats have brought dire news to me that talks have not gone well with clan stormjarl and that they are making a decision by the first snowfall as to which side they will support during this war we have a hard choice to make we have one last chance to reach out and convince clan stormjarl that the colonists can peacefully coexist with ulven that call this land home their involvement in this war is vital unfortunately this could not come at a worse time as reports have reached me that clan grimward continues its assault on watchwolf territory to the north without reinforcements they will not hold out much longer i fear that we may not be able to focus on both kragen bloodmoon warleader of clan nightriver is coordinating new war packs and sending them against clan grimward war packs at this very moment we are also sending a new war pack north but our resources are stretched thin we have until the 10th of this month to formulate a plan and coordinate our forces i eagerly await your responses signed branthur nightriver  clanleader of clan nightriver  free people of mardrun this may very well be my last correspondence the grimwards enemies of gaias ways who forsake her tenets and emulate the gruesome trophy taking and blasphemous rituals of the mordok have routed our troops and besiege our final settlement where for countless generations my people have faithfully guarded the western horizon as was our sacred duty the watchwolves of luna have waited nine months for relief and our staunchest of allies the longfangs faithfully held the pass through the wolfs hackles though we opened our halls to colonists and fellow clans and organized the grand alliance against the undead incursion our pleas for help have gone unanswered as three seasons have come to pass a wise elder once said the true warrior does not love the flashing blade for its sharpness nor does he love the black fletched arrow for his sharpness nor does he love the glory of war a true warrior cares not for these things a true warrior cares only for the ulven people the clan the pack and the family those are the only things worth dying for though the watchwolves of luna are hopelessly outnumbered and besieged i raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolves promise you that we will not waver in our sacred duty to gaias children we will perform our sacred duty to protect the western horizon even if we fall to the last soul we do not do it for glory we do it because we know that should we fall a powerful portent of the apocalypse will come to pass we do it not for ourselves we do it not for selfish glory we do it for all the free people of mardrun we do it for the future of all ulven we give it our all because some things are worth dying for elders of stormjarl by the time you read this message it may very well be too late for my people but i urge you to look inwards in your chests beat the hearts of true warriors figuring out the right thing to do is always easy but finding the courage to do so is another matter entirely be brave my friends be brave the eyes and ears of the great wolf are upon you and you will be judged signed by my hand this day raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolvesfor the first time in days manetho permitted herself to relax she sat down on the stool outside the largest hut and closed her eyes leaning back against the rough logs of the wall her knees elbows and back were one solid ache and her head was beginning to spin from lack of sleep but the last of the fevers were finally going down and the village was beginning to come back to life not that it was much of a village near a dozen huts clustered around a communal green where the bakeovens had been built and not far off a pond with privies built much too near it for any healers comfort the inhabitants were all ulven save for one stray human but they shared no clan or tribe just a collection of farmers soldiers and survivors driven from their previous abodes by the civil war their houses were still new enough for there to be sap between some of the logs and even before the fever had sprung up among them their children had been holloweyed and too thin still calamity had been avoided thank the lizard that hed had his claw on them manetho never would have come this way had it not been for a toochatty blacksmith at hareford a days journey west hed heard there was a new settlement of the displaced but it wouldnt last long  why not well you know refugees hed said dirty bunch no matter what race they are no surprise theyre all getting sick  when shed arrived twelve of the adults and ten of the children had been near comatose the remainders had talked of sending for a mage they couldnt afford manetho was no mage just a healer with a satchel full of practical remedies and a tired dogged refusal to give up but this time at least that had been enough the children had recovered the quickest young spry folk with quick blood despite their deprivation and illness now as the last of the sickly adults groaned and staggered their way back towards health the children were having an impromptu holiday there were twenty of them all told and by any gods you cared to name they made a riot currently there was a minor war going on for possession of the tattered village greenboys versus girls the girls had the advantage of numbers but the boys made up for it in sheer volume not fair screamed thannet one of the girls ringleaders she was a fairhaired child the perfect picture of a young ulven with snowwhite fangs and chinablue eyes the image was somewhat spoiled by the sheer amount of mud coating her face and the front of her dress you cheated did not retorted ulmar he was younger than thannet skinny and sneaky the kind of child destined to one day slip daggers into other peoples backs hed gotten a fine head start on his career as a rogue by tripping thannet into the mud did so did not did so did not you said we couldnt throw mud we also said no pushing its rude but we never said no pushing into the mud thats different despite her exhaustion manetho stifled a laugh perhaps shed been wrong ulmar might have a future as a lawyer but the argument was escalating and to her great reluctance she forced herself to stand up a lot of screaming on the village green was not going to help the fever patients who were only just beginning to get the rest they needed settle down there she said picking her way across the muddy green towards the argument your parents are still trying to get their sleep and you hollering wont help them he threw mud at me did not i threw you in the mud s completely different hah you said you pushed me before cant you make up your mind liar lizard save them all there was a whole crop of lawyers coming up in this village manetho silently resolved to never get caught in a crime within fifty miles of the place she whistled loudly breaking up the argument yet again and crossed her arms if youre going to fight children do it quietly dont you remember how awful it felt when you were sick how much your heads hurt and how badly you wanted to throw up well lots of your parents still feel that way and if you screaming makes it worse then theyll thrash you black and blue once theyre better cant you play nicely thats boring one of the younger boys huffed there was a chorus of agreement from several of his compatriots ulven youngsters lovely and adorable until the mob started forming manetho played her trump card fighting children were often bored children after all all right she said if you promise to sit quietly then ill tell you another story to her great relief that got a chorus of eager agreement from the kids even thannet who often loudly prided herself on being too old and grownup for such babyish pursuits didnt object manetho was still new enough to have stories they hadnt heard yet after all and shed begun storytelling while children were still getting over their fevers now shed happily tell every last tale all over again if it would buy her patients a few more minutes of godsdamned peace and quiet all right make yourselves comfortable she said pointing to a patch of grass away from the mud the children did so with all the grace and ease one expected of ulven scrambling into place bumping into each other and breaking out in miniature scuffles over whod pulled whose hair and who took whose spot it was like watching a pile of puppies fight manethos good humor faded a little at the sight in ten years these children would be farmers craftsmen tailors bardsbut all of them in a pinch soldiers the ulven for all the mockery she could throw at them and often did she would admit had a vitality and strength to them that her own race conspicuously lacked ulven were the bulwark of mardrun and these children would in their turn hold the line against mordok and each other her tribe had been different thered been few children among the deshret syndar and though each one was prized there was much to learn and heavy burdens to lay on their shoulders there had always been the consciousness of being one of the few secret set apart despised even by their syndar brethren if she had been young again she might have envied these ulven children their freedom and ease being as old as she was she instead mourned for what they would have to face now she said trying to shake off her thoughts and put on a facade of good cheer as she sat down in front of them i have a lot of stories but youve heard most of them already so we might have to come up with something new talk about the battle for the ironmound village called one voice from the back that ones boring said another manetho belatedly identified that speaker olaf the soldiers son an aspiringthough for the moment stupendously untalentedbard tell the one about the blackpaw and the redeyed man that got a chorus of assent from several of the girls manetho had told that story the first time they wanted a tale heavily edited of course with all real names altered and the characters ginned up to resemble something from a good heroic myth the girls had especially enjoyed it who didnt like a story about a strong woman standing firm against a vile fiend no mention of a syndar healer ignominiously begging on the ground that didnt make a very good story the group consensus however was against the blackpaw tale as much as they liked it theyd heard it twice more since then and novelty was what the mob demanded another squabble broke out and the children temporarily stopped arguing to cheer on the two battlers manetho mentally ran through her list of stories and waited for the dust to settle again when it had the winner triumphant the loser insisting he wasnt really trying to fight honestly i pulled every punch manetho had decided how about  she paused for effect the tale of the thorn curse this was a risky move it was an old story stretching back far beyond mardrunand knowing her tribe farther back than her own lineage she rarely had a chance to tell these stories because they were full of things that mardrun children would have no reference for crocodiles and djinni and hot blazing deserts things that even she recalled only in dreams but shed used up her stock of other tales and if they really wanted novelty they would have to call on the spirit of faedrun for a few brief minutes there was some hemming and hawing among the children at that but the word curse was usually a guaranteed winner and they assented manetho made herself comfortable crossing her legs and pulling her leopardskin over her shoulders to drape just right and began now attend and listen that was the traditional way to begin these stories it was ceremonial and solemn both an instruction and a warning and guaranteed to silence every deshret syndar in hearing distance as far as manetho could figure it was the syndar equivalent of the ulven you have impugned my honor or the human if you dont shut up right now so help me ill it didnt have much of an effect on the gathered children but then they werent deshret once in days long past in a tribe of syndar on the cusp of the high red desert there lived a brother and sister who were orphaned at a young age the boy was near to manhood grown and the girl was of an age to be wed but because they had no parents he had not been permitted to fletch his first arrows and she had not been permitted to put on her mothers leopard cloak seeing that the assembled young ulven didnt understand the gravity of this insult manetho quickly improvised some extra details they were made to work like slaves all day every day carrying heavy jars of water and cleaning the tents of the elders that got more approval no child whatever their race or origin liked having to carry and clean their names were khepri and serket those are stupid names said one unidentified young critic of literature in the back of the group theyre not stupid theyre syndar manetho told him they mean beetle and scorpion that got a chorus of giggles from her audience id die if my parents named me beetle said olaf to general assent and scorpions are gross that was thannet not to be outdone in voicing her opinion they are manetho agreed but in the deserts of faedrun there were scorpions as big as your arm and there were gigantic black beetles that would come alive out of balls of dung dried dirt even though theyd been dead before beetles and scorpions had powerful magic and you wanted to be respectful of them being named khepri or serket would be like being named wolf or bear oh thannet considered thatd be okay i guess im glad my tribes ancient and revered traditions meet with your majestys approval manetho did not say though she was thinking it quite loudly best to keep the tart tongue for her patients who were in need of correcting and often unable to run away instead she took up the thread of the story again one day it came time for there to be a great meeting of all the elders of different tribes the elders were to speak together and discuss the future of their tribes who would marry who would share knowledge and whether they would make war khepri and serket were ordered to prepare the bathhouse tent of crocodile skin and they carried dozens of jars of water from the river and built great fires to heat the water at last worn out by their work the twins fell asleep behind the bathhouse tent when they awoke the elders were standing over them furious at them for sleeping what is this cried one of the elders these worthless young fools cannot even serve us as our importance demands unreasonable shouting adults were always another easy villain for child audiences that got some frowns and hisses from the group the original word in the tale had translated as honor not importance but ulven had very different concepts of honor from the deshret and manetho had finagled the translation a little honor was to be respected among ulven selfimportance and smugness not so much you must prove to us that you are worthy of being our kin and not just lazy lieabouts declared the greatest of all the elders you shall have a task you will go forth into the sunset and walk until you find the place where the moon sleeps there you shall find a mountain and in the mountain you will find a cave and in the cave you will find a bundle of thorn branches bring us the thorn branches and all will be forgiven but be wary and do not commit any act which will disgrace your tribe for it is known that one of us speaks for all of us and one shame is shame upon us all so it was said and so they must do khepri fletched his first arrows and serket put on the leopard cloak of her mother and they went out together into the world for three days they followed the moon and could not find the place where it slept on the dawning of the fourth day they came upon a woman lying on the sand a cloth covering her eyes khepri looked upon her and saw that she was beautiful with long black hair as shining as a starlings feathers and mooncolored skin that had never known the sun and he told serket they must stop and help this woman we must not said serket she is not of our tribe and she will see any misstep we make one shame will shame us all brother but it is shameful to leave someone to die said khepri and they halted they gave the woman water and revived her but when she awoke she cried out and veiled her face leave me she said my sight is so keen that i can see a flys eyes a thousand miles away the sun blinds me and i am useless to you but khepri and serket shared with her some of their black eye paint and she could see again and so the three traveled on together here manetho paused to swipe some of her own black mesdemet from her eyelid and playfully poked erik in the nose he giggled and went crosseyed trying to see the smudge of black left behind three more days passed and as the sun rose on the fourth they came upon a man sitting on the sand his hands wrapped in bandages serket looked upon him and saw that he was handsome with strong shoulders like a warriors and hair the color of the sun and told khepri that they must stop and help him we must not said khepri he is not of our tribe and may be a bandit or a criminal one shame will shame us all sister but it is shameful to leave someone to die said serket and they halted they gave the man water and revived him but when he woke he cried out and bowed his head leave me he said i am a swordsman of rare strength able to cleave a mans head from his body a thousand times a day but my hands are broken and i am useless to you but serket and khepri cleaned his wounded hands and rebound them and he was able to grip his sword hilt again and so the four of them traveled on together three more days passed as the sun rose on the fourth day they came upon twin children a little boy and a little girl asleep upon the sand the boys skin burned with fever and the girls skin shivered with cold now khepri and serket did not speak of any shame for they were far beyond where they had begun and knew well how it hurt to be an abandoned child they halted and revived the children with water while the woman keeneyes kept watch and the man swordarm guarded them please leave us said the little boy we are cursed evil spirits hate us said the little girl evil spirits was not a satisfactory translation of djinni but it was the best manetho could manage on the fly i am forever breathing out wintery winds and my brother forever brings forth scorching flames we are not meant to live and so we were cast out of our tribe we will not leave you said khepri we see now that many people have been cruelly given to the desert when they are no longer thought useful to abandon the injured and the cursed is the only true shame said serket and they gave the girl iceeyes a heavy cloak to contain her chill and wetted clay poultices to soak up the boy firehands flames three more days they walked until they came at last to a mountain in the midst of the desert when they looked up to the sky they beheld no place between the tip of the mountain and the rim of the moon and they knew they had found the place where the moon slept they entered into the cave and found there the bundle of thorn branches surrounded on all sides by the bodies of the dead the children had been sitting quietly absorbing the tale but glossing over bodies was too much for an ulven audience what kind of bodies someone yelled were they gross another added i bet they were gross olaf naturally i bet youre gross and that was thannet not to be outdone the bodies were  manetho momentarily groped for a translation heqer hungry would not carry the same meaning to these children of mardrun stymied in her search for correctness she went with gore instead the bodies were hideous beyond measure there were men and women all in armor with swords strung up on the walls their faces were contorted in horrible leers their lips peeled back their teeth exposed great wounds had been gashed from their bellies and their withered organs lay about their feet tiny spiders were skittering out of their rotting eye sockets the children were pleased seeing this terrible sight khepri and serket and their friends halted for there was no monster in their sight that might have slain those men then they knew there was some evil magic on the thorn branches beware said the woman keeneyes there are webs across those branches o my friends webs too fine for any other eye to see serket took her black eye paint and blew a cloud of it and there the webs stood revealed then came a horrible bloodchilling shriek for isfet the great spider saw its trap had failed and fell upon them she had a fair sense of her audience now and didnt hesitate to add more juicy details isfet was the greatest the queen of all evil spiders she was as tall as a tree and as long as a longhouse her fangs each as big as a dagger dripped green poison that made the stone floor smoke where it dropped her eight eyes rolled madly as she bore down on the travelers but the brave companions would not be frightened khepri brought forth his bow and shot many arrows at the beast making it shriek in pain while the man swordarm waited for his chance at last with a mighty blow he struck the vile isfet howled in pain as her jaws were cleaved open and she thrashed wildly her treetrunk legs thumping and smashing on the floor but khepris aim was true and this next arrow put out one of her evil yellow eyes as she screamed in fury swordarm struck again her body fell into two pieces steaming with black smoke and dripping black blood and together in triumph the heroes took up the thorn branches and went home manetho let that sit for a moment the children were grinning at each other clearly imagining themselves in the role of the heroic spiderslayers but she said and they looked up again it was now clear to them that these thorn branches could not be ordinary why would simple branches be guarded by such a hideous monster and the companions wondered why it was that they had been sent to steal these things from isfet the great spider did the elders send them on a quest that would kill them or was there something in the branches that the elders wanted khepri and serket were troubled when they neared the place where the tribe had camped and saw again the distant bathhouse tent of crocodile skin they did not go into the camp instead they sent young iceeyes and firehands who were quiet and clever to hear what they could hear the children crept unseen by the batthouse tent and heard the elders speech i do not think khepri and serket live said one they are too long gone so be it said another but if they have survived imagine it brothers the cursed thorn army will be ours to command at last there shall be no more tribes but an empire of feral syndar and we its emperors a couple of the children booed and thannet hissed between her teeth feral syndar were not always wellloved whether among their syndar brethren or the other races and threatening an evil army of them was a good cheap way to get the audience on your side though to be fair there was more to it than the feral concerns these children had had enough of wars and armies to last a lifetime when iceeyes and firehands returned to their companions and told what they had heard there could be no more waiting for the elders who counseled so strongly against shame and bad conduct had committed the worst of sins in hopes of simple power as night fell the group fell upon the camp together with their companions khepri and serket brought swift and unrelenting vengeance on the faithless liars who had been their elders that needed more details of course iceeyes and firehands put their hands together and as her eldritch cold mingled with his scorching heat a thick fog arose to blanket the camp within the fog came serket singing a mourning song appearing from the mist like a demon from the darkness the evil elders cried out in terror for they were sure this must be a ghost sent to punish them but one who had said they would be emperors had no faith in any god and would not believe in spirits its a trick he cried out slay her my brothers or all is lost and they would have slain her but hidden within the mist was the noble swordarm who would not see serket harmed no sooner had the faithless elder spoken than he spoke no more for swordarm struck manetho clapped her hands once making the children jump and let her head sag back making a terrible gurgling noise as the elder was slain his head went rolling across the camp and came to a stop at serkets feet she picked up the head and cried out death to the faithless who would kill their kin for power and betray all their honor then came khepri his bow in hand he loosed a dozen arrows in a dozen seconds and the elders fell gurgling on their own blood the children were jumping up and down now grinning from ear to ear laughing with the joy of seeing evil punished manetho was swept up in the story herself she gestured broadly miming the cut and thrust of battle inventing new details on the spur of the moment but another lurked behind him shrouded in the mist he was the youngest of the elders a bare hundred years and he was as clever as he was evil he dreamed of being an emperor and crushing all who were not syndar under his heel and so he leapt upon khepri rising out of the mist like a vile spirit of death beware cried the woman keeneyes behind you for even the thick mist which the children had conjured was no barrier to her sight khepri dodged at the very last moment and the treacherous elders blade struck only the sand there was no time for his bow khepri seized an arrow from his quiver and as the elder raised his knife again he struck with the arrow in his fist it pierced the elders heartand as the wind came and the mist began to thin away the liar fell and there was silence in the camp they had won manetho took a deep breath she was somewhat aware that shed been shouting at some point and that was really not acceptable so much for peace and quiet for her patients but the children were smiling and the old tale had new life in the tongue of mardrun her heart beat a little faster taking another breath though she calmed herself and let her voice lower again to bring them towards the conclusion of the story when the battle was done and keeneyes swordarm iceeyes and firehands were seen there with them there were cries among some of the foreign tribesmen for here were their sons and daughters who had been forced out into the desert at command of the elders there was weeping and joy as keeneyes mother embraced her daughter and swordarms father his son and at the last when all was finished there were feasts and weddings for khepri married the lovely keeneyes and serket wed the handsome swordarm and when the prayers were said the bundle of cursed thorn branches was cast into the fire so that whatever evil army was in its power could tempt no more in life health strength it was so    evening was drawing on now the children were gathered into one of the huts where thannets mother was dishing out watery stew from an enormous cauldron in another day or two when all of the adults were back on their feet everyone would go back to their own homes and the daily life of the village would resume for now it was enough that theyd all gotten through another day manetho did the evening rounds preparing fresh teas for the patients and taking the pulse of the remaining fever cases doing well all of themthe totems be thanked for their mercies spring fevers didnt always kill but too many had come too close for her liking and to not lose a single one in such a large group was always something to be thankful for her plan to get her patients some peace and quiet had gone a little awry the minute the story ended a miniature battle had broken out with various children all taking the roles of khepri and serkets magical companions and gleefully declaring that they would slay each other lacking fire and ice for the battle mud had sufficed and several of the children now eating supper looked more like bedraggled bog mummies than anything else lesson learned next time tell them something with a little less blood in it but  damnation it had felt good manetho tilted her head back and looked at the sky the sun was sinking and the edges of the world were darkening the first glimmer of stars could be seen on the blue velvet of the horizon she hadnt told the story how it was meant to be told but shed told it anyway and for a few minutes all the tire and terror of the world had seemed to melt away her own childhood heroes and her tribes words had lived again they had life these ulven children did they had energy and spirit and swiftrunning blood and despite the deprivations of war and their own recent sickness they laughed and battled with a fire in their eyes she wondered sometimes about their great wolf was he truly a god to them or was he simply a totem like her lizardsome wise animal spirit who had for reasons known only to himself taken an entire people under his paw either way he had his work set before him and no mistake spring was coming on summer would be here soon enough and with spring and summer came war as inevitable as the rising of the tide and the flight of geese manetho hadnt been in any of the larger towns since the fall but she still had ears and shed heard the rumors honorbound gone missing a move against the mordok and always the whispers of discontent among the clans and the benevolent bland smile of prince aylin that said everything and meant nothing she looked at the sky again you be good to them wolf she said thannet and olaf and erik and ulmar and all the rest flashed before her smiling and brighteyed smeared with mud and ready to sink their teeth into any challenge had brynja and reyna and their ilk ever been so carefree be good to them she repeated or ill ask the lizard to shave you bald wolf they deserve better than this read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1841catherinebutzenstoryixzz5gbpdvqe4this story was written by a group of players that took a chance and willingly signed up with their pcs for a special event that took place in january of 267 2018 joining this hunt forced the players to be at the mercy of the story where their preparedness resources and skills were factored into the impact they would have in this sidestory players had a chance to lose their characters or be severely maimed due to injuries but also be involved in a unique story element and make a significant impact on the following event of that month after rolling randomly to determine the encounters their impact and the wounds received during the fighting the players involved decided to narrate what their pcs went through and turn it into a story pack longfang joining the great wolfs honored hunt january 267 in december of 266 visitors came to clan ironmound territory to meet with representatives and delegates of the different clans of the ulven people tensions were high as wounded honor and feuds threatened to derail some of the focus of the upcoming grand moot the leaders were able to discuss many options of what the future could hold and directions the ulven people could take   camilla birchborne acting high priestess of clan riverhead brought with her two important messages the first was that clan riverhead was no more with the death of the clanleader the impending passing of the ill warleader and the breakdown of the high priestess the leadership of clan riverhead has been ravaged in a short amount of time the surviving chieftains have supported this new direction of being absorbed into other clans primarily clan shattered spear the second is that camilla believes there to be an upcoming great portent that the ulven people must not dismiss in january of 267 the moon will shine full not once but twice and she and the other priestesses feel that this is the time for action for the ulven people   the grand moot was held and was over surprisingly fast setting aside differences for now the ulven people as a whole will begin coordinating with the colonists to sweep through and clear ulven lands primarily the great wolfs hackles and the great forest to prepare for a large construction project to build a series of defenses to the north called the shield of mardrun starting in the spring of 267 the time for ulven to sit idly by and allow each clan to fend for themselves is over the ulven pack is coming together and taking the fight to the mordok   as the first step of taking the fight to the mordok a group of ulven warpacks and their colonist allies are moving into the great forest to sweep and clear it of mordok forcing confrontation with the mordok is key to the victory as any tribes or group of mordok slipping through and rejoining other mordok will prolong the efforts of clearing ulven territory   however with the blessings of the high priestesses of the clans the warleaders have begun putting together warpacks of veteran warriors that will join the great wolf in his hunt on the first full moon of the year instead of staying indoors veteran ulven and warriors looking to gain word fame have pledged their support and hope to be chosen this highly ritualistic event will spearhead the efforts to take the fight to the mordok under a united cause of both ulven and colonist alike   one of the groups that quickly volunteered to be chosen were the warriors and hunters of pack longfang they were assigned to a clan steinjottun chieftain that was smart reserved and well respected by his warriors he was not a chieftain who earned the title by being too brash and bold he liked to think calculate and then act his name was trygvy steinjottun and he was pleased to be given the chance to fight alongside some of the veteran warriors of pack longfang trygvys warpack was well supplied if rather basic and able to move out and be a part of the great wolfs hunt   among the assembled longfangs were ranmir halvar runa brynja thrand fritha bryech throm and dorn every volunteer to attend the hunt was ulven syndar and human were forbidden from being allowed on the great wolfs hunt dorn tallstag had been traveling with pack longfang for some time on the first month of the year 267 he was not only one of the ulven chosen for the great honor of being allowed to hunt alongside the great wolf but he was also the only one with half human blood in his veins a oneofakind exception allowed on his momentous occasion   the honored warpacks were blessed with sacred rites by numerous witches of various ulven clans this was not to be a military campaign or a sprawling war effort with allies and supply lines this was going to be a dangerous and ritualistic fight against incredible odds and hardship ulven were going to die and be judged by the great wolf during this hunt in large numbers they were all prepared for it   soon after assembling the warpacks were given an estimated area to move into the great forest and fight the mordok it was a simple plan move and fight it didnt take long after venturing into the great forest when trygvys warpack came upon a large group of mordok their numbers vastly overwhelmed the size of the warpack and worry was quick to darken the thoughts of the steinjottun warriors too much fear would be judged harshly by the great wolf on this hunt the chieftains initial orders faltered a bit as his calculating mind tried to devise a plan of what to do then worry melted away and eventually turned to bravado as the warriors looked to the veteran longfangs and saw ulven that were not only absent of fear but almost relishing in the thought of the upcoming fight even outnumbered the longfangs stepped forward ready to do battle this bravado steeled the resolve of the warpack and they marched straight into the larger group of mordok   dorn tallstag the newest member of pack longfang and the small group of veteran longfang warriors moved through the woods towards the group of mordok in front of them his vision was limited due to his large helm he saw mordok clustered around something possibly a corruption site of some kind being half human and new he was still coming to grips with the thought of being allowed on this honored hunt he would not dishonor himself or his pack and he would fight hard today as they got closer one of the other fighters tapped dorn on the shoulder and gestured to something to his left it was too late an arrow flew out of the darkness glanced off of dorns armor and hit the warrior in the face the ulven collapsed with the arrow protruding from his skull another small group of mordok slunk out of the darkness from which the arrow came dorn hefted his axe as the shield wall formed in front of him he knew the fight ahead of them was going to be difficult   with me charge bryech roared as he motioned with his sword and ran forward the warpack followed bryech was sure much to the contempt of the chieftain who led the warpack the force before them was overwhelming the mordok outnumbered them at least two to one this was no time to fight cautiously if they wanted to win this fight they would need unexpected brutality that was exactly what bryech planned to deliver and the mordok responded in kind the two forces made a deafening amount of noise as they thundered towards each other bryech didnt think he didnt worry about how strong the enemy was all he wanted was to kill them all bryech sidestepped the first mordok to come in range and spun around making a long cut up the beasts back with a noticeable eruption of blood trailing his sword moving onto the next mordok rushing towards him bryech parried high with his sword and edged his foe with his shield knocking the beast over and followed up with a quick strike to finish the mordok off before it could recover the battle was on in full now a rough battle line had formed with both sides fighting viciously bryech took down another mordok after a small exchange of blows before he could move on a sharp pain below his left shoulder caused him to drop his shield bryech knew an archer had hit him and went to pull the arrow from his arm he broke the shaft in half and pulled hard through gritted teeth the rest of the shaft came out clean but the head broke off and fell out of his sleeve bryech recovered his shield and made his way toward halvar who had seemed to have gotten into an area of heavy fighting    bryech he heard it but didnt look to see who said it because immediately after an arrow deflected off his helm and knocked him back slightly   now im pissed bryech said to himself before rushing to halvars side with a battle cry     brace your shield halvar exclaimed as bryech approached halvar thrust his long axe past the head of one of the mordok in front of him and hooked it around its neck with a strong pull back with his axe halvar smashed the mordoks face into the metal boss of bryechs shield breaking the jaw of the mordok with a crunch and splattering blood on the shield as the mordok recoiled and grabbed its face halvar wound up and planted a heavy cleave into the mordoks chest it flew backwards several steps and crumpled to the ground   as soon as halvar recovered from the heavy swing an arrow darted out and hit him in the upper part of his left arm grimacing in pain he stepped backwards and took a knee to focus on tearing it out suddenly frithas shield appeared in front of him and was immediately met by a second arrow her quick reflexes saving halvar from the attack halvar and fritha made eye contact and halvar nodded in appreciation before tearing out the arrow with a grunt of pain and then returning to the fight   ranmir held back as the two opposing forces clashed he thought to himself that with the larger opposing force this would be a time for decisive shots not distracting ones he saw bryech take an arrow to the shoulder and returned the favor with an arrow to the mordoks eye    ranmir loosed arrow after arrow each finding its mark as one of the filthy black mongrels charged with an axe above his head ranmir loosed and watched an arrow sprout from its chest just in time for thrand to come down on it with an axe of his own   ranmir continued to peer at the enemy line as he heard someone shout ranmir behind you was that brynja or runa it didnt matter now he turned to see a mordok that had snuck around the lines barreling down on him he loosed the arrow into the mordoks arm reached to his quiver and grabbednothinghe had lost count like a deer facing a wolf ranmir froze for a second then tossed his bow aside grabbed his knife and dagger and drove them into the stomach of the mordok as he was tackled and then feltnothing he expected a counter attack from the mordok but when he tumbled to a stop the mordok was dead blood gushed from the two deep stab wounds of his weapons into the beasts belly   the blood pumped through throms veins as his double bit axe cleaved through a mordok shield splintering the once protective equipment into kindling with a quick movement of his arm the axe spun around and landed deep into the chest of the foolish beast with that one falling another one came in fast and tackled throm to the ground a foolish mistake as he slammed the mordok down and pulled out a dagger and started to stab with terrifying ferocity the mordok bit and tore at his shoulder a decent amount the attacks being thwarted by the mail armor the beast was felled when the blade of his knife went through its neck relieving it of its lifeblood    with a roar brynja threw herself into the fray it had been far too long since she had fought by bryechs side and his ferociousness and tenacity were infectious as she connected with the first of the mordok she planted her shield in the beasts hips and thrust upward tossing it heavily over her shoulder and sending it sprawling the warriors behind her would surely have that one handled she knew without thinking and pressed forward   brynja had grown accustomed to fighting sidebyside with the experienced longfang warriors since she began lending her training as an instructor to the pack nearly a year ago their skill and coordination were evident as spear and shield and sword worked as one to slowly but surely slay mordok after mordok she fell into a rhythm with her allies allowing her reflexes to take over her mind drifted to onsallas to her mate who was waiting for her safe return like a bucket of cold water the thought of naveeve snapped brynja back into the moment instincts be damned she would make sure she would survive the day to come home once more   runa swung her hammer down over a mordoks head caving it in with a sickening crunch and coating the hammer in brains and blood another mordok ran at her from her left she ripped the hammer out of what was left of the mordoks skull and reeled back to swing again with a grunt of effort the hammer was heavy and her swing easy to see but the power it generated was staggering he opponent thought they were clear of the reach of the weapon the mordok was dead wrong runa hit her target square in the ear caving its head in from the side runa looked to her side and saw thrand and fritha fighting together holding mordok away from her flank time and time again thrands long axe darted out to hack pull or cleave into shields and bodies frithas stalwart defense and use of her shield kept the mordok at bay forcing them to endure the attacks from the longfangs support weapons when an opportunity presented itself or when a mordok decided to close the gap frithas mastercrafted clan ironmound sword slashed out and punished them for it   the fight went well dorns axe rained terror down upon the mordok at one point one of the archers tried to get around to flank the ulven group but dorn charged the archer by himself the mordok tried to shoot him but his armor was too strong for the arrows to penetrate the arrow simply buried itself into the layered leathers and mail and snapped off before doing any real damage the archer simply ran and fled not wanting to close to melee   the rest of the warpack traded blows with the mordok and killed them quickly the ground became awash in bright crimson blood from both sides of the line steinjottun warriors bore witness to the ferocity and skill of the longfangs and pressed in consumed by battle lust then it was just over the mordok melted away from the fight almost as quickly as they had charged into it   bryech gave a yell of victory encouraging the fleeing mordok to run away faster    bryech are you injured let me tend to your wounds said thrand through labored breaths   im fine tend to those who actually need it bryech replied distantly his thoughts obviously elsewhere bryech walked off to find the chieftain of the warpack they needed to discuss their next move   ranmir checked over his equipment sitting i didnt realize there were this many in the forest he said to no one in particular   leaning heavily against a tree brynja began to count her many new bruises and tried to stretch out her aching shoulder the joint protested every inch with searing pain an axe had struck true during the battle though her armor had saved her from the worst of the damage she would need to see a healer about the wound before the next fight   after the mordok had fled the group went back to camp where a caravan had dropped off more supplies the warpack resupplied and took a small break to heal rest and get any armor mended that they could throm sat down and started to hone his axe and hunting knife his body slightly weary and battered but nothing too worse for the wear for the moment his shoulder did ache and bleed a decent amount but it wasnt something he couldnt work with still the pain was starting to become more than a slight annoyance as the adrenaline left him it was a small break energized by their overwhelming win they yearned for more blood the steinjottun warriors seemed almost shocked at how the veteran longfang warriors recovered so quickly from such a pitched battle   they regrouped and went after the fleeing mordok finding the mordok was was easy enough the freshly disturbed ground and drops of blood an easy trail to follow the mordok were found rather quickly much to both the surprise of the resting mordok and the assembled warpack   cut them down bryech ordered he spoke with a calm fury bryech walked towards the small band of mordok with the warriors that accompanied him the two groups were almost even so he knew they wouldnt run when he got close bryech struck out with surprising speed and quickly enveloped himself in the fight   despite the protests she could already hear from her distant mate brynja readied herself to crush the fleeing mordok injured or not she would not let her packmates have all the glory with her shoulder still tender she slung her shield over her shoulder and produced the large sword at her side the mordok had taken her deep in the swamp long ago she intended to exact her revenge this day   bryech moved his group like a wolf pack making swift work of any mordok still brave enough to fight them but eventually grew more reserved as his warriors grew too tired or injured to continue the way they had   the battle was going rather smoothly however two mordok decided to flank and try and ambush fritha and thrand and throm spotted the flankers as they approached his blood was up and his legs kicked against the ground all the flanking mordok witnessed was a large blur rush towards them roaring tell the great wolf throm hellhound nightriver sent you an axe chop to a knee a fist to the face and a shattered jaw left the mordok out of the fight its partner tried to rush throm with a large axe a fatal mistake for throm was in no mood for humoring a one on one fight throm glared at the mordok and spoke only these words with only bile in his voice the maw devour you both thrand and fritha moved to assist and the three of them cut down the remaining flanker   halvar yelled to track them all down and kill every one of them all the group gave chase and the ulven who could still run did they gathered any arrows on the way pulling them out of the dead mordok handing the majority of them off to ranmir or putting them in his quiver so he could start pulling them out and plugging them into the backs of mordok so they could be pulled out and used again until they splintered from use    after all of the mordok who had fled had been cut down or lost in the woods the longfangs regrouped with the warpack to plan out the next move while talking a scout came with a message to the chieftain in charge of this warpack there was another warpack that was not faring well and the scout was asking for help immediately the warpack was nearby and after a solid fight they were on their way back to a nearby staging area to regroup and were beset upon by a large group of mordok they tried to fallback but the mordok force dogged them ferociously and they decided to stand and fight the steinjottun chieftain being reserved and concerned for his own pack did not feel comfortable sending the group out so soon for another encounter although another warpack was in trouble the steinjottun warriors were simply too spent exhausted or hurt from the heavy fighting   when the longfangs learned of this they quickly grouped together to talk about it this was not something they could let stand they approached the steinjottun chieftain fritha stepped forward to speak on behalf of the longfangs present and asked if they could be permitted to leave the warpack to assist the others the chieftain hesitated but gave his permission the longfangs who stood for honor and protection in the face of adversity quickly packed up gave quick good byes and thumps on the back to their brothers and sisters in arms and left to aid those who needed it more    after traveling a fair distance and following the scout as quickly as they could the longfang veterans soon came upon a gruesome scene another large band of mordok was in a pitched fight against another warpack their clan origin was unknown and all that mattered is that there were ulven fighting against the mordok and these ulven appeared to be losing   with little delay the longfangs roared into the fight their iconic bark ringing out three times above the clamor of battle as they crashed into the side of the mordok force they fought their way through to where the other warpack was holding out the shield wall didnt hold for much longer after they got there their presence attracted more and more mordok  in a short amount of time any semblance of two battle lines broke apart into a swirling mess of chaos as warriors from both sides broke off paired up or reformed to fight anything in front of them it was in this moment that the ferocity of single combat could quickly decide the victor something the mordok excelled at   bryech fought ferociously his armor and shield broken beyond proper use his sword had yet to fail him so he did what he could bryech swung at a mordok but his attack was blocked and the beast took advantage of his lowered defenses and sliced just below bryechs knee bryech grimaced but fought through the pain throwing a punch with his left hand bryech made solid contact with the mordoks jaw sending it reeling it wasnt enough to stop the mordok as it dropped in and suddenly grappled bryech as quickly as he could he went in and met the grapple grabbing it around the waist and taking the beast down bryech followed with a series of quick strikes to the head and neck making the mordoks face a bloody mess he knelt above his now dead opponent and surveyed the battlefield his fatigue finally starting to catch up with him bryech heard footsteps behind him but he was too slow and tired to react quick enough bryech felt immense pain pierce through his back and out his front looking down he saw a sword protruding from his lower abdomen bryech jumped back knocking his attacker off balance and turned to hack into the mordoks neck the strike was vicious tearing just as much as it cut the mordok dropped convulsing and making an awful gurgling noise as it choked on its own blood bryech staggered away and leaned against a nearby tree reaching for the short sword sticking out of his back it was an awkward angle but slowly painfully he removed the sword blood pooled in the hole it left but it didnt bleed as bad as he had thought apparently it hadnt caught anything immediately vital bryech turned away from the tree clutching his side to continue the fight after a short walk he managed to catch an archer off guard and knocked its bow from its hand only to receive a lightning fast dagger to the abdomen bryech dropped his sword and staggered clutching the blade now embedded in his torso he quickly realized that he would not be able to endure much longer the mordok pulled back and started to call for more mordok to come and watch its kill bryechs vision swam and his reality faded he almost passed out until he heard a voice to his right   you promised it said bryech looked and saw ingrid as if she was truly in front of him he even felt her touch when he reached out to cup her face in his hand felt her always cool finger wrap around the outside of his own hand i knew i would lose you she said tears rolling down her cheeks bryech felt a fire in his chest   the mordok turned back towards its victim seeing what looked like its prey hallucinating reaching towards nothing before going into a light state of unconsciousness   you will never lose me bryech began strength flooding back into his body   if i cant run to you ill walk he whispered his voice gaining volume as he spoke   if i cant walk to you i will crawl he grabbed the dagger in his side   i will do whatever it takes to come back to you he said the wall between the real world and his vision blurred beyond all recognition   i will come back to you my love i swear to you all you have to do is ask bryech said as he kissed his beloved before he woke   the mordok crept closer to the wounded ulven savoring the easy kill bryech saw a dagger in his blood covered hands and he saw the shadow of the mordok growing closer bryech lunged upward grabbing the mordok by the shoulder and headbutting it in one fluid motion he pulled the dagger from his side and drove it repeatedly into the beasts throat watching it fall to the ground bryech sat on its chest to pin its arms with his knees bryech began slowly and heavily punching the mordok with his right hand each strike gaining more speed and ferocity bryech stopped after the beast stopped making noise   pulling off his helmet bryech looked before him seeing a large gathering of mordok before him bryech grabbed his sword and stood slowly a shocking amount of blood continuing to soak his clothing and drip down his body letting out a roar bryech was shocked to hear far more volume than he anticipated and turned to see a group of warriors rush past him to engage the mordok bryech fell to his knees a surprising relief sweeping over him two warriors from the warpack came and assisted him to safety    slowly but surely the mordok gained the upper hand warriors fell on both sides of dorn his axe continued to find its mark as it splintered shields and crushed bone arrows continue to bounce off his heavier armor until one found its way through into his leg he grimaced in pain as he was able to pull it out this took a moment he did not have and as he was doing this the mordok pushed the shield wall past him leaving him behind the enemy line mordok surrounded him and began to encroach on him and another arrow struck him in the chest luckily it didnt penetrate deep enough to actually pierce his skin one mordok recklessly pushed forward dorn dispatched it with some difficulty the nearly constant fighting and the very armor that protected him from blades and arrows was severely wearing him down this time two mordok came at him and he swung his axe into the skull of one of them but it got stuck the second mordok jumped on dorns back and began trying to bite through his pauldron dorn drew his sword and stabbed it through the back of the first mordok spun it around and then threw it to the ground he grabbed the arm of the mordok on his back and flipped it over his shoulder and onto his sword which was protruding from the first mordok exhausted dorn stood back up and freed his axe from the dead mordoks skull with a sickening crunch he squared up and hefted his axe ready to fight again when a black orb of energy smashed him in the ribs boring through and ripping flesh and muscle from his body dorn gasped for breath the pain was unbearable he could feel the life draining out of him but he managed to stay conscious somehow he dropped his axe when he reeled from the pain of the magic it was a few feet away from him and he couldnt reach it quickly a creeping blackness threatened to push dorn to unconsciousness with a vicious roar dorn howled in rage and with all the strength he could muster he got to his feet and charged the spellcasting mordok it must have thought dorn was out of the fight and it had turned to face the ulven shield wall and dorn tackled it from behind he dragged the stunned mordok down to the ground and beat it to death with his gauntleted fist his fury running out he finally lost consciousness and blacked out   everything was going wrong the lines werent holding the longfangs couldnt be everywhere at once the mordok were surrounding the ulven and the warpack wasnt holding the longfangs were trying to stay together and survive but it wasnt going well they became separated they had to for survival the forest was thick in this area and fritha used it to her advantage she used the trees to dodge and separate mordok coming behind them and hitting them in any way possible to incapacitate them slicing their throats and barely registering the gargling of their blood spilling down their neck as she was on to the next one she tried to stay close to her mate when she could with all of her armor and years of training with the longfangs it wasnt enough swords maces and flails found their way past her defenses and were wearing on her armor pieces of it were being destroyed beyond repair and then the metal was finding flesh her movements were slowing down her reactions werent enough an arrow sunk into her left leg she staggered from the pain fritha knew it cant stay in if she lost her ability to move she would be dead that much quicker she gripped the arrow hard and broke the shaft shoving it the rest of the way through her leg and rips out the blood stained arrow when she turned a mordok was running straight at her with an ax she braced herself and when he met her in combat she parried the blade and used the edge of her shield to dent the side of its skull in she didnt see the mordok to her right who charged right into her slamming her off her feet and into the base of a tree he lined up a javelin and pierced it in frithas upper thigh of her right leg she screams in pain and thrand hears her nearby he launched himself over a fallen tree and brought his long axe down hard and split the mordok to his collar bone   ripping the axe out with a crunch and quickly setting it down thrand pulled out his healing kit and worked to staunch the bleeding on frithas leg she was getting dizzy from the exhaustion and loss of blood he finished up treating her leg just enough to keep it from bleeding out and they look at each other they are in in a bad situation but they are there together thrand stood up and reached out to help fritha back onto her feet he was right in front of her and then suddenly he wasnt there was a loud clang of metal on metal thrand was gone and in his place was a mordok with a bloodied axe thrand was on the ground beneath it blood pooling from his head and face fritha picked up her sword and ran it through the mordoks chest with a scream of rage twisting the blade and shoving into it with her shoulder it fell down blood pouring from its vicious wound racing to his side fritha quickly called out a prayer to gaia to help save her mate tears welled up in frithas eyes as she tried to roll him over but she was scared at what she might see when she did there was so much blood with a groan thrand looked at her with one blood soaked eye and gasped for air he was alive but just barely and without immediate aid the axe wound to his face would surely kill him too wounded to continue any real fighting fritha pulled thrands dead weight across the ground to get him away from the fighting grimacing through the pain in her leg   this is just like pyre hills brynja thought to herself everywhere she turned there seemed to be another gap in their line another of her packmates being struck and bloodied another mordok to press their advantage brynja had seen death before she had stared it in the eyes and snarled until it backed down this time however it seemed there would be no escape   a hulking beast approached brynja tossing a smaller mordok aside with a swing of its axe brynja noted that the axe was nearly as big as she was before she could begin her next thought the axe was falling towards her as apparently the mordok was also fast unable to respond in time the blow caught her shield and nearly tore it from her hand her axe shot out and responded to the attack with one of her own another blow another strike with each swing of the mordoks axe brynja could feel her grip on her shield weaken she knew that being cautious like this would only get her killed sooner so she pressed her attack another swing and her shield was splintered though she pressed into the mordok and cut a deep gash in its thigh another swing and she knew her armor was spent but her axe found its way into the mordoks shoulder a final swing caught brynja in her calf bringing her to her knees in front of her attacker trading blows worked out for the mordok who now had the upper hand sensing an easy kill the mordok hefted its great axe high ready to bring the weapon down on brynja   this is how i die brynja couldnt keep the thought from her mind after all the battles ive fought after all the victories ive won after all the times ive spat in deaths face this is how it ends her mind wandered in that instant she thought of her home in clan axhound and of the welcoming arms of pack blackpaw she thought of the swamp of the corruption which nearly ended her life and of manethos disapproving lectures she thought of her new family her packmates in pack longfang she thought of naveeve and how    naveeve   brynjas mind stopped she had made a promise to her mate before leaving on this hunt naveeve would wait for her to return and brynja would find her way home her eyes grew hot and stung with tears but she didnt seem to notice all brynja could see was red brynja roared ferociously and launched herself up using her body to pivot and bring her axe up into the mordoks stomach kicking the beast down with her good leg she hefted the axe and brought it down with a mighty blow and caved in its chest as the mordoks labored breath gurgled through its now exposed lungs brynja staggered to the ground and grimaced from her numerous wounds   moving forward and swinging his axe in a wide arc to keep the mordok at bay halvar stepped forward to try to help brynja it would only buy them a few seconds of time but he knew brynja needed help if she flew into a furious rage right now she may cut down some mordok but halvar was afraid they would be overrun the mordok knew this too and several of them rushed halvar grunting with effort and swinging hard his long axe landed on the handle of the weapon of one of the rushing mordok and sent it reeling backwards and off balance the second one charged even faster and before he could recover his axe it was on him landing a heavy shoulder and pushing hard the mordok took halvar off his feet and crashing into the ground suddenly halvar noticed he was at a fatal disadvantage when he noticed the mordok also had a short wicked looking dagger in its hand it darted the weapon out several times and made shallow but still painful stabs at his chest and arms halvar reached for the knife in an attempt to control it his long axe now useless in a grapple when the mordok dropped its body weight onto his chest and pinned his arm for a moment it took advantage of halvar being trapped to slice out with the knife cutting into his face it was not a fast and clean cut but instead a tearing wound that was forcefully opened by pushing a pitted and rusty blade across exposed flesh blood gushed out from the deep and jagged cut and he shot his forearm up to protect his face and throat the knife cut again this time glancing off the heavy leather gauntlet as the mordok was lining up another stab this time aimed towards halvars face there was a sudden thump and the mordok went flying backwards halvar couldnt see well with the blood in his eyes and he was cut and bleeding from numerous places stepping in to engage the mordok was runa even though his eyes were blood soaked her enormous hammer unmistakable this gave halvar a moment to crawl away holding his face from the grievous wound and move towards brynja to help her get away from danger   the two mordok surrounded runa one wound up and swung a flail wrapping around runas forearm tightly the spikes tore through her armor and skin as the mordok pulled back exposing bone and ripping muscle the hammer fell from her hand which opened the opportunity for the mordok to bring up its shield and pin her arm to the tree behind her the force of the shield edge ramming her into the tree snapped the bone of her upper arm growling through gritted teeth and pain runa reached behind her for her sax in this moment thrand and bryechs teachings of keeping weapons close to hand and carrying an extra knife shot into her mind she pulled the knife clear of its sheath and shoved it up the mordoks jowl hilt deep its eyes went wide and blood oozed out of its gaped mouth she yanked it out and the mordok fell at her feet thrashing from the pain of the knife feeling the pain radiating from her arm she looked down at the mordoks body overcome with rage she picked the hammer up with her good arm and swung it over and over again until there is nothing left of its face with one last kick to its body she stomped off in the swirl of the melee to find the rest of her pack clutching her now dangling broken arm   chaos utter chaos surrounded them left and right no matter where throm looked he witnessed carnage and death before him friend and foe alike bled out and colored the soaked the ground in crimson ulven warriors fought for their life mordok fought for their life ferocity and blood lust gripped this entire battle as both sides knew that only one side was walking away from this alive   two mordok came around and started towards their rear flank where they were already being pressed throm rushed forward blindly knowing that if any more pressure was applied to that side of their warpack they would fall as he got close he felt something slam into his left leg he stumbled and looked down and saw a crude arrow puncturing his tasset and it filled him with burning agony he stood up and grabbed a dead mordok on the way up with all his might he held it up and stumbled towards them as he used the body as a shield from their arrows several arrows slammed into the corpse he felt another arrow this time and it hit him hard in the kidney he roared with agony and hobbled on the best he could the corpse was hit again and again as he held it there for a moment against his shoulder throm was in a bind but he couldnt give up if he did the rear defense would crumble he couldnt give in no matter what   his mind wandered back to a speech that was given to the hellhound warpack all those years ago in the war against the colonists   let loose give in and be a fang once more there is no mercy only death now roar howl and maul   his eyes narrowed and with his fangs bared throm howled to the sky the mordok only stopped for a single moment in confusion a moment long enough for throm to start his onslaught in that one moment throm rushed in with the arrowriddled body throwing it at one of the others with a bow a skirmishing mordok came from the brush and started at him with two knives in mere moments his armor was in tatters and his arm bleeding like a stuck boar he felt himself going down down into the void that was death then he felt it his soul scream in denial his blood lust boiled over into pure rage if these beasts would take him down today they are going to have to earn it and they will have to endure his fury   in a final effort throm stood up and bellowed like never before his booming voice shook the very woods and warriors from both sides gave pause and looked at him in surprise blood poured from multiple wounds several arrows protruded from his body his eyes wide and filled with rage throm took up his mace and barreled forward and began to bludgeon one of the mordok without mercy without finesse or form blood spattered up as the flanges of the mace tore and crushed more and more flesh the mordok screamed and crumbled beneath the blows and the two mordok nearest him scurried backwards in panic repeatedly the mace pulverized flesh and killed the mordok and ended its screams with a final roar that sent the panicked mordok near him fleeing away throms eyes rolled into the back of his head and he pitched backwards smashing into the ground a pool of blood began to form around him as his world turned to black   the veteran longfangs had been in the thick of the combat and exacted a heavy toll on the mordok the dead had piled up around them and blood had been washed or pooled everywhere but this close in and vicious fighting had a cost as equipment was rent blood was spilled and bones were broken even the veterans of pack longfang could not hold out forever   gruinar fellriver chieftain of pack fellriver of clan grimward took a moment to survey the battlefield when he heard final howl of rage from throm nightriver everything happened so fast their warpack was doing well moving through the great forest and skirmishing the mordok then they were beset upon by an enormous force of mordok and he was sure to be judged by the great wolf that day he was honored to die in battle on this glorious hunt but he was sad that he would never see his mate and his two daughters ever again   however instead of a swift crush of gnashing teeth and weapons that would fell his smaller warpack his forces were joined by another group of ulven they fought with tenacity and skill and took on mordok numbers larger than their own gruinars warpack was not torn down by the mordok but instead started to hold their own his warriors fell in choking spasms of blood and final battle cries on their lips but they fought like hell as they died then the battle began to shift and they began to push back against the mordok   when gruinar surveyed the battlefield he saw the terribly wounded warriors with flags on their belts it was a large curved and angular white fang the banner of the pack longfang the chieftain audibly chuckled in irony the last time he had seen those flags were on the elite ulfhednar of pack longfang during the civil war he was not a chieftain at that time he was assigned to a pack that was pressing and pushing to get into and take the final settlement of clan stormjarl during the battle of blackwolf creek one of the warriors had taken off their helmet and gruinar was shocked to see bryech savagefang one of the few and only survivors of that battle he recognized him he was there when clan grimward warriors cut him down and left him to die in a pool of his blood and yet here he is alongside his packmates defending gruinars warpack from being massacred how times have changed indeed thought the chieftain as he slammed his axe to his shield   grimward warriors charge cut them down and send them to the great wolf gruinar roared as he led the final charge into the mordok his warriors pushed themselves despite wounds exhaustion and casualties and battered into the mordok group   it was over quickly the damage inflicted by the longfang warriors and the time they bought by holding out and enduring the mordok assault gave the chieftains warpack a chance to recover and then deal the final blow   dead bloodied and wounded lay everywhere this was a vicious and brutal fight some of the more able bodied grimward warriors had assembled the longfang warriors in a group shockingly none had died in the fight judging by their wounds they should have   i am chieftain gruinar fellriver of clan grimward said the chieftain in an authoritative tone   some of the longfang warriors worriedly glanced to each other after they learned the origin of the warpack they rushed to help a few inched towards their weapons or hands moved towards sheathed knifes and a fierceness began to creep back into the bloodied eyes of a few of those still conscious   i am honored to have fought alongside you this day said the chieftain after taking a moment to size them up   he extended an arm out to them offering it for a forearm clasp    end somewhere on a back street a short walk from a new hope market square there is a tavern room it had always been an unassuming room small sparse and a little dark but soon it would become the room where it all happened it had been months hold up in this lantern lit tavern room surrounded by drying herbs pipe ash and stacks and stacks of ink stained notes but cordyn was finally edging close to a breakthrough all the long restless days would finally be worth it when he managed to crack the recipe  months prior cordyn arrived in new hope with the intention of spending the winter surrounded by civilization and whatever work he could scrap together he had a small amount of coin saved up as well as some reagents he collected on his travels southward from the great wolfs hackles and the fields surrounding the archons spire with his knack for potion work he wasnt worried about making a living things had a habit of working out for cordyn he was never really sure why but he found that when he put himself out there things just fell in place after finding a room at a local tavern cordyn mixed up a small sampler of potions and took to the nearby market square to secure some work it wasnt long before he stumbled across a struggling overworked alchemist he was an older man who had clearly been around for a while and had drummed up a consistent level of business that he was desperately trying to keep up with after a short conversation they agreed on a business relationship the alchemist would supply him with reagents and then buy back completed potions at a reduced wholesale price cordyn would have definitely made more money selling potions on his own but he liked the idea of being able to pull up stakes when he wanted to and a shop of his own would have felt more like a shackle than anything either way he made enough money to cover room and board and still have a little on the side to put away things went very well for a few weeks until one day cordyn set his pipe too close to some dried herbs and they quickly went up in flames there was no way the alchemist would resupply cordyn for one of his own mistakes and though the thought of lost coin hurt his heart as well as his purse he resolved to head down to an herbalist himself and replace the lost reagents  the door was heavy and the room smelled of dried flowers and potpourri and a large burly man stood behind a counter were it not for the racks upon racks of herbs cordyn would have sworn he accidentally walked into a blacksmith quietly and thoughtfully cordyn picked through the racks placing the replacement herbs into a bag it wasnt until he walked up to the counter that he saw it far in the back room behind the burly herbalist was a fantastic dusty library cordyns eyes lit up as his gaze fell past the herbalist and onto the leather bound tomes the shopkeeper found his excitement endearing and with little push agreed to let cordyn peruse his expansive collection cordyn pushed his way past the large man and sat at the floor pulling book after book off the shelf to leaf through the majority of the herbal properties were already known to him through his alchemical research and training however one word appeared a few times that he had not encountered before hey shopkeep cordyn called out inquisitively whats an aphrodisiac out of reflex the shopkeeper laughed a bit but quickly he pulled himself together  well its an herb or powder something you eat either way that puts you in the mood and puts some power in your loins between you and me none of them really work but that doesnt stop people from dropping some serious coin on a hope that they will i get runners for new hope nobles in here weekly loading up on this or that for their respective employers sexual potency ill tell ya boy whoever does figure out a real aphrodisiac will find himself a rich man cordyn smiled from ear to ear and hurriedly gathered up a sack of reagents from around the shop  tell ya what shopkeep when im that rich man ill buy you a drink the shopkeeper called to cordyn as he spilled out of the store id lose a lot of business if you do youd better make it a bottle boy he chuckled rubbing his temples  over the next few months cordyn continued his alchemical work but with all of his spare time he worked to develop and perfect his new potion hed worked out a deal with an older homeless beggar in return for testing his potions cordyn would buy the old man a meal and a stiff drink at the tavern the beggar didnt ask what these concoctions were supposed to do he just jumped at the chance for a hot meal it was for the best this way the last thing cordyn needed was a placebo the testing needed to be blind or he may well end up with just another wannabe aphrodisiac for months they continued in their standard fashion and everything was working out well jimmy the beggar was well fed and cordyn inched closer to a breakthrough other than a short vacation to escort gwynevive to iron mound so she could reconnect with her phoenix family cordyn worked tirelessly one afternoon after hours of distilling and grinding cordyn poured a crystallized powder into his working dish after a few seconds the once clear liquid hed been toying with took on a milky purple appearance this was it cordyn could feel it he tore downstairs and threw open the front door to the tavern calling out for his assistant jimmy this is it hurry the elderly beggar made his way toward the tavern door in no apparent rush calm down boyo lets get some stew in a bowl no no jimmy this is it potion first then stew the beggar grumbled and took the potion from cordyn alright just give it here jimmy grimaced at the sight of the potion and downed it in a single swallow well at least it doesnt taste so bad cordyn stared at the man with eager eyes well well its not doing anyth wait jimmys eyes widened and he quickly moved to grab between his legs by the fucking grace of arnath boyo i havent felt the call in years forget the stew i need a whore cordyn jumped and laughed in excitement and with trembling hands dug his coin purse out of a pouch and placed some coins in jimmys hand should be enough for the night my man jimmy clasped his hand over the coins and tore out of the tavern whooping and skipping still trembling with excitement cordyn turned to the bar placing a few coins on the counter give me a bottle of whiskey please i have an herbalist to visit as he stepped out into the spring sun cordyn finally began to calm down he sighed contentedly and mused well it was a winter well spent read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1844storycodyixzz5gbijtjyvharkov made his way slowly down the southern end of the hackles the trails were either covered in snow or too unstable to traverse he was allowed to return to starkhaven a month ago but the heart of winter had been deadly cold making travel difficult especially in the mountains he had lost at least ten pounds since he left starkhaven six months ago for his eagle trial the only reason he had survived was due to the skills he had learned with the order his skills as an archer and a healer kept him healthy and his skills as a laborer kept him slightly more comfortable the mountains were not empty of predators either mountain lions and wolves the occasional bear or mordok he had used his sword as much as he used his skills the last six months had been trying not only for harkov as an individual but also as a member of the order there had been numerous other initiates in the mountains at the same time as harkov some were eagles like harkov others were young soon to be lions each cleric must do this trial alone you can help each other for a short while but each initiate must go his own way he had seen several of his comrades dead some from starvation or sickness others from being killed harkov was happy he didnt know by what because the scenes were gruesome the winter was the hardest time for trials to happen even if you start in the summer harkov found a small clearing on a natural ledge and stopped to get his bearing beneath him he could see starkhaven the mighty fortress looked small almost dwarfed next to the massive yurnai lake the sight filled him with relief he remembered this view from six months ago when he first left the trail was well kept from here on out harkov made a signal arrow and started a small fire once the fire was stable he lit the arrow and fired it into the sky this was the signal to let the settlement know that a cleric had come back not as a neophyte but as a fullfledged eagle harkov waited for a few moments before hearing the long loud moan of a signal horn he smiled they had seen his signal he turned and ran down the path mantling fallen trees and slipping and sliding down icy covered pathways this was it the day he had dreamed of for so long was finally here an hour later harkov came into view of the gate having fallen a considerable distance of the way down after slipping on a patch of ice he was sore and relieved to finally be home he was excited to see his friends again and to sleep in a real bed mostly though he looked forward to earning his title they said most cried harkov couldnt see how this was too exciting as he drew near the rear gate to starkhaven began to open even though it was just one of several secondary gates into the territory of starkhaven it was quite impressive as the gate opened harkov slowly saw familiar faces first were his friends ventaris basil suunalla captain ree oliver dom he smiled as he saw them but was slightly taken aback when he saw his family his mother was already crying and his brother was getting teary as well a slight distance behind them harkov saw his father as well who had a look that gave away only one emotion pride harkov was swept with emotion but recollected himself and held his bearing with a serious demeanor he walked forward past the gate and to either side of him was a gathering of countless clerics of arnath standing in the center of the half circle formed by the crowd was his mentor and friend gryphon cullen with his ceremonial sword the crowd was dead silent as the young warrior before them approached the ceremony that many of them had witnessed was as old as time itself to some of those gathered the importance was not lost on them he walked confidently shoulders rolled back his armor looked wellworn and battle tested though his helm cut off a significant amount of his view he could see his mentor clearly before him as he stopped about an arms reach in front of him there was a pause for a time the silence was almost deafening kneel the young mans mentor said in a ceremonial tone harkov did as was commanded drawing his sword and driving it into the ground in front of him the sound of metal sinking into the earth was beautiful to harkov gryphon cullen brought his sword down slowly blade facing his student first to his right then twisting the blade so the flat was facing the ground and touching it to each of his pupils shoulders for valor in battle for honor in service i james cullen raise you stand warrior of arnath harkov stood and for a moment looked at his sword still stuck in the ground harkov grasped the hilt and pulled with every ounce of strength he had to brandish his blade high in the air before letting out a scream of victory the small crowd gave out a cheer and his family rushed to greet him the next few days were a blur as harkov and his friends and family celebrated his lifes ambition had finally come to fruition he was a warrior that was everything he wanted wasnt itwith new hopes grand road being constructed many cheap inns and taverns have popped up all over the country side although many were hastily made most of them have all the comforts of home however this story doesnt take place in one of these new freshly painted inns this one finds its start just outside of an older inn this inn has seen far better days its paint was chipped its windows didnt close all the way its door creaked loudly when someone walked in as did its floor hell the list goes on and on however even with its laundry list of problems it boasted fair prices for a room and meals it was these prices that caught the attention of wren duncan wren duncan a younger female human with long amber hair she was dressed in wellworn traveling clothes a short sword on her side and a bag on her back that was weighed down with something that jingled with every step she also was wearing a large cloak to hide all the cuts and bruises she had within her coin pouch she had a modest amount of silver she was paid this modest amount for her help at riverhead sadly for her in doing so she shredded her armor a lighter chainmail she had bought only the month before it now had missing rings and long rips making it unusable it weighed her bag down on her back she could fix it if she could find a forge to make new rings for it she had many new battle wounds as well every painful step was a reminder of what had happened as she thought about it flashes of the battle would come and go she would see a smaller heavily armored mordok from time to time this one and the others that looked like it destroyed her armor and gave her many deep cuts on her arms and one deep gash on her left leg other times it was the mordok shaman this one did nothing to her while it blew up other shields and went after the others in the shield line however during its last moments it singled her out and threw a death bolt at her leg she had almost jumped it but sadly it struck her in the foot this bolt almost blew her foot right off thankfully she was pulled from the line and healed well enough to get back on the line even after the shaman she wasnt done getting hurt she tried to play it a bit safer and help the rear line it was there that another mordok gave her another wound the mordok shot her with its bow and without a shield she had little chance to block with all her already inflicted wounds she couldnt move like she normally could otherwise she was sure she could have dodged it this one went into her other still hurting arm after that last wound the battle lasted a bit longer and the mordok were pushed back all in all not that great of a battle for her she was then paid and sent on her way even worse for her was that this fair pay wasnt enough to repair her armor patch her up and put a temporary roof over her head she was only paid enough for one of these things armor could be patched up later and wounds would heal but sleeping outside even close to the road could lead to getting robbed or worsedeath so she found her way to one of the cheaper inns close to new hope this inn was an older looking one it had a rundown look to it the windows were a bit drafty the roof had a leak near the back corner of the bar and whole place had a faint musty smell to it most likely from the leak however even with its faults its food was pretty good and its rooms were warm the owner of the inn was an older human male named james banding he had short gray hair with gray stubble he gave her a good deal for a weeks stay the cost also included food and drink but not alcoholic drinks all he asked was she didnt cause any trouble she knew this was going to be easy as she didnt want to interact with anyone so long as they left her alone she knew she would be fine she paid to stay in this inn for the week in that week she stayed to herself most of her time was spent nursing her wounds as well as watching the inns travelers come and go the travelers were a mix of humans and ulven most of them workers hired to work on new hopes grand road they kept to themselves and most of them didnt try to talk to her the few that did were drunk and as they tried to talk her up they were met with an emotionless stare little if any words and under the table she would quarter draw her short sword from there they would leave and she would sheath her blade she didnt want to talk to any of them she was in pain from her wounds and had no desire to be picked up by any of these drunks james took note of this and made sure to keep the workers away from her it wasnt until the last day of her week that anything of note happened the day began like any other she changed her bandages washed up came down from her room and ordered breakfast from james from there she watched the many groups leave to work on the road about midday a heavy downpour began this downpour halted the work on the road the workers were sent home with the day off they used this day off to get an early start to drinking wren left her seat at the bar and moved to a table in the far corner of the inns bar hoping the leak in the roof would deter the drunks from trying to chat with her about an hour into the drinking the door to the inn opened and a thin man wearing a heavy traveling cloak walked in he took a few steps in lowered the hood of his cloak and looked around the inns bar with the hood off she could tell that the man was a syndar his short brown hair was mostly dry despite the heavy rains his green eyes looked around the tavern as if he was looking for someone after a few seconds of looking around the tavern his eyes found her and a few moments later he began to walk to her table as he did her hand went straight to her sword at her side when he made it to her table he asked miss duncan she looked up at him and nodded she wondered how he knew her name and why he was looking for her all the while not taking her eyes off him the syndar then reached for his pouch and pulled out a single letter miss duncan i have a letter for you from the commander of the rangers he said he put the letter down in front of her turned and walked out on his way out wren swore she heard him mutter what the hells wrong with that human under his breath but she could have misheard him it wasnt long after he had left that she took her hand off her sword she then slowly opened the letter it was a simple folded parchment closed with green wax the wax was sealed with the letter r she opened it with a small knife inside was a short message to wren duncan i was told you were one of the defenders at the battle for riverhead i was also informed that you are not with any of the known factions that were there to defend them im curious as to why you were there if it is something as simple as coin if you are trying to make a name for yourself or maybe you dont even know yourself i could help you with one of these or more if youre interested then make your way to crows landing and we can speak more on this matter tobias delgreen commander of the rangers she read the letter a few times not really knowing what to think she knew why she had gone to riverhead they needed help and she could use the coin it was as simple as that the offer however did interest her she had heard a few things about the rangers people had been talking about the hooded men and women of the crows landing settlement things like their talent for finding lost things in the woods their willingness to help where they could and also their hatred for bandits she had also heard a few bad things about them as well but she didnt have a lot of other options at the moment her leg and side werent getting any better and she had no way to pay for the wounds at the very least she might be able to get some paid work from this ranger that and she no longer had enough silver to stay in this inn she gathered her things from her room and dropped off the key to james pulling her cloak closer around her she made her way out into the rain before she made it all the way out the door james was at her side with a small bag he handed it to her saying heres some food for the road and something for your wounds she thanked him and began again every step she took was a painful one her leg was badly infected as was her side however lucky for her crows landing was only two days away from the inn she was staying at also the road from her to it was already done so at least it should be an easy walk she thought it was about midday when she started to realize she needed a walking stick however she was in a wide open plain without any trees in site a few hours later as the sun started to set she saw a forest off in the distance this forest meant she was about a fourth of the way to crows landing her wounds had slowed her down a lot more than she had first thought they would she walked a few yards into the now much darker looking forest with one hand on her sword she looked for a young enough sapling that she could use a few more yards and she found a young ash sapling that would do the job she drew her sword and with a few hard swings she had her stick she cut off the branches and eyed her work it was about this time when she heard a snap off in the darker parts of the forest holding her sword out in front of herself she spun around trying to see where the sound came from all the while cursing herself for coming into the woods without armor or a light stupid stupid stupid she muttered under her breath not seeing where the sound came from with one hand tightly gripping her sword and the other holding her new walking stick as fast as her wounds would allow her to she made her way out of the forest and away from the ensuing danger all the while not seeing or hearing whatever made the noise a few panicked minutes went by as she got back to the road once on the road and with a few miles between her and the forest she finally put her sword away breathing heavily she pulled her cloak closer to her body in attempt to keep warm night was getting closer and she was dead tired she found a decent opening a few yards off the path and was starting to find the driest spot she could after a bit of shifting around rocks sticks and leaves she made a small shelter leaning her walking stick against the side of the shelter and setting her bag of broken armor down she lied down to rest even with the storm raging on her eyes felt heavy and it wasnt long before she fell into an uneasy sleep she awoke a while later to immense pain from her leg with much care she moved her leg up so she could see the bandage she saw the bandage was now a dark brown and was giving off a bad smell she slowly removed the bandage to put on another the act of pulling the old one off hurt more than when she first got it with the bandage now off she was able to easily see how infected it had gotten looking down at her cut she wondered what she could do she still had over a days walk on the road and there was no way she was going to make it with her leg this bad biting down on her lip she reached for her bag and felt around for another bandage she then felt the bag that james gave her she had forgotten all about it until now pulling it out and looking through what he had gifted her with she found thicker bandages with some kind of grease on it some hard tack and a small bottle of something judging by the smell it was something hard painfully smiling to herself she knew what she had to do she arranged her healers kit and using her knife she cut into her wound the pain was too much and she had to stop breathing hard she knew things would only get worse she drank a bit of the bottle it was rancid bit down on a bit of her cloak and cut away at it again sweat dripped off her forehead she managed to get most of the in her mind infected bits off putting her knife back she poured the rest of the bottle onto the now open wound even through the thick cloak an audible scream could be heard working through the pain she wrapped the cut with the new bandages with this done she went limp breathing hard she waited for the pain to go away or at least lessen a few moments went by and the pain did start to subside she didnt know if it was from getting cleaned or the rancid drink but that didnt matter she needed to get to crows landing with the help of her walking stick she began to head out again she couldnt move her leg at all and it was only because of her stick that she was able to walk at all her speed was minuscule thankfully the storm was letting up a bit the rain was still falling but it was no longer obstructing her view of the road she still felt dead tired and wanted nothing more than to fall into a warm bed she limped on and a few more hours went by sweat kept dripping from her and she knew normally she wouldnt have been this exhausted she looked to her bandaged leg and saw that it was red with her blood breathing heavily she limped ever faster a few more hours of pain and a red tunnel soon took over her vision she got a few more steps before falling hitting the ground hard she tried to crawl but her body had given her more than it had soon the red vision turned black when she came to she was no longer out on the road she was in a mostly white room full of beds as she looked around she saw two humans one male the other female and an ulven the female had a white shirt with a green vest over it she was shorter with shoulder length dark brown hair the human male was of average height with short light brown hair he was wearing a short sleeve hooded tunic the male ulven was also of average height had short dark brown hair and a scar going down his left eye he was wearing a long leather sleeveless coat with a green hooded tunic the two humans were quietly meditating the ulven was just standing nearby as if he was watching over them her movement didnt go unnoticed and the ulven shifted his gaze from the two meditating to herself good afternoon miss duncan i trust you are feeling better before she could reply the two humans got up the female spoke first she is all healed up as are we ill help puckerman back to his house the other human she was guessing puckerman replied clearly annoyed i dont need help kathena i can make it home just fine after he said this he started to limp away she could tell there was something really wrong with his leg but before she could get a good look at it kathena got up next to him and forcefully helped him to his house with them gone it was just her and the ulven for a few moments he just looked out in the direction that puckerman and kathena went after a bit he spoke again miss duncan how are you feeling as he said this he looked at her and seeing his eyes she began to glare at him after a bit he seemed to notice and spoke again i know my eyes are a bit strange but they only just started to change colors she then looked away realizing he wasnt a threat i got your letter she finally replied and on the way here you got attacked by he asked no these are from the battle back in riverhead she replied really so thats why they were so infected why didnt you get them healed he said she didnt reply to that and simply looked around for her things he picked up on that and said if you dont want to stay your things are in front of this bed however i hope you would give my offer some thought whats your offer she asked you would have died out on the road were it not for my guards they found you while patrolling and weve also healed you up full i know you are kind of a mercenary so what would you say this is worth to you and know that we would keep doing this for you you would have a home and people to fight alongside you he said she thought on it for a bit and said as payment for what youve done ill stay on as a ranger merc for 6 months after that well talk again as to if ill stay sounds good your belt flag is in your bag next to your armor you should stop by uncle ishvans hes our blacksmith after that when you feel up to it ill show you to guthrum he is the merc elder hell be the one to show you the ropes also next month we will be storming davins reach welcome to the rangers and welcome to crows landing he said this as he turned and walked out not long after he left she looked under the covers at where her wounds were she was shocked to see not even scars all she found was fresh pink skin the healers did a great job and soon after she tried standing as she got out of bed she walked around to the other side to see her bag she then saw her clothes from the road someone had washed them clean of the road and her blood grabbing them she found an empty room and changed back into her clothes her mind kept thinking about how things had changed and if this was going to be the right choice picking up her broken chainmail again she made her way out of the hospital once outside she was greeted to a bustling town everywhere she looked there were people moving around and they all seemed to be in a great mood she then headed off into town she had a new place to explore and armor to fix read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1809timstorypostedwikiixzz5bbi7irhpafter the siege of davens reach i was trudging through a thunderstorm on my way home after giving away the last of my silver to bandits that had lost their way after my extended life ive seen humans do far worse things to put food on the table but this story isnt about davens reach or what happened on the way home those stories are for a different day as i returned to my homestead in darkport i immediately began drawing myself a bath as i had been drenched by the downpour and had no way of getting clean until i got home i had talked to the sailors tribunal and announced to them of my wish to officially become a diplomat of darkport since itll take me some time to fully become their leader the syndar leader nathaniel was not present and they informed me of their decision when he returns i returned to my homestead to prepare for the next big adventure the next day is where the magic will begin and when i will assume the highest title in my tribe its a title that very few members of the wolfgang tribe had attained in the lifetime of this tribe it is one of the highest honors to receive and it is something not given out lightly only syndar that have not only proven their worth for their people but also make grave sacrifices gain this title i arise from slumber like a normal day i wake up make some breakfast for me and my daughter and do some meditation however instead of a cheery child like normal i am greeted by a sad and gloomy girl that only looks like my child i had thought nothing of it as it could just be her time of the month or something the rest of this story will be told as if it was happening in real time naxala father what are your plans for today dad i dont know hun probably some light meditation and i might go out to the spire and talk with vazra n ohi see well for today can you stay in darkport some of the members of the tribe have a gift for you ok ill stay for today only because you asked you also seem sad is something wrong no nothings wrongim fine just my time of the month i suppose i then finish my breakfast and clean up the plates i spend part of the day talking to some syndar from fawyth about some old projects that were left on the old world and how itll be nice to go back there and reclaim them i am then approached by my adviser allon bowstar meister talonflame a word in private certainly bowstar what is it i need you to come to my home here in darkport the members of wolfgang have set up something special for you since you were away on your birthday  ill gladly go even though there is no need to celebrate my birth its quite unnecessary what time should i show up arrive when the sun and the moon are both present in the sky i then return to my home to prepare for the nights festivities as i know that when my tribe plans something its usually going to be big i decide to put on my tribal attire as i know some members of my tribe arent as regal as i am later that evening i arrive to bowstars place the candlelight is quite dim for it to be a party i walk in and immediately i am knocked out bagged and dragged to some unknown place i am then awoken by a rush of water hitting my face the first thing i notice is that i am bound like an offering arms and legs spread apart on a stone slab i later realize this to be some sort of altar but it was destroyed after the ritual so i had no time to study it around me i see 15 dimmed out candles and i smell the burning of lavender and sage is this some kind of ritual unbind me let me free a robbed figure came up to me calm down father what we offer to you is a gift for what you have done and for what you face on our behalf why must i be bound like some sacrifice because what we offer you your body will reject even though your mind may be willing you are much too powerful for us to test your connection to your bodys will to control it she then utters a few words that initiates the ritual all members in that room began chanting the mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom and his tongue shall declare judgment blessed is he who endureth temptation for once and twice he hath been tested he shall receive the crown of life oh kuriki lord of darkness oh eagle  watcher of the sky oh how holy how serene how generous how pleasant this man who believeth oh pure azureal protect us from all threats and let your will be heard show us the will of the guardian of the blue flame it has been over a century since ive heard of these words and i have never once heard them to have them spoken about me is an honor although i wonder where on earth did they receive such words that was believed to be lost in time since the move to the sea they were chanting those words so much that the walls began to shake and those words began to burrow in my mind then a change in the drowning vocals my child comes up to me father i would like you to meditate into this and channel your energy to its core she places on top of my stomach my black orb of nothingness and i began channeling my energy into it as instructed i cant turn down my own child when she looks sad call it a weakness as my mana has depleted into this orb my child removes the orb from my stomach and begins to channel a bit of mana into me as she is reciting the chant then one by one each member of my tribe comes to me and channels some mana at first it didnt feel too bad but then my mind began to lose connection with my body as i am now becoming connected to each remaining member of the wolfgang tribe i watch as my body begins to contort and i appear as if i am in pain its like my body is rejecting the mana that is being poured within and i am looking at myself as the man on the altar is not me we then drain my mana again with the orb and the process continues until every member of my tribe has had their mana depleted into my now not moving body it felt like a dream but what happened was true and i may be a bit sedated on foreign mana and drugs as i wrote this but it would appear that i have become a guardian to my people i will cherish this gift for as long as my mortal body lives the orb i now carry represents what i was and my body represents what i am i know i am a man of many titles but the title of guardian supersedes all others guardian azureal talonflame of the blue flameharkov set towards the inner keep of starkhaven walking at his usual brisk pace the settlement was bustling workers and order members working on various projects most of them revolving around the refugees that traveled from new hope harkov had been working the last few weeks under his new assignment as an eagle initiate suu nalla was a different teacher than ventaris then again they both follow different paths in their service to arnath harkov was still angered by his reassignment everybody he asked said it had nothing to do with harkov just somebody up the chain made the decision for them oliver said the same thing when he denied harkov the name of the higher up who gave the transfer order saying that he was told that all of the answers he was looking for lie in the path of acceptance harkov wasnt even paying attention to where he was going he was too busy brooding he almost reached the doors of the library when he felt the recoil of running into another person harkovs release from his anger was almost instant he turned to see who he had hit and to his embarrassment saw that he had knocked over a young woman by arnath i am so sorry miss harkov said as he went to help her up no its okay it was probably just as much my fault the girl responded harkov reached out and gasped when his hands were suddenly enveloped in a warm silver glow the same one he had been learning to control  your hands are really oh my god the girl exclaimed as she finally looked up and saw harkovs hands harkov looked down at his hands and focused cutting off the flow of mana the glow faded slowly and then all at once harkov could feel the heat in his face he could feel it getting redder the girl looked at him she had blonde hair and blue eyes with flecks of green in them harkov gave her a quick once over before making eye contact she looked to be a few years younger than harkov was lean but clearly strong the kind of strength harkov recognized he couldnt quite tell how but he didnt question it they looked at each other for a moment in silence before she spoke up im isabella but my friends and family call me bella well isabella i am so sorry for knocking you over harkov replied still feeling the heat in his cheeks youre one of the order clerics bella asked looking back down at his hands sort of im an initiate set to be an eagle of the light harkov replied an eagle huh bella said giving him a once over of her own you might want to work on your awareness if you want to be an eagle her smile was a devilish one hinting at challenge before harkov could retort bella took off harkov watched her go dumbstruck at how bold she was and how fast she was harkov shook himself into focus and continued into the library the library was a vast and grand place filled with scrolls and thickly bound books containing untold amounts of knowledge still only a fraction of what had been on faedrun harkov wandered aimlessly for a while building the courage to try and bother one of the many griffons who were in charge of the collective works before he could do so though one such griffon beat him to the punch is there something i can help you with my boy asked a very old man who seemed to carry not a worry in the world he had a genuine smile his eyes were mere slits and his lips thin harkov doubted if this man was still able enough to understand where he was let alone help him find the books and scrolls he was searching for but harkov gave him the benefit of the doubt yes actually i was wondering if you could help me find a few texts harkov responded doubt obvious in his voice his tone was almost patronizing the old man shuffled past harkov with slow deliberate steps not once looking back as harkov stood there awkwardly waiting for a response well the old man said without looking backare you coming my boy harkov looked around the atrium trying to find anybody else to help but for some reason all the griffons except this old man had disappeared with a sigh and a shake of his head harkov jogged to catch up with the old griffon the path they took was slow going as the two walked up stairs and down hallways harkov almost couldnt comprehend how they fit this many into the keep dont you want to know what texts i was looking for i doubt theyll be up here harkov asked as they passed fewer and fewer bookshelves the old man waved a hand at him but didnt bother with words eventually they came to a halt just outside of a door to one the rooms on the top floor of the keep the area they were in was well lit with windows becoming far more frequent the higher they had gone the cool air of early spring caused harkov to shiver the old man stood at the door rattling a ring of keys trying several in an attempt to get the door open harkov began to bounce in place trying to warm himself his breath visible in the air like dragons breath harkov almost let out an audible sigh of relief when he heard the deep clunk of the lock as they walked into the room the old man began muttering to himself and started rummaging through an old chest at the foot of what harkov assumed was his bed harkov ignored him and began examining the room piles of books varying in height filled the room the room itself had a uniqueness to it the room formed a half circle with another half circle coming off of it creating a raised platform where a bed sat directly to the left of the original half circle was a large fireplace which was currently void of any fire or fuel a small stack of logs and a tinderbox sat neatly next to the fireplace and just to the right of the door was a small balcony that had a full view of starkhaven harkov heard a whistle and turned just in time to stop a small flint block from hitting him in the face though the catch wasnt clean and he bobbled it before securing it glaring at the old man start a fire lad its freezing in here the old man ordered as he sat down his age showing as he slowly lowered himself into his chair harkov set to the fire using a generous amount of tinder after a little too much effort a strong fire was burning in the pit harkov walked over and sat across from the old man well past the limit of his patience and glared at his compatriot i hope you didnt drag me up here to fulfill some sick fantasy old man because im not interested in that sort of thing harkov said in a combination of a snarl and a sneer he looked closer at the old man and saw a few scars on his timeworn face the griffon laughed much to harkovs annoyance listen son ive seen more war and bedded more women in my prime then you will in your lifetime so you can spare me the tough guy act said the old man opening his eyes wide and staring at harkov intensely harkov recoiled caught off guard by the bluntness of the response he laughed without realizing but stopped when the old man didnt harkov grew uncomfortable under the gaze of his elder it was almost like the man was peering into his very soul my name is james cullen and i know what you seek said james his gaze unwavering harkov laughed again and looked away dramatically before leaning forward in his seat something funny james asked this time with a much more relaxed tone no forgive me just confused is all harkov answered harkov looked at the floor and mulled over his thoughts for a bit before breaking the silence tell me then james what is it that i seek harkov asked not looking up from the floor you are curious about your place as an eagle james answered adjusting in his seat so he was more comfortable how did you well get there my boy james interrupted with a wave of his hand let me tell you why you are here son james said as his eyes seemed to dim and go somewhere far far away i chose you to revive something the order has been without for far too long harkov was silent not sure if he should ask what or just stay silent the fire now gave the room a comfortable warmth and filled it with a smokey smell that soothed harkov and allowed him to feel less defensive i am the last of a small sect of the eagles known as the war eagles we fulfilled a role that is much different from the traditional eagle james said a surprising intensity filling his eyes we were the perfect union of fury and honor we were heroes the great war was our golden age brother cullen what does this have to do with me harkov interrupted everything i want you to be the first of a new generation of war eagles james answered his tone intense ive seen you training i was the one who requested you to become an eagle james leaned forward and looked deep into harkovs eyes again seeming to look in his soul harkov returned the stare in kind pondering what to say this was a strange turn of events and harkov was not sure what to think let alone say harkov i want you to become my pupil to take up the mantel that only a brave few have ever held and eventually i want you to replace me as their leader harkov could not hide his shock and his mind raced as he gave out an exasperated breath harkov thought back to why he joined the order how he wanted to fight for peace and for those who couldnt fight for themselves maybe this was the path arnath had laid out for him james began to speak but was cut off by the young neophyte i accept i will become a war eagle the room was quiet but for only a moment james gave a sigh that sounded as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders he stood moving towards the bed harkov looked down at his hands nervous and unsure of what he had done harkov heard james stop in front of him and looked up and saw in jamess hands a plain greatsword take this my boy we must begin your training with haste we only have a week before you deploy to davens reach thank you master harkov took his new blade it was a comfortable weight the blade felt strong but agile james made his way towards the door before turning to harkov and saying let us beginbrynja sighed heavily as she leaned against the door forcing it shut her eyes stayed closed as she pictured the room before her in her mind it had been months since she had been home since she set off with the human expedition into the dirge swamp slowly she forced her eyes open taking in the small building that was so familiar yet longforgotten everything was as it had been before she left save for the layer of dust that had accumulated stepping in silence through the building she traced her fingertips along her table her walls anything that she could reach words would never be enough to describe the relief she felt at finally coming home nor the shame she felt for taking each of these items for granted as such they remained unsaid inhaling deeply taking in the familiar aroma the dust tickled in brynjas nose but she didnt care she quickly made her way over to the fireplace and soon had a small blaze started pots of water were placed above the heat combined with others in a tub to create a hot bath it must have been months since she got to bathe like this to finally feel clean as she began to disrobe brynja noticed the aching stiffness in her joints despite her young age must be the weather she mused knowing well that the cold air was not the cause of her pain her body had been subjected to trial after trial more than she had thought she could endure in just the last few months a sharp pain in her ribs stopped her suddenly as she pulled her tunic off her chest had been uncomfortable ever since the horrible day in hazemane village she was one of many corrupted who was corralled by an axhound warpack and left to die by a cleansing fire her heart ached and her eyes began to sting as she remembered the man for whom she had nearly given her life the cleric who panicked and fled only to be cut down why did the great wolf not call her name instead he was not ready to die as she had been this was the man who had sacrificed so much to give hope to so many in the hopes of easing her suffering he had taken a wound from brynja unknowingly submitting himself to the corruption as well it was for this reason that brynja could not shake the feeling of guilt welling up in her stomach and it nearly made her sick her tongue was drawn to her fangs newly budding for the first time in nearly a year that had not been the first time her teeth had been removed and would likely not be the last it was cruel however as she was infected with the corruption shortly after being mutilated as she was the foul magic kept her from healing properly and as such her fangs refused to grow back she would never be whole again after that hellish night nor the nine months of nightmares that followed now for the first time since she finally began to feel as though her world might not collapse at a moments notice she finally began to feel once more like an ulven not a shell of her former self as she stood bare before the bath she could not will herself into the water quite yet glancing down her fingers traced a path across her chest and arms winding their way to every scar some more recent than others a bruise just below her tattoo forced a grimace onto her face a rough scaly patch of skin on her shoulder reminded her of the fire in hazemane village a mostly healed puncture in her left arm called to mind the battle of pyre hills the honorable whiteoak warrior that nearly ended her life before succumbing to his wounds from their duel eventually her fingers made their way to her left hand caressing the recently stitched wound in her palm manetho had done excellent work in repairing the wound but the damage had been severe it had to be to finally force the corruption from her body she slowly squeezed her hand into a fist exerting far more effort to do so than she liked to admit at the time she had feared that she had lost the use of her shield hand though determination manetho called it bullheadedness allowed her to begin to build the muscles again it would be months before she was once again in fighting shape but she was beginning to see progress and thats all that truly mattered finally brynja stepped into the steaming water embracing the heat as it relaxed her weary muscles as she lowered herself into the bath her left arm nearly gave out demanding attention and pushing the memory of the illfated swamp expedition back into her mind she had forgotten so much of that journey save the image of her comrades fleeing the mordok as she fell to the mud the wretched beasts swarming all around her her head sank below the surface of the water hoping that the sensation would wash away the memory as she did she felt her hair pull against her trying to float back to the surface and she recalled the moment she had cut it off near the edge of the swamp with the mordok tormenting her when a group of shattered spear hunters descended upon the creatures seeing her chance for freedom brynja had grabbed the knife in her belt and sliced off the lock of hair being held by one of the mordok and crawled to the hunters it was in newhope that one of marquess madelines aides trimmed what was left of her hair into a somewhat presentable style shorter than she was used to to be sure though it stayed out of the way far better than it had before might as well keep it she chuckled to no one as she surfaced she breathed heavily and allowed herself to drift away in the first true bit of rest in months a knock on the door jolted her awake she had no idea how long she had been asleep though her skin was pink and wrinkled and the water had started to cool the knock came again as brynja scanned the room for her cloak she left the tub and wrapped herself just as the visitor cracked the door it was a young warrior one whom she had trained many years before nefstein what is it brynja prodded trying not to show the sleep lingering in her eyes there was a letter for the pack everyone is talking about it he began it just showed up today from onsallasbut theres something else well spit it out whats wrong brynja had never been the patient kind this letteritsfor youreyna sat in the dim light of the hall of gaia it was quiet tonight in onsallas with just a handful of the daughters nearby they were practicing meditation with some of the daughters in training who had drawn tonight to be on duty in case fighting broke out it was a good way to spend time when one must be alert for the worst reyna herself was not on duty she simply couldnt sleep and found it better to sit here in the firelight her needle drawing thread through the fabric of the hangerok she was preparing for the upcoming dinner that was be the held in new hope perhaps she could convince them of what projects would bring them true greatness instead of the follies her cousin was making them think possible but thinking too far into the future was something she considered dangerous here on the edge of the dirge it was dangerous to think too far ahead every day was change and even the seasons could be unpredictable if the earth itself took it into her mind to be difficult the only thing reyna had ever found consistent was magic mana formed the warp and the weft of the world in an immaculate divine version of the muslin that was pooled on her lap the pieces of the dress had been formed into shape as gaia had brought the world into existence from the void that must have been before she made the world and much like her needle trailed thread behind it in patterns that were intended daughters of gaia and the other casters pulled magic together into spells that let the will of the caster be made true on the world needlework held the answers to many things including having a calm center meditation was much like the spinning the spinner drew fiber from the prepared roving as the daughter drew mana from the roving gaia had prepared for them the most complicated lessons came in the form of the most useful of seemingly mundane tasks to make clothing was to create to find a connection to gaia that a daughter should value for through her creation of beauty through needle and thread a daughter could bring herself closer to gaiabryech made his way into a larger mining village near the base of the great wolfs hackles it was a rather crowded community with people and miners moving in and out of homes and small shelters the main road was filled with small shops selling a wide assortment of goods from tools to trinkets bryech slowly waded through the crowds towards a smith of some renown who was said to live down in the smithy at the end of the main road next to the hall bryech finally made it to the home after several attempts at breaking through the crowd even though he was in full armor and armed to the teeth the villagers had seemingly no problem shoving him in their attempts to make it to their destination bryech had gone from a calm and aloof demeanor to his infamous scowl which finally seemed to grant him a second glance and a little more space as bryech ran through the materials he needed to request of the smith he was surprised by a man whom he hadnt seen in years appear from underneath the open walled pavilion the man gasped as he looked at the young ulven they both stood taken off guard for a long time neither of them said anything just stood there in the cacophony of moving people until the man broke the silence youve grown my boy his voice was a strange mix of caution and pride bryech snarled and with only that as his only warning punched his father in the face sending him backwards into the crowd of people who quickly moved away as bryech moved in to continue his assault before davrik could fully recover bryech pulled him up and began raining blows on him with his right hand and holding him by his tunic with his left you coward you abandoned us you abandoned your own son bryech roared as he punched his father again and again as he drew back his fist for a heavier strike he felt a dull thud on his back and turned to see a small blonde girl who couldnt have been more than a year younger than him hitting him with what looked to be a rolling pin bryech released his father who quickly stood and backed away to wipe the blood off of his face turning bryech slapped the girls hand sending the pin flying into the gathered crowd the girl made to slap him but bryech grabbed her wrist dont touch her screamed a reed thin blonde woman who looked like an older version of the girl as she stood in the door of the house attached to the smithy a young boy stood behind her with wide eyes bryech pulled the girl and in a fashion threw her at what bryech assumed was her mother bryech looked around at the assembled crowd of people some whispered amongst themselves some cheered other watched intently bryech began to stumble around looking at the gathered ulven he saw it in their eyes they thought he was dangerous like a rabid dog he felt fire and hate burn in his heart and snarled bryech im sorry davrik interrupted his son before he lost himself in his anger bryech stared back at his father in his usual scowl surveying the damage he had done a split lip and a small cut on his brow as well as an eye that was already swelling shut gaia be with you father for the great wolf judges harshly bryech replied turning his back and making his way to the road once again the crowd parted as he approached this pleased bryech while at the same time it filled him with anger bryech sat next to his small fire as the sun disappeared behind the horizon and moonlight began to blanket the countryside his mail lay wrapped in his cloak so that the morning dew wouldnt cause it to rust along with his sword and scramasax bryech spent his evening eating the last of his packed provisions combined with some fresher meat he had managed to trap the hare was healthy and had plenty of meat on it it was a pleasant change of flavor from dried meats and bread with no one to keep watch while he slept bryech was hesitant to sleep but regardless of his attempts at merely resting his tired feet he felt his eyelids grow heavy as the moon reached its peak bryech sleepily gazed at the moon and let his mind wander he thought of ingrid he missed her smile her laugh he missed her part of bryech told himself that he needed to forget her but he just couldnt cut her out of his heart his mind jumped to his father bryech instantly felt a growl unconsciously form in his chest he felt cheated deceived and it made him boil inside all of his former packmates were right his father was nothing bryech remembered him as bryech seethed as he pictured killing his own father instead of just bloodying him like he had he futilely shook his head in an attempt to clear his mind finally his mind drifted to war bryech heard the screams of dying men and jolted awake looking around bryech could only see mist he was in an area completely foreign from his camp he was confused but the sounds of a nearby battle peaked his interest and held his focus he rushed towards the cacophony of battle to only find more mist behind him bryech heard movement and turned quickly to find the source he was not searching long for a large hulking figure stood before him a strong cover of fog hid his face from view but his eyes glared with the light of the sun he was ulven who goes there bryech asked forcing his voice to be stable though he was wrought with confusion you know me brother replied the figure readjusting his stance as he did bryech didnt understand the stranger he had no memory of that voice he felt it was deep and gruff but he had no recollection of who carried the voice no games bryech barked losing his patience his voice sounded strong but there was doubt in it detectable by bryech and the figure the ulven chuckled and began to step forward as bryech tensed as the figure strode closer it began to become clearer through the mist he was in full armor chain with a plated brigandine and a specific helm harlok bryech asked dumbfounded he staggered backward a few steps before composing himself thats not possible you died i watched you die bryech yelled no longer attempting to act like he was in control of himself i have a warning for you friend harlok continued not offering any explanation youre not harlok harlok couldnt speak bryech argued my body couldnt but my spirit is another thing boy harlok barked with the hint of a challenge in his words bryech snapped out of his stupor of confusion is this the hunting grounds then was i killed in my sleep by some mordok mongrel bryech snapped back returning the challenging tone harlok laughed this didnt please bryech who began to snarl thats the warrior i knew now i have a warning for you harlok said his long fangs glinting in the strange light that permeated through the fog bryech nodded but did not say anything he was still so confused suddenly the mist around them filled with dark figures like harlok and one by one they stepped forward bryech recognized all of them though he didnt remember all of their names but he had seen their faces suddenly familiar faces started to appear orando timar nikolai finally two that stung him as they approached orrin krieger bryech asked his voice weaker than it used to be krieger nodded with a grunt and orrin smiled that ridiculous smile of his that bryech had seen so many times a darkness is coming brother they all said at the same time causing the phrase to echo with surprising volume tell me something i dont know bryech replied with a hint of sarcasm do not take this warning lightly snapped krieger his tone was far more aggressive than bryech remembered him by bryech was taken aback but he nodded to show his understanding what am i to do bryech asked the figures surrounding him looking at each individual waiting for an answer are you strong enough all of the assembled voices asked with their crushing volume it physically staggered bryech there was something deeper in that collection of voices it set itself apart from the rest bryech looked up from where he knelt to see a massive shadow moving from within the crowd it was not ulven it was something else bryech gasped as his star of gaia began to burn him underneath his tunic when he looked back toward the figure it had already entered the small clearing in the fog it was a massive midnight black wolf standing more than a full head taller than the tallest ulven eyes the color of the sun bryech stay staggered on one hand and one knee in awe could this really be him had bryech been killed because of his carelessness and was now to be judged bryech felt his heart beating fast in his chest he was sure all of the figures surrounding him could hear it especially the great wolf bryech met the great wolfs eyes and stood trying to stand at his full size despite the questions stampeding through his mind the great wolf looked at him for what felt like an eternity bryech could feel the great wolf sizing him up bryech awaited the question he knew he would one day hear instead the beast threw back his head and howled just like in the song of creation it was deep and loud full of loneliness and rage bryechs breath caught in his throat and he felt tears well in his eyes the great wolfs cry reminded him of how he had felt for so long and how he felt after knowing what its like to not be alone bryech tried to control himself but he couldnt the memories and emotions were too strong and he began to sob as he once again fell to his knees he roared through his tears letting all of his pain and rage fill his howl the softer cries of wolves began to rise till the sound was deafening bryech wiped the tears from his eyes and looked around harlok was gone a wolf stood in his place the same was the case for all of the ulven that had once surrounded bryech looking back at the great wolf bryech was surprised to see his eyes had changed color they were now a deep red and they began to glow bryech screamed as he felt a splitting pain pierce through his skull and pulse in his eyes bryech yelled as he panicked and bolted upright he scrambled and stood upright scanning frantically around his meager camp his fire had died down to mere embers and he could see the dawn breaking bryech sighed an exasperated sigh as he dropped down and sat against a tree closing his eyes bryech scolded himself for not being more careful despite that bryech began to laugh at himself a small chuckle which grew into a laughing cough bryech shook his head and rubbed his eyes wincing slightly as he did keep laughing like that and someone will think youve lost your mind said a voice very close by bryech jumped back into a better stance and found himself facing a cloaked figure sitting across the embers from him bryech saw the large dane axe sticking out of the ground in front of the stranger and he looked towards his bundled up cloak where the handle of his sword was sticking out no need to worry im not here to kill you the stranger commented nonchalantly bryech was once again confused this stranger had an air of familiarity and bryech couldnt figure out why ive already had enough roundabout conversations these last few hours so spare me bryech barked sizing up the man he had red eyes that had a slight glow to them when the sun hit them he smiled a wolfish grin hitting bryech with another wave a familiarity his fangs caught the sun as did his eyes revealing at least something about him who are you bryech demanded more so than he asked the stranger made a strange motion with his hands before responding a memory a fate a doomed idea i am many things bryech snarled at his response he was growing tired of hearing riddles and cryptic omens answer me he barked at the stranger the ulven grew quiet but made no attempt to challenge slowly the stranger reached for the hem of his hood and pulled it back revealing a mass of shaggy hair and a long scar running down the left side of his face bryech growled he looked just like him before bryech could speak the stranger cut him off i am bryech savagefang warrior leader of war parties scourge of the mordok bryechs identical stood and began circling the bed of embers bryech mirrored him sizing him up again they were similar in stature the stranger seemed to be older than bryech something which puzzled him his garb was different too leathers and mail included he even had a perfect copy of the star of gaia he hung from his neck except for one striking difference the stranger had his necklace adorned with what looked like fangs tell me then why do you bear trophies from the dead bryech asked apprehensively the stranger chuckled and held the necklace in his hand admiring it for a moment before looking back to bryech because i know what i am and where i come from but unlike you i embrace it the stranger was trying to aggravate him with that the stranger knew about his past it seemed the stranger cut bryech off again tusks cut from mordok slain by my hand the two had finally come full circle and now stood next to their weapons the stranger grabbed the haft of his axe and with one swift motion pulled it from the ground holding it in his right hand he pointed at bryech who had already drawn his sword and held his shield down at his side i am everything you could have been i am glory i am legend the stranger roared the same roar bryech knew to be his own so much for not being here to kill me huh bryech asked calmly he felt his heart beat faster as he anticipated the coming fight he knew this calm though it was that of a warrior who had seen battle and sought more the calm of a warfighter the stranger gave no response save a battle cry as he charged over the embers bryech raised his shield and braced his feet as he saw the dane axe come down with a strong overhead strike though his strike was strong the stranger couldnt break bryechs guard bryech stepped in and thrust his sword towards his opponents torso bryech watched as the tip of his sword met the strangers mail which exploded into countless shards of metal and punched through his torso just below the sternum bryech did not flinch when he heard the deep wet crunch that came with the strike he had heard it far too many times for it to affect him he enjoyed it even as the stranger made that gargling noise as he began to choke on his own blood the dane axe fell off to the side and also shattered into pieces as bryech lowered his shield and looked his opponent in the eye while still holding his sword with a swiftness surprising for a dying man the stranger placed both of his hands on the sides of bryechs face and locked eyes with him never forget who you are the stranger said no longer choking on his own blood bryech tried to escape his grasp but the man held tight for all you could have been is all you still can be the stranger said as he began to fall apart almost like he was turning into ash bryech growled as the ash began to swirl around him the pieces still burning with the small flickering orange glow on the edges bryech looked at the ulven as he faded away never let your fire die lest your heartsong end as well the man said before he finally turned wholly into ash bryech looked around him as the ashes began to move faster bryech felt a strong sensation fill his body he felt a fire burn inside him with an intensity he hadnt felt in some time bryech roared into the rising dawn and was overtaken by darkness bryechs eyes opened as a branch snapped in the distance bryech looked around his camp and it was exactly as he remembered it sitting up bryech saw no sign of the stranger and with slow and steady movements looked around confused bryech tensed as he heard more noise approaching his camp it wasnt loud it was meticulous almost patient bryech had no time to ponder his dreams he was being hunted bryech quietly hopped to his gear and drew his sword and scramasax quickly as he could without making too much noise bryech made his way to a fallen tree a few yards away and hid behind it seconds after he had mantled the fallen oak two mordok made their way into view they crouched down sniffing the air on the other side of a creek bryech guessed they were a hunting pair out searching for prey before coming upon his scent bryech watched as they crossed the creek with a surprising quietness bryech once again scolded himself for being so careless as to fall asleep while he was alone the mordok found his camp easily his scent and poor attempt at finding a concealed position made it almost look like childs play bryech crouched as he sized them up while at the same time pondering what they were doing so far south in ulven territory the closest one was a real brute with a vicious looking axe in one hand and a rusty unkempt dagger in the other while his partner was a smaller mordok armed with a bow the mordok investigated the campsite bryech was sure they wouldve ransacked it if they thought the camp had more inhabitants bryech tensed as the brute suddenly turned towards him and sniffed excitedly bryech ducked down behind his tree and readjusted his grip on his sax dropping his sword he waited in anticipation as he heard the mordok begin running over to the tree he heard a grunt as the beast jumped onto the log bryech looked up and saw it look out and over him without hesitation bryech drove his dagger into the mordoks stomach and grabbed him with his free hand dragging him over the tree the beast was caught off guard and fell off of bryechs sax and onto the ground with a dull thud before the mordok could react he leapt on top of it pulling his scramasax out with a fluid motion before flipping it in his hand and driving it through the brutes temple once and then twice bryech pulled back for a third strike before he felt a piercing pain shoot through his left hand causing him to drop his sax rolling off his quarry bryech took cover as an arrow sank into the tree with a loud thunk bryech growled as he looked at the arrow sticking through the center of his palm he looked over the log as the remaining mordok took aim again bryech sunk behind the log and grabbed his sword with his right hand after some reaching you just made this more fun for me bitch bryech roared as he jumped up and over the tree he began to rush towards the mordok as it loosed another arrow the arrow flew just past bryechs face as he showed no sign of slowing down the mordok nocked another arrow as bryech closed the distance but was a moment too slow bryech bellowed as he cut the bow clean in two and on his return drove his sword hilt deep into the archers chest and out through its back relishing in the sounds of the kill bryech growled after the beast dropped to the ground sword still buried deep in its chest bryech spat tell your friends about that you fuck wincing bryech slowly pulled the arrow out of his hand he looked at the hole in his hand and grunted he hadnt been wounded in quite some time it was almost a foreign concept to him strangely the throbbing pain in his hand seemed to be mirrored in his head as he felt pain in the front of his skull and down into his nose and eyes after treating his wound and donning his armor bryech looked at his star of gaia the lone star glinting in the sunlight bryech contemplated his dream and what his ghost had told him bryech glanced at the corpses of the mordok piled next to each other and drew his sax bryech spoke to himself aloud as he walked towards the

through the trials testimonies and judgements of each involved personby cole potter as the sun rose brother ventaris strode through the halls of the inner keep passing room after room of the lions quarters some were open with lions preparing for the day others filled with loud and boisterous snores of sleeping men and women those who were awake greeted him as he passed and he greeted them in kind his demeanor was one that appeared stern but held a serenity and sense of control brought on by a cool temper ventaris reached the end of the hall and made his way down the stairs to the lower level of the hall there were less rooms here as it was difficult and costly to dig out the space needed for underground rooms ventaris turned left at the bottom of the stairs and walked parallel to the stairs as he approached his destination the door to the room sat slightly ajar ventaris calmly pushed open the door and took in the small room before him sleeping in the bed was a young man sprawled out and snoring lightly the room was half cleaned with clothes and equipment piled hastily against the far wall brother ventaris sighed and shook his head at the idea of having to take this boy on as an apprentice regardless of how agreeable the young man was ventaris looked towards the small wash basin that sat in the corner full of water and smirked harkov walked through a maze of stone pillars each one varying in size harkov remembered this place it was a monument in new hope one dedicated to the lives lost on faedrun harkov wandered for a time and found that no matter how far he walked in any direction he never found his way out of the maze his vision was hazy and he seemed to have tunnel vision he stumbled through the maze when a laugh caught his attention he looked to his right and saw a blur move past the path to his right he knew the laugh and chased after the blur then hed hear the laugh in another direction and change directions accordingly harkov grew ever closer to the blur until finally it wasnt a blur harkov saw her outline and just admired her she turned and smiled he went to say something but he was wrenched from his dream by a stinging cold that caused him to suck in a sharp breath and fall out of his bed gasping and stuttering harkov landed on the floor with an audible crash and stumbled quickly to his feet to survey his disturbance at the foot of his bed stood brother ventaris chuckling and holding harkovs now empty wash basin what in the hell harkov asked his mind still not quite centered after his rude awakening ventaris walked past him and returned the wash basin to its holder before turning and walking towards the door if youre to be my apprentice you will be training as a lion get changed and meet me outside ventaris ordered calmly without so much as a look before departing harkov sighed and made his way over to his bed before sitting on the edge and running his fingers through his still dripping hair  ive had worse awakenings harkov said to himself as he threw on some dry clothes harkov made his way hurriedly outside as he ducked past initiates and lions his rush caused some shouting behind him but harkov didnt bother to stop he was on a mission harkov exited his barracks and quickly spotted brother ventaris standing beside a group of lay militiamen with a large sack at his feet harkov eagerly greeted his teacher and stood waiting for his instruction with an almost overzealous military resting stance ventaris picked up the sack and tossed it at harkovs feet the sack landed with a loud thud and the sound of metal gently sliding against metal harkov knelt down and opened the sack and found a set of freshly oiled chainmail a gambeson as well as leather bracers and greaves upon further inspection though the mail was rusting in some parts and the leathers were worn the gambeson was well worn in and had many spots beginning to tear harkov didnt dare complain fearing reprimand and physical training as punishment  it is to my understanding that until this point youve only been borrowing armor for training since you had little money when you arrived and that went towards your mace so i pulled some strings and managed to get you this ventaris explained as harkov began to don the armor it is yours to keep and maintain you will earn your plate as all lions do when you have proven yourself ready understood ventaris continued harkov nodded with a grunt as he slid the bracers over his forearm so what training will we be doing today harkov asked as two lay squires jogged forward and handed harkov and ventaris each a worn training shield and their mace and hammer ventaris rolled his shoulders his own chain chattering as he readjusted obstacle course ventaris stated almost immediately after a sharp whistle blew and the militiamen started running brother ventaris jogged behind them and harkov fell in line beside him the first obstacle was mud pits harkov slogged through the water filled pits whilst the mud pulled at his boots and greaves with a deep slurping sound and cleared the mounds of dirt piled between each pit assisting anybody he could on the way up harkov loved the challenge and made no attempt to hide it as he plodded beside brother ventaris none of the other men and women wore armor or held weapons so their pace was much faster than harkov and ventaris the obstacles were each challenging in their own right an eight foot high wall that required a degree of teamwork even for those without armor weighted sacks that you had to carry for a distance were cumbersome let alone having to bear shield and mace a rope wall walls one needed to mantle and roll under an underwater passage and another pool of knee deep mud and water tested even the strongest men and women after all of that the group was split into teams of three for a test of strength and will a tug of war was held ventaris and harkov paired with a militia women and battled their way into the championship bout harkov took the front of the rope as he always had and was breathing heavily as sweat and water dripped down his entire body ventaris anchored the rope and the militia women took the middle their opponents were three large and strong men with the one in front being of exceptional form and their anchor a massive man with a combination of muscle and sheer mass the two teams battled for what seemed like an eternity each round until it was sudden death the order was given and the two teams struggled harkov gave a shout and pulled with all his might as ventaris and the militia women both pulled with their all as well their opponents were strong though and began to pull them towards the mud pit slowly inch by inch harkov was pulled to the edge of the pit when suddenly they stopped and harkov and ventaris bellowed as they began to pull and gained a modicum of ground back their attempts were in vain though as their opponents gave one final heave and harkov heard a ripping as his hauberk sleeve caught in the thick corded rope and he flew into the mud pit sputtering and wiping mud from his face harkov looked up to see the outstretched hands of his comrades who pulled him from the pit the entire group rejoiced at the end of the exercise and all scattered to the wind as harkov ventured over to a water barrel to begin washing himself ventaris clasped his shoulder and haggardly said nice job out there you did good harkov felt pride well in his chest and began to peel his soaking armor off of himself his leathers were saturated and saggy flattening out with little resistance his gambeson and tunic heavy with water and the mud made a sucking noise as he peeled them off himself as harkov stood over the water barrel he heard a strange scratching noise above him and looked up just in time to take a copious amount of ice cold water to the face staggering a step and quickly shaking out his hair harkov looked back up to see a pretty red haired woman who appeared to be around harkovs age looking over the edge of a balcony with an empty bucket in her hands harkov could hear brother ventaris laughing as he washed himself at an adjacent barrel you looked like you could use a bath the woman said giggling that i did harkov nodded with his own chuckle harkov shot ventaris a look and when he looked back the girl was gone one of the militiamen caught harkovs attention and made a crude gesture insinuating some less than gentlemanly things with a ridiculous face which put harkov in stitches and the small group that had gathered at the barrels also shared a hearty laugh as muddy water flowed off of them in sheets and heavy droplets harkov admired the moment it was one of the first in a long time where he had been so carefree later in the mess hall harkov sat alone and picked at his food his mind wandering far from reality harkov was so deep in thought he didnt even notice brother oliver and brother ventaris sit down across from him till oliver cleared his throat harkov pulled himself from his own little world and shook his head forgive me i was lost in thought harkov apologized no need to apologize i just wanted to check in with you quick brother oliver replied kindly brother ventaris tells me you show great potential i implore you to keep up the good work oliver said in his calm yet cheerful tone before excusing himself to attend to his other duties harkov started eating his meal in earnest with his newly found company ventaris and harkov ate in relative silence giving in to the din of conversation harkov eventually could not bare to be silent any longer and spoke can i ask you something brother ventaris harkov asked that depends on your question ventaris replied before taking a heavy drink from his tankard why did you run the course with me harkov leaned forward placing both elbows on the table he continued with a slight stutter iit just doesnt make sense to me almost every military trainee like myself are instructed by trainers but the trainers rarely participate in the actual training so why did you harkov leaned back in his seat with his brow furrowed in confusion awaiting for ventaris to respond ventaris made to respond but held up a finger when he realized he was chewing on too much food to speak through when he finished ventaris gave the young man his explanation lions are warriors yes and we are the iron fist of our order so we style ourselves like a military but we are far different from the armies of nobles or kingdoms ventaris took another drink from his tankard before continuing the clamor of the hall was begging to tone down as the night continued to grow closer and closer the title brother means something far more to us than it does to those in a military we are all agents of arnath and we serve faithfully on his path the path we tread is a long and at times a lonely one darkness can consume someone if they walk alone for too long harkov nodded his understanding at least what he thought he understood i ran the course with you because you have taken the first steps to becoming one of us it is my duty as a lion and as one of your future brothers to make sure you know what that title means you want an instructor talk to basil harkov nodded it all made sense to him but he also still didnt fathom why the order would spend this much time and energy for him they trained him fed him clothed him all because he might become a lion no single person put that much stock in him before let alone an entire order it wasnt like he was special but they treated him like he truly had the potential of those who came before us brother ventaris interrupted harkovs thoughts abruptly stop thinking so much and eat your food you want to stop looking like a scrawny little runt so you need to eat the two laughed and ventaris excused himself harkov set to his food still not quite focused on eating later that evening harkov lay on his bed and gazed out of the small window in the opposite corner of his room the full moon cast a strong light out into the settlement and gave harkov a good view of the night sky harkov had tried for hours to fall asleep but he couldnt his mind scattered around jumping from thought to thought most of them he had hoped to forget harkov sighed and sat up looking around his room his insomnia causing a new found frustration and at that moment harkov was glad he was the only inhabitant on this level as he roared his frustrations into the night laying back on his bed harkov closed his eyes and did something he hadnt done in a long time he prayed arnath i know i have never been a man to pray often but i need guidance harkov took a deep breath before continuing show me a sign show me something so that i know that im not just wasting their time harkov waited awhile before opening his eyes nothing had changed no ethereal presence had come with wisdom no visions of arnath entered his mind harkov felt dread strike ice through his heart and felt his throat well with fear as he sat in the dark a feeling of hopelessness crept over him harkov stared at the ceiling and began to weep something else he hadnt done in a long time he sobbed until the light in his room grew stronger harkov sat up once more to investigate rubbing his eyes and feeling a pleasant warmth spread across his cheeks looking at his hands harkov gasped as he saw silver light glinting and flowing like water around his hands gleaming like a tiny river of stars swirling back and forth harkov sat amazed and felt his ice cold dread be replaced with burning excitement harkov began to speak one of the battle prayers he had learned to see what would happen it is for us to stand when others cant the light grew stronger and flowed toward his forearm it is for us to hold when others run the light moved further encompassing both harkovs hands and almost half of his forearm it is for us to fight when all hope is lost such forges our faith such forges the future the silver glow now encompassed both his arms to the elbow and shined brightly in the din of harkovs room almost as quickly as it had come the light disappeared harkov looked at his hands as the glow faded harkovs head now swam with dazzling lights filling his vision he was tired now so very tired and then everything went black harkov awoke the next morning to the sound of birds chirping and people moving about outside harkov felt groggy his tongue was dry and his teeth felt as if they had hair he had slept the kind of sleep where one was too far gone to care for comfort or dreams he had been wiped out after the night before having drained him so heavily harkov was excited but his joy was tainted by how awful he felt the days and weeks blurred together harkov and ventaris trained day in and day out doing labor during the periods of time they werent training the settlement was still growing and required many strong hands to build it the heat of summer after one final stubborn stand gave way to the cool mornings of early autumn even with all of the distraction from his old life harkov still couldnt escape all of his demons they found him most when he was doing something that requires little thought like chopping wood or clearing brush the new farms that were being built required large amounts of work from all members of the order who were fit and able to wield tools harkov liked how hardy the people of starkhaven were none were exempt from the labors of progress it maintained the stereotype of hardy and strong humans from the north a respectable image at the least there was much to be done be it clearing brush or moving dirt to fill ruts in the road or shore up foundations the trees of mardrun had roots that ran deep and each tree that needed to be cleared was a daunting task that usually required shifts one such shift is where harkov met with his demons once more the crews were dealing with a stubborn stump that even trying to cut it down enough so that it could be buried was difficult harkov had been switching off with ventaris every so often whilst they chipped away at the root after hours of chopping they still werent done and the end didnt seem near harkov worked at the stump with weary arms and a mind that was unfocused to the task his thoughts went to his past and he saw memories and thoughts he wished he hadnt his anger and frustration filled him and suddenly his arms werent so heavy and the world around him faded to somewhere far away as he hacked viciously at the stump causing wood chips to fly everywhere showering himself and the earth around him his ears picked up noise but it sounded far away and as if someone was talking through water slowly it became clearer and clearer the voice was ventaris he was yelling now harkov didnt stop he was too focused on the images in his head until finally it came through clearly harkov harkov bellowed and gave one last vicious strike and with a resounding crack cut through the stump harkov leaned back and looked around ventaris had a look of surprise in his face but it held something else exactly what harkov couldnt tell harkov looked down at his hands they were starting to get raw and red harkov knelt like that till he felt a hand on his shoulder looking up harkov saw captain orn ree who with a degree of pride said this young man now knows the strength of fury it seems a few of the other men gave a cheer both in celebration of a griffon acknowledging the young initiate and that the stump was finally low enough to just dig over and be done with harkov smiled reflexively but played back what ventaris had told him the path we tread is a long and at times a lonely one darkness can consume someone if they walk alone for too long harkov knew he wasnt truly alone but then again he also knew things were never so simple with himscratch scratch scratch how many days had it been a woman carved a tally mark into a board for every sunrise she saw without sleeping the sun on the water hurt her eyes and her vision blurred she couldnt count the marks anymore but she could see her reflection and her face was dark like a bruise as if it were rotting ragna axehound wondered idly if that was what her brain looked like too that was how she felt rotting long ago ragna had felt the heat of the wolfs breath on the back of her neck she was a warrior who stared gloriously down the mordok hordes as her comrades died around her few would sing songs of that bravery though  though she had survived numerous battles her deeds of valor were not so many space spoke to ragna as she sat by the water in contemplation its time to go said the air behind her in her sisters voice ragna you know what will happen if you disobey them  these are the warchiefs orders its the only way ragna grimaced a week ago she had defied the mordok and they dragged her into a pool of ink and fed black mice into her throat she could still feel them squirming in there in her belly now because of her failure the axehound would punish her by means of exile quarantine they called it because the corruption was becoming an epidemic ragna knew what would happen either way when her cousin was struck with plague seven years ago the axehound warriors were ordered to put him down her sister was too young to remember the tragedy ragna would remember forever her sisters hand finally materialized on her shoulder it felt like space and time were distorted and the hand had just reached through a hole in the atmosphere  like ragna only dreamed that her sister was there it took no more than a few hours to reach the other side of the lake where the rest of the corrupted were already interred she had friends here but after a week without sleeping she could barely recognize their faces she didnt notice her sister saying goodbye and she couldnt make out the sadness and fear twisted on her face ragna stared at the water for days her board was gone so she couldnt count the days anymore so instead she thought about her mother her hateful mother who still whispered to her in the back of her head and promised her lies about freedom she felt the cold crawling of her mothers tendrils on her back and saw her reflected in her eyes surrounded by rotting flesh she couldnt remember gaias arms anymore she couldnt taste any sweetness when she ate the fruit of gaias beard she couldnt even feel softness when she pet gaias hounds the corruption was her only mother now perhaps she thought it had always been this way and this darkness was gaias true face ragna tried to push those thoughts from her mind she was a devout ulven and in a brief moment of clarity the idea revolted her but the creature in her blood reminded her yes in a cold whisper i am your mother i love you and i will feed you ragna puked into the lake and refused the call she couldnt get the mice out of her belly and she couldnt get the voice out of her blood it felt like her emotions were being ripped into pieces she was sick and lost and all she wanted was to feel normal again warriors were at the gates axehounds her kin when she was young the sight of their blades and bright eyes made her feel so safe and not so long ago she was one of them and drank and laughed with them and hunted beasts and fought mordok beside them that was her life once until now their eyes were filled with sadness and it frightened her they didnt have the corruption in their bodies but she could feel a heavy darkness in their hearts as easily as she could now sense the mordok lurking in the water whom no one else believed were there i am your mother the corruption comforted her i will protect you and my milk will make you whole ragna tried to cough out her rotting blood days passed again and ragna was starved and soaked in urine barely able to move in her sleeplessness ragna saw and felt things that no earthly language could describe she knew she was delirious but she embraced it now because there was nothing else to pass the time she repeated the corruptions words in her mind to her former friends she was a cocoon and her mother was almost ready to hatch and bloom like wildflowers she was ready for ragna to die so her blood could be smeared on everybody so the corruption could spread so everyone could rot and burst like fruit left in the sun and then they arrived the corruption seemed to retreat inside her body from these holy people  a young priestess of gaia whos warmth made ragna cry and a human holyman in red who made ragna feel like she was burning that was what she wanted she thought to be burned alive a token figurine a deers head hung on a nail on the wall of the shack by the time ragna noticed it that day it had come loose so it hung upsidedown its antlers pointing downward the creature in her body quivered fearfully sucking its tentacles back into her brain like a snail to its shell and ragna laughed and sobbed and dragged her dirty nails through the wood knowing that this was an omen today burning in the sun ragna and her cruel mother would be separated the tale of the axehound massacre would go down as one of the grimmest stories in ulven history not a battle to be celebrated there are no victories to be sung when ulven turn their swords on oneanother but on that day there was also ragna who even in her delirium held her honor and loyalty to her clan and to the people of mardrun by bravely giving her life so that others might find a way to fight the mordoks corruption her flesh would serve as the final piece in the puzzle of creating a new ritual that would burn the creeping corruption from a persons body for good her final memories would be of her clansmen holding her and whispering your name will ring in the ears of the great wolfbryech savagefang the moon shone brightly over the ironmound countryside the warm early summer breeze carried with it the howls of wolves their calls were deeper than the normal casting a melancholy feel to any creature that could hear it bryech sat against a tree a few yards from a small house situated on the top of a hill he watched the moon listening to the sounds of the night bryech hummed to himself a tune as he examined his amulet of gaia the intricate weave of metal rings always felt pleasantly warm when he held it he never understood it but it was comforting ive never heard that tune before whats it from asked a gray ulven he had a long scar that ran through a milky eye on the left side of his face bryech looked up from where he sat and chuckled at the old man its an old song my mother used to sing to me about the great wolf bryech replied the old ulven exhaled exasperatedly as he sat next to bryech and sat with him in silence for a while the warm summer night was full of the sounds of cicadas and creatures of the night a warm breeze greeted the pair now and then as they sat and watched the moon i should thank you for your hospitality these last months bjarke bryech said breaking the calm quiet of the night it is i who should be thanking you bjarke replied turning to look at bryech with a warm smile you saved calder during the battle and have been a true friend to my family and our people ever since you arrived in our territory bryech grunted still not much for conversation come inside although we sup late you know it is always worth it bjarke commented as he stood with slow deliberate action giving light to his age bryech stood and assisted him both of them chuckling as they walked back towards the house the small house was far more comfortable than its outside appearance would suggest with a warm hearth and many rooms bryech sat at a large rectangular table with bjarke and his family calder his son a brave ulven at a year younger than bryech he shared in similar stature to him if only slightly less mass gunhild bjarkes mate and a fierce woman old and gray like her husband with a kind motherly demeanor and ingrid their daughter was the oldest of the younglings having been born months before bryech was bright and kind like her mother but a force to be reckoned with like her father and brother the group laughed as they ate a hearty supper of cooked venison that bryech and calder killed two days before the house was comfortably warm and the mood was light and happy between the inhabitants after dinner they all did their part in clearing the table and storing away the leftover food sharing a few more laughs before they all made their way to their furs for the night as the hours crept on bryech lay in the small curtained off area he had called his own for the past seven months and stared at the ceiling after he was certain the rest of the people in the house were running with their dreams bryech quietly slipped out into the night he made his way back to the tree this time examining it before sitting down the tree was old standing taller than any other tree in sight and seemed to radiate its own life to the area surrounding it bryech placed his hand on the tree and was overtaken by a sense of strength but deep inside he could feel his own rage and angst they say this tree grew on the first carcass that the great wolfs killed one of the first that gaia found any way came ingrids voice from behind him bryech turned and smiled they also said that it was gaia who tamed him bryech replied his words carried with them a sadness that he felt was his own yet at the same time not it was confusing and he couldnt wrap his head around it you think too much ingrid giggled her response and sat looking at the moon bryech chuckled and sat next to her maybe i do but it does make sense bryech stated as a matter of fact what does that mean ingrid asked two halves make one whole each piece fitting exactly with the other bryech began explaining that doesnt ingrid started hush woman let me finish bryech blurted out the two laughed heartily at that and had trouble regaining their composure when they did though bryech continued his explanation if each piece is to fit exactly with the other each one will have to allow the other to keep itself from growing too careless bryech looked out over the fields and went on gaia created the earth and made it her body she creates life and beauty and maintains it of her own accord this isnt always the case though sometimes the great wolf had to stop her from creating too much life less the world choke on its own abundance so the great wolf made his children the ulven but before the ulven there were the wolves and before them skol and hati their first children ingrid finished bryech turned to her and smiled they had grown close in his time with her family and he certainly felt something for her but he left his feelings for her hidden away with most everything else he felt the great wolf tasked his children with being the heralds of their mothers creations wardens if you will bryech finished before asking with a chuckle after a slight pause does that make any sense a little ingrid replied with a laugh of her own the two talked for a while longer about anything that crossed their minds bryech was happier in this moment than most in his last few years after all the death and destruction of the war it was nice to feel something else besides the anger but bryech knew that he couldnt avoid fate and changed the tone to match his true thoughts im leaving ingrid bryech said looking at her her smile faded and she avoided his gaze and just looked up at the moon the moonlight shone bright on her face giving her dark brown hair an almost midnight black appearance and bryech smiled again how foolish the whole scene must have looked ingrid broke the small silence just promise me youll be careful her voice was sad and bryech felt it pull on his heart but he knew he had to go i promise bryech replied calmly and almost inaudibly ingrid leaned over and kissed him on the cheek bryech smiled his fangs gleaming in the moonlight they both went inside and slept through the rest of the night bryech dreamt of wolves and their howls echoing through a great darkness the next morning bryech had his things packed and ready he wore all his armor for it was easier than carrying it with his other things as he went to leave he said his goodbyes to each of the people to whom hed grown so close bjarke stopped him longer than any of the others as he had to grab something from his and gunhilds room bjarke returned with a finely crafted sword my old sword it would serve you better than that secondhand short sword they gave you to fight the invaders bryech smiled and bowed his head to his friend it was a fine ulven longsword crafted from the finest ironmound steel the handle inlaid with etched bronze on the guard and pommel the handle was stamped and wrapped with strong black leather a gift fit for ones own blood given to a squatter bryech stated and glanced to calder who replied with his own brand of sarcasm i prefer to bludgeon those with my mace than finesse with a sword and you are no squatter you are a true friend as good as blood bryech nodded and took the sword and exchanged it with his old short sword a fine blade which will see many dead foes in its time bryech boasted with his wolfish smile he hugged his friends all one last time and left with a heavy heart and yet a freedom that he had almost forgotten and so the wolf returns to his duty herald of the light warden of the dark bryech said as he prayed to is necklace and felt its protection envelope him bryech walked for a few hours before he was close the edge of the valley the lush forests seemingly strangely quiet for this time of year as he left the valley bryech turned back and saw a black wolf watching from the edge of the tree line they watched each other for a while before the wolf howled a deep piercing call and faded into the woods peculiar for them to be active during the day but bryech took it as a sign bryech went forth with a renewed vigor back towards his old friends back to the fight read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1353storycoleixzz4djkgrwxri knew i should have stayed at the spire that was faolans first thought as he came to as his breathing starts to quicken and his heart races i need to stay calm and stay in control of myself he purposely focuses on his breathing in an effort to bring his heart rate back down when he opens his eyes the darkness that surrounds him makes it impossible for him to tell if his eyes are actually open as the rest of his senses start to return he can feel some sort of hood over his head well the good news is im probably not blinded then he realizes that his hands and feet are bound with his hands behind his back he tries to get enough movement in his wrists to channel a bit of mana but the ropes are too well tied damn it there goes the easy way he uses his shoulder to push himself up off the cold ground and finds what feels like a wooden wall to rest his back against the air filtering through the hood smells musty like the wall he is leaning against is suffering from some kind of rot so i probably wasnt attacked my mordok i think id be dead or worse by now who the hell then ok lets retrace our actions up to this point and try to figure this out i started out from the spire with the magi tyrannus on a mission to recruit more citizens for the settlement i wasnt keeping track of the days but judging by the last phase of luna i remember seeing it must be close to a month that weve been on the road we had just stayed the night before i hope i havent been out for more than a day in a village and the rest of the expedition had headed out early in the morning with some new recruits while i stayed behind to talk with a few more prospects the villagers seemed quite intrigued by the ideals of the archons and i was privileged to guide of few of them through their first meditation yet they were still hesitant when it came to learning how to manipulate mana i did my best to explain that they didnt need to become mages or any sort of mana users to be welcome at the spire we welcome any and all to wish to improve their expertise in any skill damn it which clans territory was that village in i need to get better at picking out the finer details that show which clan an ulven belongs to well we obviously didnt head towards grimward but i dont think we were still in nightriver were we in watchwolves or goldenfield why is squallborn sticking out there was a posting in that village from the prince of new aldoria about joining stormjarl in what sounded like was going to be an attack on squallborn sound military tactics that is announcing your plans to all the world giving plenty of time for your enemy to prepare he is going to restart the damn war i believe i can understand stormjarls frustration with outcome of the truce but there has to be some way to improve their lot without spilling more blood and risking more war back to figuring out my current predicament i had left the village just before sol reached his highest point in the sky my efforts with the prospects seeming to bear only buds and no fruit and made my way down the road to rendezvous with the magi tyrannus when i felt a sharp pain in the back of my head and gaia seemed to rush forward to meet my face who was it that knocked me out and kidnapped me how many of them are there what do they want with me faolans thoughts are interrupted by the creak of a rusty and primitive door hinge followed by the sound of steps shuffling through the dirt and a number of logs falling to the ground ah youre awake finally the voice of whoever was there was gruff like someone who has spent too much time out in cold during the winter who are you what do you want faolan asked of the voice who i am doesnt matter what i want doesnt really matter either since you seem to not carry any i dont carry any what were you trying to rob me well what the hell is your plan now where have you taken me some place where they will never find you or your body if it comes to that explains the voice while it sounds like logs are being stacked and arranged on the ground some feet away as the ominousness of those words sink into faolan his anxiety begins to creep back into his mind they you mean the magi tyrannus they are more capable than they might appear if i were you i would pray to whatever gods you believe in that vazra and the archons dont find youif it comes to that with faolan laying as much emphasis on the you as possible in an attempt to sow some uncertainty in his captor is that your name for the group you were traveling with strange but im not too worried about them i was able to slip into their camp and deliver my message to their leader without being noticed i doubt this varza or these archons would have much luck finding me the voice carried confidence almost to the point of hubris but also a slight hint of desperation then the sound of a knife being struck against stone punctuated the voices assertion that was followed by a few quick huffs of breath and weak wave of warmth though faolan could see no light through the hood covering his face so this person has been following us or stalking me for at least day before he attacked me if this is a bandit where are the rest of them he seems to be working on his own faolans thought was interrupted again but this time the sound came from the other side of the wall he was leaning against it sounded like someone had tripped in the dirt and fallen to the ground oh theres the rest of them just outside faolan thought but then he noticed that there was no sound coming from where the voice had been not even the the sound of breathing does he not know whos out there what the hell is going on then faolan heard the rusty hinges creak again followed by a shout from the voice who the hell is out here from the other side of the wall faolan heard whoever had fallen get up and break into a sprint then the voice seemed to break into a sprint after them so another bandit looking to score off this ones work it couldnt be the magi tyrannus they wouldnt send a scout out alone that would run from a fight so easily no honor among thieves typical off in the distance on the other side of the wall faolan could hear the voice again what are you doing out here that didnt take long take long and they seem to know each other i was scared and youve been gone for so long this other voice responded this second voice was a bit higher pitched and sounded younger than the first voice that had been talking with faolan i told you to stay in the village and ive not been gone for a day yet i know but i dont want you to be gone like mom mom thats a child out there thats his child out there so hes not a bandit what is he doing with me then look im almost done out here then ill be back to the village and well be moving on ok what are you going to do with him the second voice was almost inaudible when asking this question you dont need to worry just get back to the village with that faolan could hear light steps jogging away shortly then the rusty hinges sounded again what happened to your wife faolan decided to make the assumption based on what he had overheard mordok the answer was short but filled with all the anger and despair that exists in the world im sorry was she out gathering faolan heard the voice shuffle back towards the crackling fire no i was out hunting the mordok organized and attacked our village like ive never seen before she died getting our son safely hidden you didnt stay to rebuild your village there werent enough of us left to rebuild there werent enough of us left to defend against another attack like that the voice sounded defeated and broken it then sounded like he slumped back against the wall opposite faolan i see where are you moving on too yes so that you and yours can come find me and mine after all this no if youre looking for a safe home i can offer you and your son a place where you wont need to kidnap and ransom for coin youre talking about your spire i dont think my son and i would necessarily be welcomed gaia only shares the gift of mana with her daughters you dont need to be a mage or even gifted with mana to be welcome at the spire faolan insists you just need to want to improve yourself and better those around you it seems that the former is already true and i believe that the latter will prove true as well you think you know me that i want to owe my allegiance to anyone the voice sounds with disgust that faolan can make any assumptions about his intentions no i dont know you but ive know people like you that have come to the spire i know their motivations included providing a better situation for their children and maintaining the honor of their name you think honor is important to me the voice responds with a nervous laugh maybe im pretty sure having a son proud of the actions his father has taken is at least important to most parents whether or not honor is a concern for their own sake faolan feels that he might actually be getting through to this person he just needs to continue convincing him that is better way to provide for his son if you remove this hood unbind me and release me i give you my word that you will be welcomed at the spire why should i trust that you wont just turn me in bringing me to your magi tyrannus and have your revenge on me youll have to trust that my desire to see the life of another living being improved is stronger than my desire to seek revenge on those that have slighted me following that there is a long silence faolan just sits there waiting for any response or noise of movement from the other side of the shack after what seemed like an eternity of moments faolan hears the person against to opposite wall slide back up to their feet and step towards him faolan then feels a blade move between his ankles cutting the bindings around his legs followed by rough hands reach behind him lifting him up alright come on lets get you up and back out to the road then we can pick up my son in the village and go find your magi tyrannus im trusting that you care more about your honor right now than i do mineexperiment logal mafajjar experiment series 1372 experiment no 001 target subject 1s

nightriver the allied camp in clan squallborn territory was bustling with activity a combined forces camp of adventurers mercenaries volunteers clan stormjarl warriors and new aldorian soldiers all made up the people coming and going with different tasks in the camp wagons moved goods to and from locations in the camp and the nearby location the combined conquest of the new aldoria and clan stormjarl had been a success the initial landings on the beach saw very little resistance a few of the settlements and villages put up a fight but were terribly outnumbered stormjarl warriors along with the elite viknar carved a path through these coastal locations and sent the squallborn villagers fleeing further north this momentum continued throughout the entire previous month as pockets of defenders were battered and defeated or sent reeling further and further north unfortunately without additional military units and more soldiers the momentum could not be maintained the squallborn defenders became more numerous more organized more wellarmed simple skirmishes to defeat some farmers and send them running away eventually evolved into full scale fights between dozens of armed and armored warriors attrition had begun to take its toll and without more soldiers to push the chieftains of stormjarl and the officers of new aldoria had given the orders to return to the main camp and be reassigned recently ships began to arrive with building and construction materials instead of weapons and supplies to wage war there was no doubt now to the rest of the world clan stormjarl and new aldoria intended not only to fight clan squallborn but to conquer and take their lands it is still unknown how the other clans will react to this but construction had already begun on new settlements the goal now was to hold key locations and settlements and control what was taken and not to push further the campaign was a success as a huge swath of land was now controlled by new aldoria and clan stormjarl  unfortunately other concerns had begun to rise or returned now that the push was over thrand stormjarl walked with a brisk pace back to his tent his leather armor creaking a bit as he went he had his helm and arming cap tucked under his left arm and held his long axe with the other his shoulder hurt and he tested it out rotating it and he could feel the sting of the healing wound and he left it alone a squallborn arrow had punched through his leather pauldron and stuck deep he took it out after the recent fight and tended to the wound properly but it was still raw and sore he pushed the door of the canvas tent aside and stepped in an oil lantern was lit and cast light in the tent detailing out equipment weapons and furs used for bedding sitting in the tent in her armor fritha stormjarl looked up and greeted him with a smile he couldnt help but smile back at his mate he noticed the letter in her hand he must have interrupted her reading another letter from reyna its nice you still keep in contact how is she and the pack  not good not good at all fritha looked at him the concern was written on her face  what is happening thrand put his long axe down against the edge of the tent  the corruption is still there stanrick and selena left for serai a little over a month ago to talk to others about the corruption and have not returned a hunter found a site with a lot of blood and one of the longfangs belt flags was there they fear the worst has happened to them and now it seems the mordok are attacking with coordination and longer than they ever have before this letter does not have any good news for our friends  so the rumors i overheard were true some of the warriors of the phoenix were talking about the mordok corruption i saw one of them the man named aimerick there was a terrible affliction in him and there was nothing i could do it is terrifying to think the mordok can corrupt others like that and there seems to be no cure although that matters a great deal the organized way of the mordok now is foreboding we lived on the edge of the swamp weve fought plenty of mordokbut to hear of them acting this way i dont like it said thrand as he took a seat on a stool in the tent we are here pledged to this contract for the clan and their new aldorian ally i wish we could do something to help but i think the longfangs will have to fight this one on their own for a while  that is the problem they have been supplies are running short the mordok are not leaving like the usually do everyone who could help are all here the mordok picked one hell of a time to attack she turned her back to thrand exposing the buckles to her pauldrons to him  what am i your thrall thrand smiles and gets up and steps closer to fritha he begins to unbuckle her pauldrons and then turns back to the more serious conversation at hand if the longfangs can hold out long enough perhaps some allies from this fight can go there and help you heard the commanding officer of our allied camp we are being reassigned to patrols or defensive duties of the territory we have taken i think the fighting is going to die down for now but i dont think the warleader or the prince intends to let clan squallborn take their lands back too easily we are stuck here for now if you want to then we can plan to travel to onsallas to help as soon as we are done here we may not be of pack longfang anymore but we still have friends there and they need help especially now that the chieftain has gone missing  so what are we to do go on patrols and sit around as our friends need help her voice was rising due to the emotions the bulk of the fighting is done squallborn has seen the size of the army we have brought i dont think they will be running back to us for a fight we did what the prince had asked of us we were the front of the line to help him in his conquest and to also help stormjarl frithas shoulders squared and her voice evened out look the longfangs are our allies and they need help stormjarl and longfangs have been allies for generations our people helped onsallas get started we have sent warriors there to be trained they have kept the northern border protected from mordok they have sent their best warriors to us in our time of need and they died in the battle of black wolf creek as friends and allies we have a duty to help protect them her eyes softened as she looked at her mate they need help thrand i cant stay here for a conquest of land while friends die she slipped out of her pauldrons and turned around to help thrand from his leather chest piece  thrands brow creased in confusion and concern but he turned and lifted his arm to allow her access to the buckles he couldnt quite reach hold on i didnt say we do nothing i agree with you what you say is true our clan has a longstanding history with pack longfang you and i both know this but it doesnt change the fact that our place is here unless thrands voice trailed for a moment and paused as he thought about it  and said fritha as she worked on the buckles  sorry i was collecting my thoughts unless we proved to either the prince or the chieftains maybe even the warleader that something like this is important enough to send warriors to perhaps if the interests of the clan if the defense of our allies is important enough to them they would listen you have a meeting with the chieftains later right said thrand  frithas eyes lit up i do she turned her attention to her greaves her movements picked up pace as she now had a goal in mind do you think they will agree to it  thrand paused to think for a moment that depends from what i have heard about the prince he is not one to take lightly to us leaving the contract we signed with him you read it i read it we are bound by paper to the prince just as much as we could be bound by honor so if we take leave early i think it will cause a lot of trouble and at the very least we would have to forfeit any of our earnings from this campaign it isnt fair but it was what we agreed to if you can convince the chieftains to approach the warleader about this that is our best shot convince him not to let us go on our own way but instead to see the importance in moving warriors to help this cause the more leverage you have within the clan the better our odds at being able to leave and not have it create a problem we may only be able to take volunteers or a small warpack and ship said thrand  ok i will go and talk to any stormjarl chieftain i can find to explain the situation if we can get a couple chieftains to agree with us then we can go to bolverk and hopefully he will hear us out with an open ear he understands honor and a contract but the situation has changed if the mordok are not stopped at onsallas then how far will they go until they are they have to see the logic in that as far as the prince goes he can keep his precious silver i came here with you to strike back for stormjarl and to help our clan secure land if we could at the very least hit one of grimwards allies that was done we have lost the push and we have probably secured all the land we can get without losing a lot more warriors there are a lot of capable people here who can defend what we have taken i am not downplaying the fact that we are leaving and hopefully with a few fighters we should talk to throm about this i think he might be agreeable to it he said he would join us in the campaign to repay us for rescuing him from grimward captors i think he would be willing to volunteer and go with us as well by now fritha had stripped off her sweat soaked clothing to quickly wipe off and put on more presentable clothing before talking to the chieftains this will not be easy to convince them of the importance of this i know they will not be happy to lose any more warriors than they already have to death and wounds to lose such a good healer as you are but i feel it needs to be done the mordok have been changing the tactics they are doing is not normal for them something is going on the corruption sites are growing in number and the corruption itself seems to be getting stronger you saw aimerick her eyes cast downward at the memory this needs to be stopped above all else this is more important than revenge or conquering new land our people need help selena and reyna were working hard to fight it now with selena missing or worse  thrand eyed fritha intently listening to her words i know my love and i agree with you i think this is a sound plan and worth a try start with one of the chieftains and if that doesnt work go to one of the jarls the subtle difference in their stations could matter quite a bit ill try to assess the plan as well and see what i can do to prepare for it i think the more we do to make this easy to agree with and show that this is well thought out the better thrand spent a few moments thinking and removing his armor while fritha was changing he had the urge to cast his runes to see what they said but in this instance he decided not to while thrand was a believer in the runes he was also an advocate of free will sometimes you had to trust yourself and not an outside influence go for it bend some ears and youre right the prince can keep his silver clan stormjarl did the heavy lifting for his ambitious contract weve done our job now we have friends in need ill tend to our armor and weapons and meet up with you later while you are at it try to convince them that sending us off with a small wagon or travois and some supplies would also be a good way to help  supplies are greatly needed i will see if i can acquire some the worth of the longfangs are not lost on any of the stormjarl fritha walked over to her mate and leaned her forehead onto his the last few years have been more chaotic than i have ever imagined but they have been bearable because i have had my best friend and mate with me through it all she kissed his forehead and stood back  ok lets go see about saving our friends she said as she made her way to the tents door  the endthe clan stormjarl and new aldorian campaign in april of 265 2016 players were given the chance to pledge their pcs or faction unitsresources to a 23 month contract that would see them sailing into clan squallborn territory they would either be helping to invade and conquer lands alongside clan stormjarl warriors and new aldorian soldiers or helping with the administration and logistics of organizing the campaign and the needed supplies pcs featured in the story volrok hinrich clypeum legis anne cash thrand stormjarl fritha stormjarl aimerick bordeaux marcus clearbrook brodin fizzlewick sakai sakura throm nightriver alexander vallen caster rex laertes ofrik and santiago ruiz player factions featured in the story the phoenix and the crimson shades  spring had come in full force now that the bite of winter which seemed to cling on much longer this season was finally gone plants everywhere bloomed animals and insects scurried about and life was visible everywhere spring crops were already beginning the buds sprouting and plants coming in showcasing the potential harvests that could give yield throughout the year this was pleasing to the chieftains of clan stormjarl and the nobles of new aldoria as these signs of a good fall harvest further reinforced the successes of the campaign since the beginning of april boats loaded with warriors and supplies landed on clan squallborn shores and conducted a blitzkrieg campaign to take as much land and as many villages and settlements as possible without warning clan squallborns lands have been seized quickly and the defenders driven north over a third of clan squallborn lands have been taken and are under the control of clan stormjarl new aldoria their allies and those who took up the contract in return for promise of coin however as the campaigns initial successes raised the spirits of those involved and saw large sums of loot and reward the defenses of the clan have become more organized more well trained and more desperate in the defense of their homeland the blitzkrieg has begun to stall on all fronts meaning that the campaign must shift its focus or recalculate its plans the sprawling camp that had been hastily created on the coast of clan squallborn was a constant bustle of activity boats arrived with supplies warriors of stormjarl and soldiers of new aldoria moved to and from different deployments wagons were loaded and unloaded and representatives for several groups shuffled about and tended to multiple duties you shouldnt put that there said santiago in a monotone voice as he bit off a hunk of a huge block of cheese casually watching a nearby caravan leader struggling with a way to load supplies onto his wagon the mans head shot up with an indignant look on his face and strained with the effort of the heavy load bugger off i been drivin carts me ole life i aint listenin to no barefoot grub the likes of you the man grunted with the effort of shifting the load a huge sack of oats and grain onto the front end of the cart content on stubbornly showing the cheeseeating man he knew what he was talking about with a quick clapping of his hands to dust off the dirt he examined his work and seemed pleased his workers tugged on the cart and began to pull it down the wellworn road this is when the cart wheels hit the ruts shifted the heavy load violently forward onto the base of the handles where the weight is not meant to rest an audible snap and crunch was heard when at one wheel broke and the brace holder the other wheel in place snapped off the body of the cart absent a wheel the entire cart toppled to the side and the huge sacks of oats spilled forward onto the dirt along with the other crates and wares the cart was carrying told you so replied santiago as he took a bite off of a two foot long sausage which he somehow procured from his burlap sack he watched the caravan leader have a fit in front of him rattling off curses and obscenities and kicking the cart nearby a set of wagons adorned in gold and red decorations moved down the street the phoenix wagons loaded full with supplies offloaded from the recent ships that arrived had been busy since the day they landed two men heard the commotion of the caravan leader and his cart and broke off from the wagons and walked closer their tipped ears and colorful attire were instantly recognizable as members of the phoenix siala kaynu and good day sir i see you have run into some trouble with your cart would you like some assistance in moving your wares free of charge off course this time at least chuckled ofrik in jest as he nodded his head in the traditional syndar greeting the caravan leader had calmed down a touch but had a sour look on his face he looked passed the syndar talking to him at the size and quality of the wagons knowing his cart would be hard pressed to move the kind of goods that they could instead of further causing a stink or sassing off about how the phoenix might be trying to dip into his profits he agreed and quit fussing good no sense in leaving your cart here in such bad shape well move your wares and the caravan guards can at least help you drag the cart out of the way replied ofrik with a genuine smile ofrik im trying to sort through these manifests weve been able to divide the supplies as needed for the two main parts of the camp however all the recent supplies have been building materials or supplies for construction werent we suppose to move weapons food and supplies to the soldiers in the field said laertes the other syndar who was attempting to balance a number of scrolls and read them with a puzzled look on his face we did but the prince and the clanleader retasked us this morning we are not taking supplies to the warriors anymore we are moving supplies from the ship and from the conquered villages i think our wineloving friend intends to stay a while in this land ive heard rumor of the plans for some new settlements replied ofrik as he turned and smiled at an approaching woman to some this smile would have seemed genuine but laertes could see the visage masked something else hello my name is ashar i am a representative of the crimson shades are we still on schedule with unloading the recent ships i need to submit a report on progress of construction so any delays are going to mean even more meetings and paperwork for my group said the human woman with a likewise guise of a smile covering a hint of frustration her stance had an authoritative look about it and judging by her quill and scroll she was expecting a productive reply in return you shouldnt expect delays the loads are being unloaded on schedule but the wagons could use a few more pullers should your group wish to see progress come about a bit faster and stretch your legs replied ofrik with a hint of sarcasm as the finer details of the tasks around the camp were being tended to by the crimson shades the wagons continued to move supplies and materials on the far side of the camp new aldorian guards were welcoming a fairly large group of returning fighters the unmistakable colors feathers and banners of the broken blade company and the gallant feathers of the phoenix were flying high as the soldiers marched back to camp with them were a handful of stormjarl warriors and new aldorian marines as well although they didnt look downtrodden they definitely were not jovial or apparently returning with stories of victory some of the small supply carts used for moving their food had been repurposed to hauling corpses as a handful of bodies were piled onto the cart at the head of the group was clypeum of the rangers marcus and brodin of the phoenix and a mysterious naran woman named sakura almost the entire time she spoke in a naran tongue that almost no one could understand but she was very animated with her gestures and one of her retainers was busy trying to translate for her i did what i could but he was so afflicted from the corruption that there wasnt much left to do the infections took too deep i am sorry said clypeum as he looked down at the corpses on the cart among the handful of dead lay aimerick of the phoenixs gallant feathers his face gray and dead drawn and sunken he was dead even though he had already looked it over the last few weeks corrupted with the new mordok magic earlier in the year aimerick slowly succumbed to the festering magic his wounds from the encounter at hazemane village two months prior never fully healed his skin covered in pus and rot it was a miracle he lasted as long as he did now he lay on a cart splattered with some blood and covered in green tinted bandages with an arrow sticking through his arm the rot and the blood seemed a crude mockery of the bright colors and feathers of his gallant feather uniform the other corpses were a mix of gallant feathers broken blade marines and stormjarl warriors totaling just over fifteen you have nothing to be sorry for friend aimerick knew what the risks were to be honest i think he was happy to know he died for a cause he was becoming so weak and ill from the corruption he had a chance to die with honor on the battlefield instead of in bed to illness said marcus somberly marcus was also a member of the gallant feathers brodin walked up to him his nice leathers and attire stained with mud dust and a little bit of blood and put a hand of marcuss shoulder i told him to stay back with the supply carts and he rightly refused he did his duty well and will be remembered all of the gallant feathers did in fact the rest of you did as well said brodin as he noticed volrok of the broken blade company step forward towards the carts volrok was a paid warrior an oclaochra so seeing comrades die in battle was not new to him he said little as this time but he would honor the fallen in his own way stepping up to the group from the back were a few ulven thrand and fritha stormjarl and also the large frame of throm nightriver who wielded a mean looking axe thrand had just finished taking inventory of supplies of some of the stormjarl warriors and was making sure the wounded had fresh bandages and fritha was helping to assess the current situation you and your warriors have fought bravely through this campaign we all have banded together and been able to fight back against one of grimwards allies that is no small task said fritha to the group as a whole as she set her shield down and took a long drink of water from her leather water skin so where are we going next we didnt get past the defenses of the last village to the north but after we get some supplies and regroup i think we can come back and hit it again said throm as he leaned on his axe pitted and chipped from use you could tell the warrior was perfectly fine marching right back out and getting back into the fight but he was not blind to the larger plan nor was he suicidal i dont know i am assuming we are reorganizing and changing our plans the squallborn defenders have gotten more organized and have begun to push back too hard for us to keep driving north now that their defensive line seems drawn i think we are going to reorganize before attacking again i will talk to the chieftains as soon as we report in to know where to go next fritha replied turning to look at ann of the marines captain anne cash nodded and walked out from the group and into the perimeter of the camp to report in with the commanding officer a man named caster rex was following her talking about digging tunnels and sapping more squallborn defenses but she didnt seem to pay much attention to him he was in his element and kept going on about the best way to use pork fat underneath a reinforced wall thank you ill make sure to bring that up to the commander officer should we need it anne said as her mind wandered elsewhere she wasnt entirely sure of why they were being called back or where they would be reassigned there was even a chance that they would load a strike force onto the demons run and hit further north her walk was cut short as the new aldorian officer she was looking for was stepping out of his tent and walking to meet her well met captain i am glad you and our allies are back from the mission to the north ill cut to the chase we are pulling you all back and establishing a line of defense we cant go any further north we just dont have the military strength to keep pushing at this rate we are going to start losing too many people to wounds and attrition and string out our supply lines get some rest and some food your marines are sailing back to new aldoria for more supplies youll join the rest of the ships and provide defense on the water and make sure the loads of lumber make it to the coast the rest of you check in with the quartermaster for your new patrol assignments and guard rotations the officer said and then he was gone simple as that anne stood there taken aback she was expecting a reassignment but not being pulled entirely back from the fighting sure the squallborn defenses had eventually become a real challenge and threat but to be pulled back so quickly before they had a chance to really try driving farther north it seemed a bit hasty of a decision she realized that the combined reach of stormjarl and new aldoria must have finally been stretched too far out both the allies dared not lose too many men or consume too many supplies or else controlling the territory would not be possible still she was hoping for a few more missions before returning but orders are orders the group continued to talk a bit longer but eventually everyone parted ways the bodies of the fallen fighters were taken to the pyres to be sent off into the afterlife volrok took a moment to give orders to his mercenaries when he took a moment to look out across the camp and the new lands as the day stretched into evening the future plans of clan stormjarl and new aldoria seemed to fully become evident those involved probably new it already but with stopping the forward momentum of the invasion really forced everyone to look at the bigger picture the fertile land and farms that were conquered the reassignments to patrols and defensive duties and the arrival and movement of construction supplies arriving daily on the coast heavily reinforced the ulterior motive of the campaign and the call to arms against clan squallborn well played volrok said to no one in particular as he walked back to the mess tent in order to get a solid meal his coin purse heavy and jiggling with the sounds of silver  the endthe smell of fire wafted through the village to many it would be indistinguishable from a normal camp or hearth fire but to atep oatcaller chieftain of pack stonesong it smelled different it was different because he knew how to burn wood to make charcoal some consider it a superstition or an old mates tale but those who manned the furnaces to make the coal needed for the clans metalworking network knew hazemane village located on the northernnorthwestern border of ironmound territory was back to producing charcoal and he knew that his clanleader would be pleased and that his pack had gained much honor and renown for their efforts production had only just begun but it will continue in earnest once the rest of the pack arrives atep was reviewing some of the production logs and scribbled some notes his belly reminding him that he was late for his usual dinner time he had two tasks to do before he settled in for the evening he reached for a new piece of parchment and took his pen preparing to write a letter he hesitated for a moment and thought back on the night that he arrived in the village trying to collect his thoughts he remembered the men and women sent to help them driven by promise of payment or in helping out his pack for a good cause they were there and they were instrumental in protecting his pack in the beginning it seemed calm and easy negotiate a fair deal for use of the phoenix wagons coordinate with members of the rangers or the crimson shades or other adventuring groups organize the work that needed to be done and quickly turned into a life and death situation none of them knew of the danger the mordok would present that night of the fear of being hunted and captured one at a time and dragged off screaming into the night despite the fear the group worked together and fought for his village he remembered the human smith who stood in the middle of the fight and kept his hammer striking metal despite the danger close by the many times someone had an arrow pulled out or a gaping wound closed by the strange syndar healer in the warehouse and the pack stonesong warriors who used their training to defend the village after being taught by the mercenary human and fierce ulven veterans they stayed and helped even if some of them did it only because of the promise of silver none of them got any sleep that night but in the morning the mordok were gone it cost him his entire coffer of silver metal but in the end the village was intact and his pack now safe and back into full charcoal production the adventurers moved on shortly after that some of them afflicted by corruption snapping out of his thoughts atep put his pen to parchment and wrote the following letter  gustave ironmound clanleader of clan ironmound it is with great haste that this message is sent on the trip to hazemane village the caravan was slowed by the large force of villagers and children i therefore took a smaller force with the daughters of gaia and support to go ahead of the main group to set up and get started this is when the group of adventurers who accepted the contract had met us and helped us take supplies to the village we arrived at the village and set up charcoal production tradesmen began blacksmithing new tools and repairs and we searched though out the village for tasks we needed to complete we found no bodies of the fallen warriors or any that our daughters needed to tend to but shortly after arriving we were attacked by mordok they have established a corruption site that is extremely powerful and they were more organized than i have ever seen before they attacked repeatedly but not to die in battle as they always have done before it looks as if they didnt want to kill and eat but to capture our warriors for their foul magics and corruption they captured 7 of our defenders including one of my own a brave hunter by the name of oto twotalon they were taken to the corruption site corrupted and tortured and then returned to the village at this time we cannot cure this corruption we were attacked all night and some of my pack members were injured several outsiders were dragged off into the night by the mordok when morning arrived all was quiet and the mordok had vanished we will secure our village of hazemane and force out the mordok in the area once the rest of my pack arrives i believe they are be gone but the corruption site will be there and it has great power we will try to cleanse it but my concern is that it is too powerful for our daughters the strategies of the mordok are also a concern corrupting but not killing our warrior and using skill and cunning never before seen i atep oatcaller will rebuild my village of hazemane and charcoal production will increase immediately my pack is shaken but resolved to make hazemane home i commend the actions of the rangers scouting and loyalty to our mission the phoenix were brave and helped greatly in transport of our supplies and arranging the defense of the village the healers and daughters of gaia were indispensable as many warriors were injured i will send more information as soon as i can and the first loads of charcoal should be ready by the end of the following month atep oatcaller chieftain of pack stonesong  satisfied with the message atep folded and sealed it with pineed wax and tucked it into a pouch he would deliver it tomorrow to the courier who would run the letter to the nearest settlement and see it delivered again his belly reminded him of an overdue dinner not yet old friend atep said to himself absently as he walked out into the main yard of the village on the way out the door he grabbed a torch hanging on a metal holder by the door to his house gathered in the main yard were the other pack members of pack stonesong the ones who came with their chieftain ahead of the rest of the pack they were assembled this night around a pyre and resting on top of it was oto twotalon the young hunter had been captured mutilated and afflicted with corruption by the mordok despite the daughters best efforts the corruption had sapped his life force and killed him atep walked forward with the torch taking his honored place at the head of the pyre preparing to speak out the deeds of the fallen ulven  endto read the first part of this story follow this link to the night was falling fast vazra returned with a makeshift travois from the woods it barely looked sturdy enough to hold a log let alone a body it was being held together with large branches scraps of soft bark and long prairie grasses the middle was made from white birch pieces and grasses vazra looked slummed perturbed and preoccupied but his return was as timely as possible i greeted him at the entrance to the outpost the archmage although preoccupied helped transfer faolan to the travois we tried to situate him as balanced as possible for the ride through the mountains for i was very unsure of the travois holding his weight we started out our travels at daybreak of three following vazras trek in search of making a travois we gathered enough mangled food scraps foraged from the remaining supplies of war and began our journey toward the spire the overcast skies of winter made for our journey to be relatively cool other than the exertion of carrying faolan and our remaining supplies we didnt overheat but the nights became cold faster than we had time for we had to make camp early i was relieved though i wanted to hold faolan i wanted to make sure he was still breathing i didnt want the vibration of the travois passing over the ground to rattle his soul from his body or render the travois useless faolan was doing as best as he could be doing for having almost died we laid the travois next to where our fire was to be i stayed with faolan and vazra left to get some burning materials i sat and talked with faolan about how the archmage was rambling about fish and doom i spoke about how i felt vazra seemed a bit preoccupied and perturbed and how i enjoyed the nature traveling back to the spire night after night i talked to him talking him asleep listening to his shallow breathing our fires made the cold nights bearable and the mornings as eventful as they could get the whole land seemed to be unbearably quiet except for our traveling noises the sounds of nature was all i could hear vazra remained in his quiet meditative thoughts i tried to maintain positivity but laying next to faolan each night wasnt helping my worry was more apparent after a week we finally traveled through the entrance to the spire we were greeted by the other archons and the guards the guards took the travois and supplies from us offering their aide in bringing faolan to the infirmary when they transferred him to a bunk the guards rattled something too much probably reiteration of the journey and faolan began to seize his eyes rolled into the back of his head his thrashing arms caught some of the daggers and one flew toward him almost penetrating his chest he stopped seizing but stopped breathing as well the archmage quickly moved everyone out of the way and completed a spell that punched a restart to his heart faolans chest rose into the air his head fell backwards as he let out a gasp of air i was screaming the whole time a guard holding me back trying to keep me from escalating faolons situation i was relieved to hear his gasp for air the guard noticed that faolan had a broken rib that was sticking out of his abdomen blood was oozing out of the wound faolan had lost a large amount of blood the guard put a rag between faolans teeth poured some wine over the wound and without hesitation or permission he pushed the broken rib back into faolans chest with his finger and set it into place he wrapped faolans torso with sticks and tourniquets to keep the rib from coming back out or falling out of place faolan screamed through the rag in agonizing pain then passed out vazra excused everyone from the infirmary except for him and myself sapphira you can stay here let me know if he gets any worse i need to go figure these fish out vazra disappeared from the infirmary with no other explanation i stayed and laid my head lightly on faolans chest so i could hear his heart beating it took weeks for faolan to recover from his wounds to pass the time i began researching ingredients for different potions in hopes to speed up his healing time i visited him everyday and told him about my discoveries i let wylder lay beside faolan to keep his spirits up i walked the spire day in and day out but could not acquire new insight or ingredients for something stronger than the health potion at least not yet i feel i am close when faolan did recover the entire spire had a celebration everyone brought food to share archon cider and some mead there was dancing and music everywhere you turned everyone was joyous faolan sat next to me at a table near the fire the fire was large and in the center of town next to the hot springs pool we watched the townspeople celebrate the health of faolan wondering where vazra had gone after leaving the infirmary so many weeks ago as the night drew closer the amount of townspeople started to diminish after faolan had something to eat we brought him into the hot springs signaling the night coming to an end and further healing of faolan to begin we took off our garb i unclothed faolan slowly so as not to hurt him we carefully entered the springs and i sat him down carefully on the stone seating we sat in silence captivated by the healing waters the townspeople realized the celebration had drawn to a close and started to wander back to their tents some of them wandered over to the hot springs taking their clothes off piece by piece on their way they are really drunk i whisper to faolan he smiles a little and grabs my thigh in the distance we can hear a boisterous voice coming from the side of the mountain but none of the guards are moving who is that and why are the guards not moving i say to faolan he turns his head to see turns back to me and says vazra vazra sees us in the hot springs and walks over to join us there is a woman trailing not too far behind him a little syndar woman as vazra draws closer he greets us with pleasantries vice mage faolan vice mage faolan how are you feeling this fine evening sapphira as he nods his head in my direction i am doing alright faolan replies vazra and the syndar woman take off their clothes sapphira faolan this is the beautiful moivira vazra speaks eloquently they sit in the hot springs across from us moivira sits in vazras lap vazra settles his hands on moiviras body faolan ive had a vision of awesome importance you see in the aftermath of the battle i soiled the outpost with my vomit but from that vomit rose arcane messengers with a dire warning the undead are upon us we are all in grave danger moivira seemed quite enamored despite the topic whatever her and the archmage were doing over there was best kept beneath the steamy waters vazra continued from the contents of my stomach i saw fish whispering of danger and then they formed together into my old adversary the death knight only now it was like undead but also fishy barf so like triple gross it was also smelly moivira was leaning back now clearly preoccupied the archmage is so wise she exclaimed while vazra went on with his story is it possible there is some unforeseen threat of the undead in this land stemming from your arrival faolan asked in a concerned tone well we cant say with certainty i dont actually know what became of my foe when i tried to drag it into the mana stream ideally it was simply ripped to pieces and consumed but these sorts of visions must be considered carefully their meanings tend to hold true in unexpected ways the conversation was interrupted by moiviras vocalizations faolan raised an eyebrow what exactly are you doing over there without hesitiation the archmage explained in graphic detailthe night was falling fast the fight seemed close to being over i was wrong the grimward allies were encroaching into the forward command post with force only a few of our soldiers could keep at bay but that force was not holding one of us was finally was able to knock a hole into the back of the post and some of us escaped the treachery or at least we thought i was one of those who had escaped through the hole i left everything behind much like i did when coming to this land i was afraid for my life we drudged through the woods farther deeper we went into the forest behind the outpost we were trying to gain as much distance between us and the enemy as possible but they did not follow our new enemy was the forest branches moss wet ground swamp thorns and no knowledge or direction to where we were headed we started to veer back to the direction of the command post we were now walking through the swamped lands my ability to trust the people i was lagging behind was dwindling quickly not that it was that strong to begin with faolan was not following vazra was beside me but i needed faolan to feel completely safe i was beginning to worry the swamp was getting deeper its grasp so tight i could barely put one foot in front of the other its water filled my boots and i could feel the gush of the muck between my toes i kept looking back towards the command post as we are now hiding in the prairie grass to the side of it i was waiting for faolan to see us wave to us let us know he was okay he never showed we are about to embark across a small moat between swamp levels i cant take it anymore i dont want to be here with these people i dont want to be in this swamp this isnt worth my life knowing that faolan could be dead i needed to be free of this swamp and my worry i began heading back towards the command post putting my fate in their hands just to be able to hold faolan again was worth more than what i am going through now i scream to the others they can do whatever they want they can kill me if they want lifes not worth living without faolan vazra agreed slightly and veered off as well mainly to keep me protected but he could not keep up with my rage i raged i raged for hours night continued to fall quickly i was close enough to the trails that i could see people they were not my allies i ran into the woods i had no source of light and my rage was consuming my emotions i became lost i waited in the woods calming myself against the trees breathing into them so no one would hear me i kept the command post in sights its black silhouette against the dark night sky it became quiet the noises are all of a nature continuing on as if nothing had happened at all the quiet continued i was still worried about faolan with the quiet remaining i headed back towards to forward command post at this point i just wanted to find him i walked closer to it and closer i could see a glint of light coming from inside then i heard voices trailing through the night the voices were familiar familiar indeed i started walking faster breaking into a run i settled my feet as i got to the opening not to startle my comrades as i got to the opening vazra rambling about fish and imminent doom greeted me at the door bringing me to faolans body it was lying in the infirmary he was found at the brink of death he was breathing but movement was absent i wrapped my arms around him and wailed begging him to come back to me i begged to gaia for his health to return my wail turned to weeping as his fingers slowly came up and wrapped around mine we laid like that until daybreak the healer tended to his ailments we rested vazra disappeared into the woods to find materials to assemble a trevoy we plan to bring faolan back to the spire to heal in the hot springs i am thrilled to be alive but i am more thrilled to have faolan alive for the conclusion to this story follow this link to saving faolanhunting trip written by tyler dubey it was raining that night the droplets falling like hammers against the canvas tarp of the pavilion lightning occasionally spiderwebbed across the sky giving brief glimpses into the darkness that filled the camp except for the pavilion standing in its center inside sat three men in chairs staring down at three bound individuals stanrick longfang sat on the right clypeum legis on the left and volrok hinrich sat in the center volrok glared out from underneath his decorative hat at the three ulven who were kneeling before him and his council each of them were lorespeakers each of them now had a story as to how they were captured and each of those stories unique to them and a member of the council in the pavilion volrok thought back over the past month about the events that occurred to them volrok turned his gaze to the lorespeaker on the right which was kneeling before stanrick whom was glaring coldly down at her the fog of memory lifted and volrok found himself back at the beginning of the hunt on that warm early fall day the sun was warm the leaves were just changed of their color and the wind was cool a fine day for a hunt they started off down towards the greatwolf hackles a bit of a trek but each day showed promise the longfang hunters seemed to have picked up a trail one that had been in use recently stanrick sent them on ahead to scout and discover who was frequenting this land a day later the hunters returned and they had interesting news apparently they found a hastily built shack on the side of a granite outcropping with a warm fire inside and a fair amount of books and scrolls he didnt hesitate volrok had the group move with haste to this shack his gut pulled him to this direction more than anything a mere hunch a mere guess once they arrived volrok placed the volunteers in places of advantage to observe to follow and to capture volrok had stanrick lead the forces on the ground while clypeum and himself waited on top of the outcropping so the group waited and waited and waited it was deep in the twilight when an event occurred the rustle of leaves the sound of the litter of the woodland floor being walked upon and the glimpse of a dim lantern the groups uneasiness about the wait vanished instantly for what walked towards the shack walked carefully the hunters later told volrok that this woman walked with caution as if she was afraid of something slowly but surely the ulven woman moved towards the shack the hunters started to move as quiet as the nights shadow that descended upon the wood then the woman stopped and looked around her she felt that she was being watched i did not know i was to have guests to my humble little shack not to mention so many of them she said aloud volrok was taken aback for a moment his first thought was that she bluffed trying to throw off possible hunters oh come on out already im old tired and am sick of hiding like this i know youre there i can smell the sweat and oil from your armors she said aloud once more this time stanrick stood up from behind the brush he was hiding in since you said you were hiding i take it you are a lorespeaker then he inquired she sighed at the obvious question and set her captured game down on the ground beside her yes stanrick longfang i am what you think i am but allow this ulven one last dinner as a free ulven before she is taken away to answer for what we have taught she barked with bitter words even volrok was taken aback by her words and allowed her to at least eat her meal the rest of the group slowly came out of the shadows and surrounded her shack as she prepared ate and slept for the night when morning came the old ulven had her books and scrolls packed into a bag her personal belongings as well and came out with her hands ready to be bound i am too old for this game of hideandseek i hope you are as kind as you were last night when it comes to the treatment of your captives she said once more with bitter words stanrick came forward and assured her that volrok and the rest would follow ulven tradition when it came to captives and treat her fairly volrok came back to the present his eyes still looking upon the older ulven woman while she was indeed bitter about her capture she cooperated and did not cause problems other than the frequent bathroom breaks along their travels to also be of note the books she brought were also in runes making it rather difficult to decipher them however all of that didnt matter he was glad that they got that one without much trouble it was the next one that bothered him more this individual was an older ulven man with a long bushy beard balding head and a blind eye this lorespeaker sat before clypeum and this story was rather entertaining it had been two weeks since the volunteers left onsallas in search of lorespeakers and their travels brought them to the lands of the goldenfield clan it must have been a spectacle to see a force of ulven and humans march this far away from the frontlines there was even a point when a small group of warriors grabbed their farming tools and confronted them on the reason they were there thankfully stanrick was able to help keep things calm before it got out of hand and they were able to camp near a river that night that ran next to the town volrok had been more than thankful for stanricks presence and asked the hunters to look around to find any evidence of lorespeakers nearby that had been their routine for a while now and it had worked quite well it in fact had brought them to this village the group had their orders and prepared for the day to come but the events that were to transpire that morning would surely be unexpected from here on out is where volroks memory had to turn to imagination for these events were related to him by clypeum apparently he woke up early along with the hunters in order to pray before too much commotion occurred he walked up the river quite a ways and lost himself in the scenery of goldenfield farmers that worked hard to harvest the grain finally clypeum came to a serene place where a creek became part of the small river he sat down and began to meditate and pray to his deity when he was done and was about to walk away he noticed an item that was out of place just across the stream there was a small campsite smoke still coming from the embers of a fire quickly he waded toward the place through the cold water fish bones a small basket filled with lures and a rod with fishing line attached littered the campsite well this is odd clypeum mumbled to himself who would leave such fine equipment laying around it bothered him apparently as it eventually led to him to explore the surrounding area alone that made volrok reem clypeum a new arse for such a foolish decision but his thoughts returned back to recounting the report he was given after some time clypeum did eventually find an old abandoned barn near the edge of the river from what he could tell someone came through here quite recently in fact probably within the past few hours cautiously he moved his warhammer in hand just in case as clypeum entered the barn a putrid stench filled his nose fecal matter urine bones and mold littered the place he thought that maybe a wild animal lived there that was till he heard singing dil dim didily dom eat the fish with the palms cook the bones and scatter them far see the future count the stars said a rather chipper old voice clypeum froze dead in his tracks he dared not move if only to make a sound do dob dibby dak i see the future there is a pact foes hurt feelings more there just might be another war went the cheery old mans voice clypeum had enough time to focus now the song wasnt coming from within the derelict barn but rather under it wait why is it coming from beneath the barn how is that clypeum pondered wildly and in a panic he slowly and carefully walked across the refuse filled floor avoiding anything that could make a sound he was successful apparently for he found himself near the edge of a pit thim tan wibbly damn running running avoid the brand stories told once i did never thought that i the old dirty ulven man stopped mid song clypeum could hear why the boards were creaking beneath his weight the old mans head slowly turned to reveal an opaque eye that glared at him wim pel bibbly bell look whom came to join hell you are human do not trust great wolf eat you yes he must said the old man in a slow and yet rhythmic way the words gave clypeum chills but he quickly resolved his nerves who are you why do you live here clypeum asked curious as to why an old ulven man like this would be here voop vam giggly slam i am speaker glam stories i told this is true but my question be who are you rhymed the old one who called himself glam volrok imagined clypeums jaw to have dropped at some point due to the constant rhyming but he continued to imagine what happened i am clypeum legis i am from the rangers if you are a lorespeaker then i would ask you to come with  he had begun to say when he was suddenly interrupted for while he spoke the old man danced around the mana flowed out from the old mans decrepit fingers and whirled into a single ball of light blue energy that hovered in his hand from there the ball of energy crashed into glams target and clypeum was then on his knees in the mud and grime binding his very physical being to be still as glam ran to a small bundle and grabbed a bow nocked it and aimed it at clypeum once the spell released its hold over clypeum he put his hands up and yelled i dont want to fight but apparently glam didnt want to risk it that or he was insane the arrow was loosed and sunk into clypeums thigh as soon as it did glam grabbed his gear and began to hobble away at amazing speed clypeum however was still pretty fast at a hobble himself he stood up and gave chase catching up to the old man however he had an idea to herd old glam to the camp so he slowly began to change his course from time to time to try and steer him and it worked when he eventually did catch up with glam he received a nasty surprise glam turned around on a dime his feet kept firmly on the ground let loose a burst of pure energy which flew like ballista bolt and sent clypeum flying backwards onto his back at the rivers edge just as soon as glam turned around to finish manipulating the mana and keep running he ran face first into a chest plate volroks chest plate as matter of fact he quickly tackled glam to the ground and pinned him down using weight alone volrok tried his hardest not to vomit after inhaling the smell and luckily didnt soon two hunters appeared from the tall grass nearby helped restrain glam and brought him not to the camp but straight to the river to be washed and cleaned volrok shivered and steeled his gut from the remembrance of the stench he gave thanks to the battlefather right then for helping him overcome that dreadful ordeal after that thought came to pass his attention turned to the last of the three ulven kneeled before them this one was quite young and seemed to be named yort the young one whom stanrick constantly called a pup was probably the most troublesome of the three lorespeakers to capture the reason that yort was so difficult of a capture was not his skill but his location after trying to talk with glam for a while the wily old ulven slipped some information information about a lorespeaker that headed north with an apprentice north to an old abandoned village in the great forest volrok turned to stanrick puzzled but was met with a look of surprise and disgust it was later revealed to him that the great forest is home to many mordok as well as many old abandoned settlements volrok didnt care he wanted that lorespeaker more than ever now for if one was pressed to enter into dangerous territory then the prize must be worth the risk volrok had immediately begun to organize the group and moved them north towards the great forest despite stanricks warnings volrok probably should have listened for when they arrived the hunters reported a decent amount of mordok activity in the area volrok had only then begun to realize how clever this lorespeaker they chased was which made him even more driven he took only the best hunters and stanrick with him from there on out and headed into the forest to give chase to this elusive ulven and his apprentice they were a day into the forest when they came across an old abandoned village the supports burned to charcoal skeletons littered the ruins of former houses mangled and distorted skeletons lashed to trees with vines and some sort of twine it disturbed them to see to say the least the hunters and stanrick seemed disgusted at the site of such a vile scene however there was something there that didnt belong a fire pit that had been used recently smoke still rose from the red embers which could only mean this had been used very recently the few hunters that were there scattered and searched frantically and cautiously for a trail it didnt take long to find one and it puzzled them for a bit for the disturbed leaves showed that one had a shorter and normal stride while next to it had another one one that followed the pattern of someone that limped along using a staff they didnt waste time pondering on that issue for too long for they immediately took off on the trail like wolves on the hunt they ran sprinted and even bolted through that forest as quietly as they could thankfully volrok was in minimal armor and wasnt as weighed down as he normally was or they would have moved much slower and much much more audible they continued to run their legs burned with pain and begged them to stop they ran till they finally found them the two they had tailed all that time the lorespeaker and his apprentice well it seems they finally caught up i was seriously wondering when these pups would catch up to us murmured the older ulven while he leaned on his cane who are they master lygari asked the young ulven male near him carrying a large pack they seem to be of pack longfang yort notice their markings on the cheek bones commented lygari he taught his apprentice despite the situation wait lorespeaker lygari i havent seen you in quite a few seasons commented stanrick well being a lorespeaker and traveling to record and speak of stories of old makes one quite busy especially if it is during a civil war lygari said with a slight sneer at their presence he had already guessed at their intended reason for why the group followed and tracked his apprentice and himself this far into the great forest there was a moment of silence after that the tension was high the hunters started to reach for their weapons lorespeaker lygari i would ask you kindly turn yourself in for questioning about the documents discovered and the lies the lorespeakers have spread i would rather we not have to fight if you do i personally promise that you are treated well and looked after during our venture back to onsallas volrok said to help break the silence and just get this hunting trip over with lygari reacted quite surprised at what was said shocked even that a human could act this way do you even no that is fine if you do not know me he mumbled to himself as he thought aloud very well my apprentice and myself will accompany you to onsallas for questioning though i cannot guarantee that i know anything about these documents everyone claims to be so important lygari stated as he hobbled towards the group and motioned yort to follow suite they traveled back to the abandoned village without incident apparently the mordok had not been as active as they thought in this area of the great forest the group marched onward past the village and into the night straight back to the main camp which was about eight hours away as the crow flew confident that they would get out of the forest unscathed how nave they were thought volrok as he recalled those events to the terror that they had gone through that night they were about an hour away from the camp when it happened a howl not that of a wolf or coyote but that of a mordok the entire group froze and realized the error of their decision to continue forward stanricks face was whiter than the moon that was peering through the canopy volroks forehead soaked with sweat and his palms quivered with uncertainty it was then they heard a voice run or they will get us volrok turned his head to the voice and saw that lygari had now moved as quickly as he could without out a torch through the wood that brought volrok back to reality and steeled him put out the torches use the moonlight to see its bright enough for us get back he whispered to the hunters who without need to be convinced did just that thats when another howl came and it was closer than before the group took off like a stag being chased by hounds they leapt and bounded over logs sprinted across the forest floor and flew through the air as they made haste to get to the camp however the howls were now yells and yelps followed with a course of other voices a hunter grabbed yort threw him over his shoulder and sprinted onward volrok did the same with the frail lygari on his chugging on at a steady pace that kept him at a safe distance from the mordok that were giving chase for a long time the mordok were on their heels they howled like mad and made a large racket as they chased them through the darkness of the great forest the group ran as hard as they could through thorn and briar through mud and cold they didnt dare stop their legs ached and cried in agony as they pumped them up and down then finally finally the sweet sight of light beyond the tree line moral began to raise the aches didnt bother them as much and the mordok seemed to have lost interest in their prey they got to the tree line and the rest of the group made their way back to the camp while volrok with lygari intow took a second to breathe that was all he needed apparently for in that second that volrok placed him down onto the ground lygaris hands began to move awkwardly in a flash his bonds were severed for while he was being hauled like luggage lygari was busy at work using the unexpected for that cane which he was carrying held a hidden blade lygari put the blade against volroks throat and glared at him you will release my apprentice and mysel he demanded before volroks gauntlet found its way into his nose thought to be stunned volrok rushed in low for a tackle to bring the resistant lygari to heel lygari had different plans it seemed for as soon as volrok was about a step away from going into the grapple with him he aimed his hands out in front of him summoning some of the mana he collected that day lygari sent out a wave of pure energy that not only halted volrok but sent him reeling away and onto the ground wait you can use magic volrok said shocked at what just occurred i can do more than just heave you around like a sack of potatoes now i want you to release my apprentice and myself we have no quarrel with you nor do we want to fight more than needed but i will save both him and myself if need be lygari went on obviously tired from the journey but determined to not be a captive of these bounty hunters he looked over in the distance and could see the rest of the group escorting yort farther and farther away from him sorry a contract is an oath i swear to fulfill by my choice along with the rest of the group who came with volrok said as he slowly rose from the ground seemingly to have regained his bearings for that moment now am i going to hav volrok went on to say but as he began to draw his blade lygaris hands went into motion giving form to the mana that was stored within him it whirled around in his hands and took the form of a white and blue orb that created a small amount of fog around itself in an instant as volrok went on to charge the lore speaker he found the world around him colder than he ever remembered it his body his senses his whole world seemed to have stopped as he became covered in a thick layer of icy frost lygari saw his opportunity and slid into some bushes nearby hiding away for the right moment volrok came back to the world cold angry and quite confused why have so many ulven males have access to arcane powers that thought confused and even unnerved him that what was supposed to be a rarity within the race was proving to be less and less true he looked around once the last of the frost left his body in attempt to find lygari that is when he felt it the cold touch of steel against his neck his eyes slowly rotated to the side and found that lygaris hidden blade was placed against his throat speak or move and i will end your life human lygari threatened slowly moving volrok towards the camp volrok complied but knew he had to wait for his chance to escape once they were at the edge of the tent line the rest of the hunters and members that were traveling with him were armed and ready what are you doing lygari growled stanrick who looked upon the situation with great disgust now while today has been quite entertaining i think me and yort will retire for the day so would if you be so kind as to hand over my apprentice lygari went on calmly as if nothing was wrong with the situation his eyes were constantly moving making sure no one made any sudden movements stanrick growled in contempt and motioned for one of the hunters to bring yort to the front of them and to exchange the two as yort walked over lygari began to move backwards away from the group and kept volrok held tight against the blade release volrok now lygari stanrick yelled as the group of three retreated into the night lygari only smiled and continued to bring both his apprentice and volrok beyond the fires of the camp and left their sight shortly after clypeum and stanrick along with others from the camp quickly chased after but found only the night and far distant mordok howls the three of them quickly headed back towards the woods volrok now bound by rope thanks to the help of yort while they ran he snuck out a knife from his boot and began to cut the rope carefully as they ran in attempt to hide the motions eventually they stopped and the feeble lygari had to finally rest up against the cane he used volrok took the opportunity to do what he could while lygari was busy and tried to catch his breath yort had the remainder of the rope wrapped around his neck and mouth and was gagged in an instant volrok then went on to quietly place his gauntlet deep into the boys stomach taking both the wind and the will to fight out of yort lygari finally came back to his senses from all the running and turned around only to see volrok tackling him to the ground like a massive bull the two of them struggled both tried to gain some sort of advantage over the other no spells for you lore speaker grunted volrok as the two of them rolled in the grass at that moment lygari heard it the sounds of pursuit coming from the direction they ran from he looked around thought for a moment while he tried his hardest to stop this unusually strong human from crushing him he then placed a knee into volroks gut and threw him over using the momentum the both of them stood up and volrok charged once more to hold lygari down now that he heard the sounds of reinforcements however lygari had planned something else entirely for as volrok charged his foe lygari summoned some of the last mana he had collected for that day from his core wove it and released another wave of pure energy straight into volroks chest volrok flew backwards at the sheer force and landed hard against a tree he suddenly felt a large amount of searing agony in his lower back then his head collided with the tree behind him hard he fell to the ground the power to move quickly left his body and mind another day human another day lygari said as he disappeared from volroks sight and into the darkness volrok tried to speak but only groans came forth he slowly moved his right arm to touch his back and felt searing pain and agony he bit down on his lip and pressed further towards where he thought the wound on his back was and was surprised at what he found it wasnt what was in his back as much as what was absent from it his fingers only briefly brushed the edge of the gaping hole above his hip and he nearly blacked out apparently the tree he was slammed into had a broken branch strong enough to tear through his chainmail and puncture him deep he groaned took shallow breaths to avoid the pain in his back and slowly used his arms to drag his body the threehundred some feet to the campsite volrok got only about ten feet before everything around him faded to black he woke up the next day his wound cleaned and dressed his head wrapped and his armor off and on a nearby stand volrok took a glance around the room even though his head was pounding like a mallet on a war drum next to him was clypeum who was rinsing out some rags and soaking them in cold water how long have i been out volrok barely managed to moan out about a day and a half we packed up as soon as we saw how bad you were and began to travel back to onsallas clypeum stated as he placed a nice cool compress on volroks head apparently you got a concussion and a pretty messy wound near your right kidney yawn says you should be okay for now but the daughters of gaia back at onsallas should take another look at you to be safe he went on to say from what volrok heard it sounded like he took a rather unfortunate beating that was four days ago now the group was about two days out of onsallas thankfully volrok was able to muster enough strength to sit upright for this moment he didnt want a moment to be lost despite the pain in his back and head so why why did you run when you knew you were being sought after volrok asked the three of them who wouldnt run when they are being hunted for something like that we are being called liars and are being herded in like cattle to answer for crimes some of us did not know we even committed said the ulven woman she was quite obviously displeased with such a hearing but volrok wanted no needed to know their motives then why the secrecy about what transpired all those years ago what is the motive for that he went on asking the more important question at hand the very fact that everyone in their culture was deceived for unknown reasons hin hel bimmidy bell one answer we cannot tell unknown to us this lore you speak someone higher up maybe but not us weak piped up glam that statement alone seemed to make sense it wouldnt make sense for lorespeakers everywhere to know the true reason of hiding the truth and that only a select few should be privileged to such information but why though why even tell anybody at all then is it possible that the last person to have known of the truth left these clues behind in hopes that someone would figure it out or perhaps it was left due to a guilty conscious what in the heavens and hells was the reason volrok thought wildly as he sat there in his chair while going through all the information he remembered something rather important fine then at least answer me this are all lorespeakers able to cast arcane magic volrok finally asked a rather important question one that has been on everyones mind silence filled the pavilion one that allowed them to even hear the deafening crackle from the torches and fire the three of them averted their gaze trying not to look at anybody hey volrok began to ask one more time his voice now much more menacing than before i asked you a question can all lorespeakers cast arcane magic fear began to manifest itself in the pavilion volroks anger was starting to reach a boiling point and everyone could feel it he looked first at the old woman then to glam then finally at yort volroks eyes glared daggers and even made some of the nearby hunters take a step back from where they were yort answer me consider this a chance to redeem yourself for the actions of your so called master lygari volrok now said coldly every syllable a threat in its own right volrok you are stanrick began to remind him reading the atmosphere in the pavilion he was however suddenly interrupted by yort i do not know but from what master lygari told me there are quite a number of us that do they sometimes seek out those that can cast arcane magic and those whom have the potential and train them to be lorespeakers cried out yort his voice filled with terror and desperation everyones faces went into shock the hunters the other lorespeakers stanrick clypeum and volrok their expressions didnt dissipate for some time finally stanrick spoke up if this is true then he began to mumble to himself then went into deep thought that means there is more going on than what we previously thought volrok began to add onto the brainstorm aloud bring them to onsallas i have heard all i desire to hear from the lorespeakers volrok told the hunters they began to escort them out one by one and when yort was about to leave the pavilion yort you did a very hard but very honorable action today be proud you spoke the truth volrok said aloud his voice carrying on not like before filled with intimidation but that of comfort the reason for this was unknown to volrok perhaps he felt the need to comfort the kid or some other unknown reason he would have to think on it after he was more healed up they were back in onsallass tavern now and everyone was celebrating the success of the hunt volrok sat in the usual corner with his comrades drinking quietly tonight he was joined by stanrick and clypeum whom were nursing drinks as well so did reyna heal your back stanrick asked him trying to think of something to say after the long trip yes she did my head is still a little foggy but my back is much better now that it has had time to properly heal and be treated volrok replied dryly finding that this is just small talk and that no one really had a reason for speaking silence fell upon their corner once again until sarmion came running in holding a scroll volrok we got a job offer sarmion blurted out as he ran to the table almost throwing the scroll into volroks face he took the scroll and went over the contents studying it very carefully his eyes taking in every possible meaning and phrasing of the document before him clypeum was in his own world minding his mead when he finally spoke so what happens now we know that these lower ranked lorespeakers apparently know little of the documents and that there is a good number of lorespeakers that can cast arcane magic he went on in a sort of overwhelmed state of mind we dont do anything at least right now volrok said as he threw down the document with a large grin on his face excuse me gentlemen but i have a company to build and a war to win he went on to say as he finished his mead and walked off both stanrick and clypeum looked confusingly at one another as to the context of what volrok was truly getting at they both grabbed the scroll and opened it only one part caught their attention in return for service the phoenix of fire isle will rebuild the broken blade company and have it made into a functioning unit as soon as you are ready volrok we will send them up to the pass to secure our supply lines may your banners fly high _ finvazra lifted his goggles from his eyes trying to clear his vision the rear outpost he had left earlier that day stood before him though it was nearly unrecognizable the once sturdy walls stood charred and blackened tables were overturned and the dirt floor had been saturated with blood forcing the mage to slog through the gruesome mud the bodies of his comrades lay strewn around the outpost butchered by blades or scorched by spells he was overcome vazra dropped to his knees against his will his eyes beginning to water where he thought tears would come however there was only a sharp pain in his stomach wretching vazra added the contents of his stomach to the mess upon the ground between episodes he tried to catch his breath inspecting his handiwork a pile of blue fish had stacked itself where he had been kneeling writhing without water in which to swim his stomach turned again and a wave of nausea washed over him he felt a wiggling in his throat working towards his mouth his lips parted and out poked yet another fish it twisted and turned to face vazra opening its mouth to speak they have found you vazra he has come without another word the fish wriggled free and fell to the ground flopping around with its last breaths an unearthly scream escaped its mouth tears of black flowing from its eyes as the life leaves the fish it settles to the ground lying still for a moment before erupting into maggots showering vazra with the larvae the maggots coalesced at his feet piling high to take the vague shape of a man watching the form take shape vazras eyes were drawn upwards ragged black leather boots were the first to form torn trousers giving glimpses of rotted flesh beneath following next chain mail fell into place rusted and mangled quickly covered by a gleaming white and blue tabard unsoiled by the death dirt and blood around it plate bracers formed upon the wrists the bony fleshless fingers extending from them grasping the hilt of a massive sword the blade seemingly forged from a single spine the blue and white crown sat on a skull adorned in a chainmail coif the eyes burning with unholy fire a skeletal hand raised slowly a single finger extended grazing against vazras chest the fire in the skulls eyes extinguished itself as the eye sockets locked with the mages own the hand on his chest shot up clenching around vazras throat with profane strength the mages body was lifted off the ground gasping for air my an unearthly voice echoed forth from beyond the skull and beyond the grave opponentas stanrick selena and one of agnosco walked through the camp they saw all of the makeshift tents of the collected warriors of nightriver they seemed to be in good spirits despite a number of them being bruised bloodied and bandaged a larger tent was chosen for the meeting location a ways away from the main camp although they appreciated the distance so that they might discuss with kragen openly they couldnt help but feel a tinge of caution it was fleeting but definitely present as the three of them approached the tent several nightriver guards stepped aside and allowed them inside one guard in particular was a grizzled veteran his beard and hair flecked with gray a leather eye patch covering his left eye and what appeared to be a horribly jagged scar once inside they saw kragen bloodmoon clad in his black leather breastplate and large white fur over his back he stood ready to meet with them but as they judged by the look on his face and the scowl he wore he was none too happy about it pleasantries were absent as he spoke chieftain stanrick longfang and the human from agnosco you have been persistent on meeting with me speak let me know your intentions and then i must return to my duties we are still at war i am well aware of this for this war has affected us all stanrick said my pack has been involved in this since the watchwolves and humans were murdered in the grimward great hall i need not be reminded of this fact however an issue has been weighing on my mind and at first i thought maybe i was just at the wrong place at the wrong time but now i need to know my people swore that they would uphold the finding of the honor duel and enforce the watchwolf treaty the only issue is it seems we can find no one that knows what happened you and i have fought as brothers together when the outsiders first came to your shore we burned our dead together and we let you into our homes as if you were one of ours but now i ask for the truth with the great wolf as our witness what happened that day kragen bloodmoon shifted his weight and visibly looked taken aback the three could tell that he is not amused that the meeting he finally agreed to attend was about this do you really think that this is important right now he said look around you stanrick longfang there are more pressing matters than the honor duel that stopped the fighting between our people and the colonists years ago that duel ended the fighting and that is all that mattered my war pack was there to witness it end of story now is there anything else of course that is important considering grimward uses the battle cry that the honor duel is a lie stanrick replied i was in your war pack i did not see this the fact that you dont see this connection is troubling stanrick stood firm his eyes narrow he strained to his full height i lost my family in that war just as khulgar had i made peace because of this duel who fought in it and who won selena watched the body language of those present trying to read the room having talked to grimward and khulgar myself she said i can confirm firsthand that grimward believes that something was not right with that honor duel so its time for the truth to come to light all of it one had remained silent thus far watching and trying to think of everything that led up to this point the biggest worry he had on his mind was before him kragen was irked hed have to tread carefully one recalled the conversation he had with stanrick and selena right before meeting with kragen he recalled stating that he had stressed to his most diplomatic spies who were the most familiar with branthur nightriver to make it clear that they would be willing to venture out and meet with kragen if they could be allowed access to the front lines agnosco had good relationships with several of the militia factions however realizing the ulven might have frowned upon that they would agree to meet wherever they could get access things happened so fast he felt he had gotten the summons before branthur nightriver replied to his spies he was curious if that was the reply time would tell one cleared his throat and made a partial introduction kragen bloodmoon i apologize for having to speak with you with the war still going on ive heard stories of your exploits and realize the harm of having you off the front lines i hope we can make this quick however i do agree with stanrick and selena if grimward claims the honor duel for the cause of battle would it not be best to start dismantling their very foundation for supporting the war in the first place a shirt is a shirt but pull a few correct strands and the whole thing comes unraveled its entirely possible these questions may not do much to affect the war he continued however if we can even get a temporary truce to look into the matter that should allow time for your people to heal mend armor gather supplies and spend time with their loved ones basically what it boils down to isim not a fighter mardrun is currently at war and i cant sit by watching everyone else risk their lives if i can do something to help i will if someone comes to us and says something is curious about the original honor duel then im going to use my resources and investigate every available option i have as it might make a difference one paused took a glance around and realizing the point was made let the others continue subtle differences in kragens stance and posture gave away that he was contending with some sort of inner turmoil mixed with an obviously heightened amount of anger short of stature kragen made up for this with a dominating presence that rarely failed to impose on others regardless of their size why after so long is this of such importance the duel is done it was a draw the nightriver champion fought a human champion and they could not best each other some say the ulven champion actually won rumors say the human champion did my war pack was there to witness it the draw between the combatants formed the truce that stopped the bloodshed besides do you think the grimward war packs give two shits about the honor duel anymore they are here they want war and they will stop at nothing to kill all of the colonists this matter is finished you would be wise to let this go kragen finished and visibly softened for a moment his edge gone i ask that you let this go we have more pressing matters he said one looked around once more and wondered if he should speak up first or wait for stanrick and selenahe thought it interesting that kragen seemed like he had wanted to say more not wanting to lose momentum he spoke before they did kragen i understand those were trying times and you seem to want to get back to the front to help your war packs i cant help but to ask why do you continue to state the same story we heard from various sources if you and your war packs were there to witness the duel would you not be able to say who the champions were from what ive uncovered from two independent sources he said my people had a female vandregonian soldier but im still working on getting a name after that i will try to ask her personally about what happened id like a balanced side of the story so no one will say the humans skewed our side of the history here on mardrun one paused here hoping selena or stanrick could jump in for their views stanrick showed no sign of giving in he took a moment to size up everyone then glanced to selena who gave a small nod he looked to the nicer war chief when we hold such things in our highest regard it upsets me that no names are given to the champions and maybe i didnt make it clear when i asked who but i wanted a name because the warrior who fought against another to end so much bloodshed should have each of us singing their name a human that had the courage to stand against an ulven champion should have our respect so their name be known you keep saying your war pack was there but have not said that you witnessed it yourself this would be fine if you had fought the duel however you speak of the ulven champion in the third person he paused now we are at the point that time is being wasted i have warriors on the front line and am here asking a question that should not be this hard to get the truth about he looked kragen in the eye clearly upset that someone who had been a friend for so long was dodging his questions each time you give me an excuse that this is not important and a waste of time he paused briefly that is where my time has been wasted stanrick was not at the point of shouting but his voice was raised he took a deep breath before he continued honestly i didnt really care much about it for a long time one day i was on the battlefield killing humans the next i was heading home to raise a child and my kid brother thought nothing until the day four years ago when you came to the outpost with humans in tow but no one asked me about a duel so i never thought about it it wasnt till the human here started asking me if i knew about this duel that i even began to wonder yet for such an important event almost nothing was known so i will ask a third time who fought in the duel selena touched stanricks shoulder if you boys are done posturing now selena sighed kragen i am tired my soul is tired i started looking into the war over a year ago when i was still a member of spiritclaw i left my position as truthseeker feeling unsatisfied because i never found the truth i thought i had failed for a long time it took me a while to realize that i hadnt failed but the focus of my hunt for the truth had changed that gaia needed my skills as a truthseeker in the world as one of her daughters i am here because i still hold the skills of a truthseeker but those skills have expanded i see what gaia is trying to tell everyone but they are choosing to ignore it she paused for a moment i opened the door for others to follow in hopes their skills could find something mine could not i asked the humans to look into the war from their side to try and find something i could not every story has multiple sides and the truth is often somewhere in the middle she nodded to one his group is the closest to the truthseekers that i have found i may not agree with everything they have done but they do hold the value of knowledge and truth above all else and most importantly they are using their information to help the betterment of their race as a whole that is more than i can say for our own in the past two years i have seen ulven cast off traditions and turn into whining selfcentered asses more concerned about their own images than doing what is right they are turning to bullying and threats before even attempting to be civil and just ask for help or say whats on their mind or gods forbid come out with the truth when confronted the lorespeakers have lied to the race a whole for gods only know how long their lies are only now slowly coming to the surface yes grimward may not give two shits about why they are fighting anymore they just know that this is what we used to doaccording to the stories but they also fail to read deeper into those stories to see what else we used to do i also know that not everyone on grimwards side is devoted to this war she said there was dissent and there were questions when i was there looking some questioned but did so quietly for fear of being killed i can only guess that those questions still remain since they havent been answered there is more to life than just the fight selena stopped herself but that is neither here nor there you dont really care either you are conflicted about something and are hiding behind the posturing of the notion that if you look intimidating maybe it will just go away selena leaned her elbow on the chair and rested her cheek in her hand i am not a child yelling at me to go away will not necessarily mean i will run away i am not scared i am too tired to be scared if you dont want to do the right thing because its the right thing to do that is fine how about you do it for your soul i may not be a truthseeker anymore so i dont know if i have the great wolfs ear anymore but i hold gaias favor lie to the great wolf and you get eaten but lie to the mother on top of it and there is no telling how her displeasure will manifest the truth will cleanse your soul kragen let go of the burden and when your time comes stand before the great wolf and the mother and you can proudly say yes i dishonored myself but i accepted my fate and i made amends the best i could selenas words rang true and seemed to cut through some of the tension in the room kragens features had softened a touch before she spoke and he seemed visibly pained by listening to them but he made no attempt to interrupt her when she was finished speaking he closed his eyes and paced a bit eventually facing the wall of the large tent and averting his gaze from the three of them i will make amends the best i can i will do what i must kragen trailed off a bit talking more to himself than to anyone else kragen took a deep breath holding it for what seemed like an eternity and finally exhaled his posture had returned to that of a more confident or assertive stance but he did not turn to face his petitioners her name was vanessa grimm and she was a sergeant of the vandregonian army he said finally she was the human champion that dueled the nightriver champion in honorable combat she defeated her opponent and pushed for a truce after her opponent underestimated her and promised her and her race ruin on the ulven lands her opponent was me kragen said pausing afterwards to let the details sink in after a brief moment kragen walked back to the table set up in the tent he looked down at it like he was studying the papers or items on it in our culture a warleader is chosen to uphold the honor and martial prowess of the clan they help the clanleader and the high priestess to be warleader has been the greatest honor of my life second to that is being a father kragen turned to face the three his expression returning to an edge but nowhere near the posturing it was before paying attention to his demeanor kragen seemed almost relieved to finally let the truth out but remained the imposing presence he wished to present to them when my war pack had run down a unit of vandregons soldiers long ago during the ulven and colonist conflict our enemies would not roll over nor would they have any chance of winning they impressed us to a degree but their ideals of combat and personal honor were much different than ours we killed them one by one some of us mocking them until a lone warrior called out a challenge in combat bruised bloodied and haggard this female warrior called out to face her one of my warriors was going to accept the challenge and kill her in a duel but i stepped forward instead i wanted to prove to our warriors and theirs that a challenge like this was foolish and that they would not be able to take on the warleader of clan nightriver the greatest clan of ulven people i accepted her challenge kragen said with an almost exhausted tone placing great weight on the final sentence of his speech i mocked her i threatened her and her warriors i disrespected her i promised her death and ruin once we overran her people why should i show her the respect i would an ulven warrior she was frail she was weak she was not of my kind and at that time we were so sure we would crush them and finish off these outsiders for good i did not show her the respect i should have and i did not take the duel as seriously as i should have it was a great fight and she was skilled she had the upper hand before i knew it and before me was a great warrior that i underestimated i could not come back from it in time and as our blades nicked and cut each other we both wore down i broke her arm and she broke my jaw and as i lunged a final time she stopped my blade and had hers by my throat i was defeated utterly and she could have killed me then and there the words spoken by the warleader seemed to weigh heavily on him his voice became a bit softer and his eyes seemed to drift to distant memories she stayed her blade she said she knew who i was that i had the power to speak reason to my clanleader she won in honored combat and would spare my life if there was a truce between our people in order to allow reason to win where swords had failed i agreed and said it would be done the fight was over and i was defeated i swore on my honor to uphold my end of the deal but i could not live with the thought of an outsider defeating me in combat and of being made a mockery in front of all the ulven people the shame the dishonor to myself and my clan to be the first and only warleader in our peoples history to be bested by an outsider kragen said loudly there was an awkward silence in the room until kragen calmly said bovna was my friend she trained many warriors and stood by me in combat that night when the vandregonian soldiers slept in the camp next to us she and other warriors crept into their camp and killed them in their sleep vanessa grimm human champion and the warrior who defeated me in honored combat had her throat slit in the middle of the night bovna thought that killing them would erase this problem she did not respect the humans at all or see them as equals her actions made things much worse but my actions did not make things better my personal war pack was sworn to secrecy that we would work to stop the fighting but that what happened that day would follow us until the great wolfs judgement the truce was successful and we stopped the fighting for years what happened that day remained a secret i would atone for my actions in time and gain my honor back nobody cared and nobody looked until now kragen said and nodded his gaze fixed behind the three people in front of him suddenly it all made sense each person there realized that they had made a mistake the lack of details the evasive answers the postponing of meetings and difficulty in finding out clues the meeting in a tent alone far removed from the others camped nearby expertly executed at once stanrick selena and one saw a flash of a leather strap move in front of their faces they had been taken off guard and were unable to stop it in time three nightriver guards had crept closer during the meeting and placed leather belts over their heads on kragens command quickly they tightened the leather belts around the necks of each of their targets beginning to constrict them and cut off their air supply all three of them realized that they were being choked as their captors behind them pressed them down onto their knees and tightened the belts still more i told you to leave well enough alone the warleader said stanrick smiled even in the midst of such a dire situation he was fighting the instinct to break into a fully ragefilled attack you wont even face me as a warrior lying is one thing but to murder us will get you eaten he said directing these words in an attack on kragen a flash a fear crossed selenas face as she realized the extent of the attack before it was replaced by rage she glared at the warleader with the glare unique to every mother which tells a person that they are in deep trouble she looked to stanrick then to one and then at the ground she chanted in old ulven with the gasp of breath she took but it was hard to tell if she attempted a healing spell or something of a different variety because she held it in containing the magic within herself one for his part was engrossed with the story kragen had laid before them which filled in the missing pieces agnosco had been half right many nights were spent postulating what had actually happened after the original honor duel unfolded it had bugged him and double for quite a while after cahal spiritclaw informed them of one interesting point he stated the nightriver clan had often frowned at his attempts to look into their past as far as agnosco understood the truthseekers were highly respected and had nearly unlimited access for them to be pressured to back off there would have to be something embarrassing they wanted to remain hidden seeing how kragen bloodmoon was the warchief perhaps a pup had gone against his direct order however they would have taken corrective punishment to right the matterexcept that wouldnt have been that great or scandalous of a secret double and he could never quite answer it but it kept coming to the conclusion that an underling had done something wrongexcept that didnt say much now he realized the truth if only the baroness would have gotten the details for the vandregonian troops that she was investigating sooner he thought that small detail could have saved them from the current situation one gasped for another breath trying to judge the position of everyone in the room he realized that even though things were dire he had something that would prove useful growing up his father was someone important so he was often drilled in certain steps in case of a kidnapping or attack such an attack would be carried out in hopes that the assailants would try and influence his father through him he was given a special brooch to wear at all times he had walked into the tent without any weapons it was doubtful hed have been able to take them in anyway no one realized the brooch pin holding his cloak shut was actually a modified piece of jewelry it was in fact a very small knife because he had the leather belt around his neck the ulven holding him captive would naturally see his hands raised trying to pull it free he only needed seconds to bring his hand down to draw out the knife brooch from the cloak and continue down and around to stab the guard seeing how he was kneeling the most exposed area was the ulvens groin though another target would serve should he have time to draw the knife and pierce the relatively undefended area if he was lucky the followup would be his captor bending over in pain in such a way that he could grasp on and roll him over his shoulder he needed perhaps three or four seconds for the stabbing as such he also required a distraction where the eyes of everyone present would be off of him to complete the motion as he stood before the three struggling captives kragen knelt down and faced stanrick who was struggling to keep the leather belt from closing too tightly around his neck i admire your warrior spirit longfang he said i long to answer your challenge in honorable combat and indeed face you as a warrior but it cannot be this way you and i know each other from a long time ago it pains me to do this it really does but i have no choice i made a mistake and i will be judged for it those that followed me made a mistake and will also be judged but this has gone beyond the scope of personal honor the clan is at stake now and this alliance we have built is fragile at best i believe gustavs intentions to be fickle and i dont trust clan ironmound to be allies forever i must see this through i must help branthur win this conflict and then i will face my judgement the future of my clan and the ulven people as a whole is more important than my own failings of honor he paused quietly surveying his three incapacitated captives and unfortunately it is more important than the lives of the three of you the warleader said honestly and with a definite tinge of remorse stanrick glared and thrashed a bit driving his guard who was having a hard time keeping him under control out of the corner of his eye he saw selena attempting to manifest her magic her guard watching kragen more than he was watching her in a bold move stanrick planted his foot on solid ground and pushed forward with all his might bringing his guard with him and knocking him off balance it was just enough to cover the distance stanricks forehead landed with a sickening crunch on the bridge of kragens nose standing and reeling back from the sudden pain kragen let out a throaty growl and covered his nose with his hand as blood flowed uncontrollably down his face the guard controlling stanrick regained his balance and pulled hard cutting off the air flow to stanrick entirely he slammed stanricks face into the dirt not once but twice now face down in the dirt with the weight of the ulven guard on top of him stanrick was stuck firm and quickly running out of breath selena took advantage of this to try to complete her spell and the only thing that she could think of that would help was to summon energy to blind or stun her guard after realizing healing magic would do little in her current situation her guard struggled for a moment and when selena twisted to aim her primed hand at him she felt a sudden flash of pain pierce her ribs she had been stabbed and she felt the metal blade sink deep into her flesh she cried out in pain and finished her motion opening her palm right on the face of her guard which caused a bright flare of light to blast him in the face crying out in alarm the nightriver guard dropped his hold on the leather belt and stepped back selena fell forward several feet clutching at the small knife stuck in her back one was also waiting and took advantage of the distraction he quickly reached for the brooch knife unsheathed it and quickly stabbed over his shoulder several knives first he felt it bite into leather then again it skidded off of something metal the third time it cut into and sliced across exposed flesh and his guard cried out in pain his leather noose went slack for a second and one lunged forward breaking the guards hold on him as selena crawled forward clutching her side one turned and backpedaled away from the guards moving swiftly toward her he helped selena up on her feet now at the back of the thick canvas tent one and selena were free and coughing to regain their breath this moment of respite only lasted a few seconds as the blinded guard had shaken off the effects of the spell and had drawn a sword and the other guard held his bleeding hand to the side and unhooked an axe from his belt there was nowhere to go it would take too much time to get under the tent walls and escape and stanrick was only several dozen seconds away from being choked to death selena cringed through gritted teeth and pulled removing the knife from her side she clutched the wound tightly holding it partially closed as blood soaked her clothing one looked almost ridiculous brandishing his tiny knife out in front of him as two armored and angry ulven began to move in cautiously i am impressed with the three of you kragen said as he flicked blood from his hand onto the ground his nose was broken and blood was still running down his face yet kragen had recovered completely and ignored the pain as stanrick struggled for every gasp of air kragen looked down at him and drew his sword you have earned an honorable death warrior and you two as well he said when we light the pyres for some of the fallen warriors tonight i will personally speak of you so that the great wolf may hear of your deeds your deaths will not be in vain this will not be a straw death for you meet the great wolf with pride and honor my friend said kragen somberly as he lifted his sword over stanrick warleader are you sure you want to do this are you sure you want to be judged as a murderer and coward said a clear voice amongst the chaos kragen hesitated a moment and looked up attempting to find where the voice had come from stanricks captor also seemed to be taken off guard and gave just enough slack to allow a lifesaving breath of air to reach his lungs the two guards closing in on selena and one stopped just a moment and turned a bit to see who was speaking at the entrance inside the tent was the older ulven guard the graybeard with the eye patch and scar he stood tall and confident and looked solely at kragen when he spoke jovin you know it must be this way we cannot afford to let this secret out there is too much at stake now you know this you were there you went with bovna and you killed the humans in their sleep why the change now said kragen quizzically and almost painfully i did because i followed bovnas commands i stood by and let it happen and my hands were stained because of it my honor is stained because of it you knew it was wrong then you severed bovna and sent her into the dirge for her actions she went alone willingly crushed because she had lost your favor then you asked us to keep this secret now you are willing to do more and kill more for your pride and your own twisted sense of honor you speak of the greater good with honey on your tongue while you dishonor yourself and your clan great wolf damn you kragen bloodmoon for you are an honorless cur and unworthy of the title granted you or the loyalty of those in your clan i will not follow you in this i will ask you one more time kragen are you sure you want to do this said jovin with a mixture of emotions showing through in his words kragens face was twisted in an expression of both shock and anger jovins words cut deep they went deeper than any weapon could cut his physical flesh after a moment anger gained hold of kragen and he leveled a fierce gaze at jovin i will kill you for those words jovin nightriver you will share the fate of these three now guards kill them all said kragen as he turned his attention back to stanrick who had struggled for just enough air to keep from passing out a fourth guard in the back and the wounded guard with an axe stepped quickly towards jovin the veteran made no move he waited until the two guards were moving to a close distance with him to finally make his move he did not move into a defensive stance nor reach for a sword to defend himself jovin instead grasped the canvas flap door to the tent and pulled it fully aside and open kragen roared a figure with the door opened it revealed the large frame of branthur nightriver himself time seemed to slow as kragen and his men froze a look of shock was equally shared amongst them branthur walked inside the tent one slow step at a time almost as if he needed many seconds to truly comprehend what was happening kragens guards lowered their weapons and stanricks captor released his hold on the leather belt stanrick gasped as precious air filled his lungs selena and one kept their distance in the corner but were no longer being confronted by the opposing guard branthur ignored everyone in the room and was looking straight at kragen the warleader suddenly appeared very small branthur looked timid and confused for a moment until finally a fierce look of rage filled his face he immediately bristled and looked ten times larger than he actually was although he only wore a tunic and no armor he looked like the most dangerous warrior that ever lived he suddenly moved forward with a determination powered by his great anger he walked past kragens guards who did not move to stop him he stormed up to kragen with a throaty growl whathaveyoudone roared branthur as he leveled a powerful punch square on kragens face kragen could have dodged it but never flinched as the blow racked his head sideways with a crunch and sent him flying through the table set up in the room maps tankards and small things left on the table went flying and crashing to the ground branthur stepped over the fallen warleader and grabbed him by the throat his meaty hand easily grasped around it and he picked up the warleader by his neck to place him back on his knees you you will pay for this you have dishonored me you have dishonored our clan you have dishonored yourself i trusted you you were my friend my brother and you betray me your actions are unspeakable you dare to lie and now this you would murder those that called you friend you would murder a daughter of gaia to protect your honorless hide i will deal with you kragen bloodmoon you will not be judged that honor is for ulven who are worthy roared branthur again as he slammed kragen into the ground further destroying the table and sending chairs flying not a single person moved for a moment except for half a dozen of branthurs bodyguards and several of the vandregonian officers that constantly accompany them they slowly proceeded into the tent cautiously approaching kragens men with weapons drawn detain them each and every warrior under the command of kragen bring me my branding knife said branthur who was oddly calm after such a display of rage and anger none of kragens guards put up a fight for they knew that this was over the vandregonian soldiers and branthurs guards rounded them up tied their arms and took them out of the tent kragen remained bloodied and beaten on the ground breathing heavily and making no attempt to escape as two vandregonian soldiers moved forward and grabbed his arms to detain him fully he did not put up a fight and instead hung his head in shame and silence after a few moments branthur turned to stanrick selena and one he looked tired and pained likely from the shock at the betrayal of his friend i owe each of you a boon stanrick longfang selena stargazer and one name your price he said calmly one was still rubbing his throat with one hand and his other hand with the blade still shaken a bit it had been a while since he had done something like that with the brooch dagger branthur i thank you for your timely arrival he said trailing off taking a deep breath to try and calm down more he looked towards stanrick and selena i wouldnt mind a moment of discussion he said in a steadier voice im not exactly sure what can be done at this point i originally began looking into the matter because i wanted to open an alliance of sorts with cahal spiritclaw and his truthseekers however the gist of the matter was that his people assumed it could help with the current civil war after seeing so many of our people dying around us as i was off the battlefield since im not a soldier i had to do something i never realized it would go this far now im wondering what part of this information is the basis of the grimwards willingness to attack he said continuing his previous point could we perhaps get a discussion going with certain people by that i mean that the grimwards daughter seemed open enough while at the serai outpost working with the adventurers perhaps she or others like her could be contacted through a grand moot which i believe selena mentioned the discussion on a boon can come later he finished then one paused so selena and stanrick could put in their own words now that stanrick was finally free he rushed to selena while pulling out a piece of cloth from his bag to tend to her wound he was breathing now and still letting this all sink in thank you clanleader he said with a quiet rasp the great wolf will know what you did this day he had nothing to ask for at least not now he glared over to the guard who had stabbed selena but heeled back on the burning rage that demanded that he smash his face with a boot i have nothing to ask at this time he said as he started to cough one saw what stanrick did and realized he could say something i just want to add one more thing he said he looked towards stanrick before selena could speak sorry i couldnt help you in there he said i realized with how they were positioned i could have broken out and either hit the door and taken a chance outside or tried to help your mate the idea with greater numbers seemed safer and i would have you owed you at least that much for not trying to save selena that is one looked toward branthur his emotions becoming increasingly normal im still a bit surprised you did show the audience you allowed us didnt make a mention of you making an appearance however ive yet to talk with my people who visited you earlier requesting this meeting so i may be a bit ill advised anyway is there something you wish for us to keep quiet about with regard to this at least until you can make arrangementsfor a new warchief he said still struggling slightly with his breathing selena sat there quietly tending to her wound after stanrick tied it off once she was sure the bleeding had stopped enough that she was not going to bleed out she slowly stood up she looked to branthur i can only speak for myself she said you owe me no boon clanleader if you had not come in when you did my mate and i would be dead and our children would be parentless i should owe you a life boon she sighed and looked with a great coldness at kragen before looking back at branthur i do not understand what our people have come to and why suddenly pride and anger have become more important than love and family i am sad not for kragenhe knew what he was doing was wrong yet decided to do it anyway branding is too good a punishment for him but this is your land and it follows your laws so in the end it is up to you however something needs to be done to put into the peoples minds that this current path of selfishness and pride is wrong and that it hurts the pack and the mother selena frowned i am sad for his children for they now must live knowing the sins he committed i pray that they do not suffer for the sins of their father or repeat them i am okay with keeping this quiet till you find a new warleader but i will not do so for long the truth needs to be heard she concluded her address with sorrow in her voice matching her words on second thought i do have a request said stanrick to the clanleader regarding jovin and anyone who had the courage to bring this to your attention please consider sending them to onsallas to train with the longfangs to regain their honor i also wish to be there when you pass your own judgement on kragen branthur considered each of their words and weighed them carefully stanrick your request will be granted jovin and those like him will go to onsallas and will train as part of pack longfang they are yours one you bring up wise words for someone that is far removed from our politics as ulven there have been talk about attempting a moot between the clanleaders or representatives on my honor i will present this to others and see if we can get grimward to agree i dont think they will do it without a fight but perhaps this will help selena i think pushing for a meeting amongst our leaders would appease some of my debt to you as well will it not said branthur as he motioned for the guards to take kragen away i do however have a request of you selena stargazer i will need a handful of daughters to conduct a ritual i do not ask this lightly and you may refuse but you will be given access to the rites to bury a criminal the implication was unmistakable when branthur said that kragen would not be judged he meant that he would not go to meet the great wolf he would be punished and buried as a criminal to the ulven people denied his journey to the afterlife such a thing was rare almost entirely unheard of and the true scope of dishonor that kragen had brought to his clan was fully realized and no more lies you are correct selena the truth must be heard i was deceived by this i should have looked deeper into it but the truce ended the fighting and to me that was what mattered at the time i feel a fool but i will not have my clan be made a fool any longer for this all clans will be given the opportunity to witness kragens punishment and know that clan nightriver will not stand for attacks such as these carried out against our people i do not know how clan grimward will take this but i will not allow it to seed further dishonor amongst my people branthur was lost in thought as he stared at the wrecked tables and chairs before him now go tend to your wounds and return to your people and should you accept selena stargazer i will send for you when the rite is conducted selena did not take long to think on the unusual offer yes i will help i will await word for when it is time as to the moot i do think it is long overdue i am sure the clanleader of spiritclaw will aid you in pushing for one one had been listening quietly after stating his opinion on communicating with the other clans stanrick selena and branthur spoke as he was partially lost in thought he was trying to decide if there was anything he should ask as a boon for agnosco if he was honest with himself he felt similar to what selena spoke of if branthur hadnt come then it could have ended in an ugly way he might have been able to last a few minutes with selena but most likely that would have been a generous estimate for the guards were elite warriors getting to stanrick might have let them last longer but with the nightriver warchief looming over stanrick at the time it wouldnt have ended well for him as one thought about it if jovin hadnt spoken up at that point or had branthur not followed himtheyd be dead one thought what stanrick did for him was honorable which got him thinking before one finished the thought he realized branthur had said something interesting one had caught the last half of the statementburied alive that sounded harsh then he realized that branthur had never said alive one remembered then that even though it was normal for faedrun to do so mardrun had different burial rights burnings were normal here and that was what the colonists were abiding by one wasnt sure he had even heard of an ulven being buried before that concept had to have been a strict punishment he or probably double would have to ask them later after they got back one heard a dismissal from branthur and cleared his throat in a manner to indicate he wanted to say a few more words i apologize but i wish to say a little more before we depart i appreciate everything you have done thus far i realize it may have been awkward to allow a person such as i access to your warchief being an outsider however as i stated before i hope you could see my organizations actions were only aimed at bringing the truth out into the light to perhaps facilitate a quick end to the civil war as grimward stated this as an issue for starting the war in the first place they were not done because i wanted to blame someone time will only tell if itll help start the talks if agnosco can help again just let us know he continued even though you mentioned you wanted to give us a boon for uncovering the truth i feel a bit hesitant as if it wasnt for your timely intervention i probably would be dead im happy enough that im still breathing however after hearing stanricks honorable request to give jovin a new start it got me thinking that everyone has had a role to play in this war so far im sure youve heard of the contributions the phoenix faction has made so far to the war efforts they have given silver supplies pineed sap and so on recently they ran into a bit of trouble during a convoy run to support the war efforts one of their members was overwhelmed and captured by some bandits in the area and is still missing in action if its not too much trouble could you perhaps put a small war pack together to rescue the phoenix member marcus clearwater i know how much phoenix members treat another as close friendsalmost as family i can supply what little i know if itll help finishing his request he said i do business with the phoenix from time to time and since many others do too i thought it might be fair to offer them assistance if this request is too much im sure i can find something else that is suitable one finished his words and began to turn to stanrick and selena the clanleader replied i am willing to assemble a war pack to bring back marcus clearbrook he is an honorable warrior from what you have said and likely has a great welcome waiting for him on the fire isle it is not so great a trial to go and bring him back one was slightly shocked at the ease with which branthur accepted his request but he said thank you most gratefully then branthur addressed the three of them once more in truth this time it is time for you to go i bid you safe travels and he turned away looking up at the top of the tent as branthur had dismissed them the three still gathered in the tent turned and left on their way out a nightriver hunter moved past them and entered the tent clanleader i have an urgent report the grimward forces have been spotted their withdrawal of troops was not a retreat was the last thing they could hear as distance muffled the rest of the words spoken to the clanleadermy name is marcus clearbrook and i fucked up well i am still living that fuck up so i guess you can say that im still consistently fucking up my hands and feet are bound around a limb of iron wood to which was being carried by two ulven to gods knows where i must have looked like a dead deer being carried home to be skinned and quartered the binds cut into my hands and feet to the point where i could not feel them anymore and my head pounded like the drums of the nine hells what i wouldnt give for a drink great wolf this human weighs as much as a spring heifer he better be worth all this trouble growled the forward litter bearer i agree i feel that we should just slit his throat and be done with it one less human to worry about piped in the ulven next to my feet hush up you witless pups this human is in league with the phoenix who are very wealthy we sell him to the headman at davons reach and get supplies which is good for us because we are down to our final rations chastised a woman who brought up the rear as much as i dont want to agree with her she was right i went over the events of the past couple days in my head after my group got ambushed by the bandits while attempting to fix the cart i got separated from the group myself and a young but fierce ulven female after we wondered the wilderness for what seemed like an eternity we were found by my captors i hailed them and they lowered their weapons claiming that they are friends not knowing what the brands on their faces meant i sheathed my weapon and went out to meet them at the time they seemed good enough we then joined them and went in search of my party we searched for an hour or so and then we stopped for a meal on top of a hill i noticed people moving down the vale that looked like my comrades when i told my ulven companion that i see our friends and turned around to see the branded ulven with swords drawn my hand went to my sword then i got hit in the back of the head and everything went dark i now know that branded ulven are not good people as i said im still living my fuck up i dont know how long i have been out the only silver lining is that these guys get to haul my fat ass around the wilderness to gods know where i should play unconscious for a couple more hours till they stop for a break at the moment i notice that i am parched and starving my two bearers dropped me expectantly my head hitting a rock as the result causing my head to pound harder than before i slowly stirred trying to get into a sitting position my body protesting very minute thanks for warning boys i said through cracked lips the ulven in the front of me turned around and kicked me in ribs with my hands and feet bound all i could do was flex my muscles which didnt do much fire erupted in my side and i swear he broke a rib thanks buddy when you go before the great wolf and ask to be reborn you might want to ask him for some balls cause you kick like a bitch i grinned through pain in retrospect i should have kept my mouth shut but i kind of want this shame to end my kicker drew a wicked knife and kneeled next to me i would rather starve than deal with your insolent tongue any further he reached forward to cut my throat i closed my eyes and clenched my teeth but the bite of the knife never came instead i heard a couple of thuds i looked up to see the branded ulven woman stand over me and my attacker on his ass holding his jaw damnation bartax we need this human pig alive she roared at him we have less than a day till we get to davons reach keep your knife in the pants or else i will gut you myself she looked to the other litter bear huskar give the pig some water i dont want him to die yet the ulven named huskar cut my feet loose and propped me up so the water didnt dribble down my chin the lukewarm water from the water skin tasted musty and unpleasant but it was ambrosia to my lips and body bringing new life to my limbs and lowering my headache slightly any chance to get something to chew on i asked him he looked up at the woman and she nodded huskar asked the woman to untie me as he went behind me and held a knife to my throat i felt a sense of dejavu as the woman untied my hands from the stick and retied them the knife rested against the right side of my neck and it felt cold i could feel my blood pumping against the blade almost trying to push the knife away after i was retied huskar produced a piece of dried meat and offered it to me i took it with a thanks and started gnawing on it the woman stood up and gestured for us to move again i slowly got up on my wobbly feet and gingerly took some steps the other two ulven started walking ahead move pig bartax said harshly i took a few steps forward and he shoved me in the shoulder i lost my feet and grabbed a maple sapling staying upright dropping my dried meat i looked at bartax and gave him the best stink eye that i could i reluctantly followed behind the other two ulven with pins and needles in my legs we marched for the rest of the day and by the time the sun had disappeared behind the western horizon i could smell wood smoke my captors probably smelt the same because they increased their speed and seemed more watchful we moved out of the forest line into an open meadow which sloped up to a hill and near the apex of the hill was a walled settlement the ulven woman looked back at me and said sourly welcome to davons reach pig hopefully all this effort to keep you alive will be worth it if not i will take great pleasure in flaying you as she said the last part she grinned maliciously her white fangs shining menacingly in the twilight i saw this and it scared me so thoroughly that i paused for a second my stupor was broken as bartax hit me in the back of the head no time to waste pig your fate is about to be revealed he chuckled we walked into the thick grass of the meadow toward the settlement no more than 100 yards from the tree line a man in brown and black leathers stood up from the tall grass 10 paces ahead of our group hold state your business the ulven woman took a few steps to get past huskar i am voska branded sister of gaia my branded brothers seek shelter at davons reach we bring a gift as payment she gestures toward me and says the fat human in red and brown rags is an important member of the phoenix the man in the grass showed no emotion i will send a runner to the headman in the meantime my men and i will escort your group to the gates as soon as he was finished talking six men in black and brown leathers with bows drawn stood up from the tall grass the speaker walked to the closest archer and whispered in his ear after a few moments the archer lowered his bow and took off at a surefooted run toward the settlement looking back at us he beckoned with his left hand come i was then immediately shoved by my captors my ruined armor clanking with the motion out of the frying pan and into the fire i dont suppose its too much to ask if i can walk back the way i came i thought sourly as a moved tiredly on we trudged toward the east side of the settlement my captors captors always watching with one knocked in their bows i can tell that voska and bartax were getting agitated not quite sure of the situation that they put themselves in me i couldnt care less i was fucked either way by the time we reached the gate the shadows were long and torches were being lit along the palisade the eastern gate supported two solid oak doors that were about 3 paces long by a man and half tall on each side of the doors a covered tower rose higher into the air armed with two crossbow men the left door cracked open just enough to let one man through at a time three men filed out the runner a burly man with a huge ax strapped to his back and finally a man about average height in black leathers the man in black leathers regarded us with interest ho friends i am percival von borscht headman of this establishment what can i do for you he said politely putting his hands on his hips hands not far away from a pair of curved short swords voska stepped forward about two paces from the headman the guards eyed her warily hands on weapons bows raised at her approach she straightened her back hands clenched into fists at her side i am voska branded daughter of gaia gesturing to her comrades we wish to join your clan if that is not possible we would like to barter for supplies what say you what do you have to barter from what i can tell you dont have much in terms of possessions percival stated dryly clearly getting bored voskas gaze never left percivals we have this human pig to present you he is a member of the phoenix and from what i remember of my time at clan stormjarl they are very wealthy we wish to give him to you to do as you wish i tire of his wagging tongue and foul smell she was right i did smell like shit you havent even begun to experience this wagging tongue i said loudly at her back i was rewarded with a couple chuckles from the towers and a hit in the back of the head from huskar quiet pig or i will remove said tongue you dont need it to live he said as he grabbed me and put his knife to my cheek hold your knife branded percival commanded while this is true he doesnt need his tongue to live he is worth more undamaged i also would like verification from him that he is a phoenix member bring him forward to the light huskar growled but removed his knife and escorted me the few paces to the brightness of the torch light we stopped in front of percival and got a good look at the headman of davons reach as i said he stood at about average height light build long brown hair tied back and an expertly trimmed beard he didnt look all that imposing to me but i learned the hard way never underestimate the little guy how do i know that you didnt kill a phoenix member and take his clothes percival asked as he took a step toward me and looked at my tatters i smiled and shrugged you dont i said simply but i am pretty sure i am better company than these branded scum minus the smell of course a toothy smile split the headmans face no doubt but i must beg your forgiveness for what i am about to do i cocked my head at him in confusion one moment percivals smiles vanished the next moment he drew a throwing dagger at the third moment it was sailing in the air toward me i brought my bound hands to block the dagger flying toward my neck i wasnt fast enough but the dagger didnt bury itself in my throat it brushed my unkempt hair to lodge itself in the right eye of huskar the blade didnt kill him outright but he screamed bloody murder as i dropped to my knees percival wasnt done though when i was falling he drew a short sword and sliced the screaming huskars throat his screams died fast as he fell to the cold ground his warm blood fountaining from his body betrayal bar voska yelled as she tried to draw her blade the big guy with the huge ax stepped forward and punched her out with a leather gauntlet to the temple of her head she fell silently and laid still i looked back to where bartax was he was on his knees with six arrows shafts protruded from his chest and back i felt my heart beating like a humming birds wings my previous captors were dead or unconscious in less time than it takes me to piss my bound hands were next to my left ear exactly where i felt the dagger wiz past my head my breath coming out in ragged breaths and my eyes wild with fear looking for an escape percival walked over to huskars corpse and wiped his bloodied blade clean on the dead mans trousers sheathing his blade he smiled down at me then offered me his hand i looked at his hand back up to him and grabbed his hand my legs were unsteady he looked at me with his cold calculating blue eyes now before we go in i want you to be honest with me are you in league with the phoenix his voice very neutral without a hint of malice i returned his gaze trying not to show fear i am in league with the phoenix but i am not a member of their group i am a paid warrior that is employed by the phoenix a gallant feather i reached up and showed him my tattoo over my heart a red feather as far as i knew i was the only one to get a feather tattoo over my left breast i got the tattoo to signify my new home and that i was proud of being a gallant feather im pretty sure i was the only one in the organization that had this tattoo but percival didnt know that i kept my face stern like i had shown something to von borscht that few people ever see well other than the occasional tavern wench it was trueish he looked at me in the eyes for a moment his deep brown eyes betraying nothing then he smiled and said as he lead my through the gates his arm around my shoulder welcome to davons reach im sure we will work well together his sudden change in behavior really made me wary of his temperament and i decided that i should really try to stay in his good graces on the other side of the wooden doors the first thing i noticed was the smell of cooked meat and stews my mouth started to fill with saliva as my stomach started to audibly protest to the lack of sustenance percival must have heard the sounds coming from my stomach as he patted me on the back marcus please join me for dinner we have much to discuss while i go make the preparations i would like it if you freshened up at the creek he said as he turned to big and ugly with a huge fucking ax and said corin please take some men and our guest to get freshened up at the river also supply him with different attire for the evening corin put a hand on me and i stopped immediately von borscht didnt even notice the transaction as he strode confidently through the dilapidated settlement i turned around toward corin and gave him the best smile i could so youre the sorry shit that gets to watch me wash my ass corin gave me a huge smile full of crooked broken teeth thats only if you dont try to run off i would hate to explain to the boss how you drowned and then was hacked into pieces he then gave me a scowl and turned me back toward the gates as i walked out the gates again i noticed that the bodies of bartax and huskar were disposed of all that was left was a flat patch of broken red grass yup if i plan to make it out of this place alive i will have to play the next few hours very cautiously heh never a dull moment right i asked myself as i trudged through the nightreyna bryech called his packmate over to him as wargah and her companions prepared to leave the maykar outpost he was going with her and wanted to get something off his chest before he did reyna approached him with a smile and commented i literally just found you and now youre going off on your own again bryech smiled and clasped her forearm in the standard ulven greeting and in this case farewell bryech wasnt planning on a witty dialogue with reyna he wanted to get to the point reyna im leaving pack longfang i dont want any conflict with any of you i just need to move on bryech says causing reyna a moment of shock without waiting for a response bryech placed his left hand on the outside of her forearm i know this is sudden however my honor debt to pack longfang is more than paid bryech knew it was curt but he knew that the words would mean something to the people who would hear them he left catching up with wargah at the head of her party or what was left of it after the expedition the alpha fight was brutal and many warriors fell on both sides but in the end the expedition triumphed a fact that was still shocking to bryech as he recounted the harrowing fight while he walked the grimward party broke camp a few hours after leaving the outpost the sun had just reached its highest point when wargah gave the word though theyd only been on the road a few hours they all knew why they were really stopping behind them a small sled carrying three corpses of fallen grimward warriors this expedition had not been easy the grimward set about to making their camp defensible for the night bryech set to work beside them he didnt care what side of the war they were on he wanted to make sure the fallen received proper respects the work was brutal in the sun but it was something bryech was familiar to after setting up the defenses the group was given the nights rations and set about eating them bryech sat away from his kinsmen his life had trained him to be solitary alone there was no place for fickle talks and friendships in a warriors life bryech contemplated everything hed done in his life the brothers and sisters in honor hed lost the war had taken so much from this life bryechs thoughts were interrupted by a sudden rise in the voice of one of the grimward someone remind me why we have this outsiderloving coward in our party bryech looked to the source of the voice a large warrior with many scars on his face bryech sized him up from where he sat the warrior saw this and stood attempting to intimidate bryech with his stature he was strong one could tell by looking at him bryech was unimpressed and not at all afraid hed seen far too much war to be afraid of bluster bryech stood to confront his kinsman and didnt hesitate to answer his challenge dont start something you arent going to finish friend you think yourself a more capable warrior than i the warrior looked to the growing circle of his fellow grimward and then back to bryech i am tolfdir stormhowl the eldest son of gunjar stormhowl tolfdir hollered and what have you done to make you so great tolfdir bryech replied with the beginnings of a snarl i was a conqueror in the battles against the watchwolf traitors tolfdir replied increasing the amount of effort in attempting to scare bryech into submission an illadvised move for bryech had lost his sense of fear long ago the other warriors had now become invested in the challenge that was being called a pawn used to commit the will of a man drunk on making his own legend bryech roared back shocking tolfdir slightly as well as few of the watching warriors ive killed men like you and held better men dying in my arms bryech continued beginning to circle his foe his rage building the fire in his heart burning brighter do you know why there is even a war in the first place because men like haygreth and branthur want to be immortalized in glory they care not for you or me or the colonists they would let all of us die just to say they were on the winning side bryech was now seething you speak as if your opinion matters boy tolfdir growled in response slowly drawing his sword from his belt as well as his knife my feats are many tolfdir stormhowl ive killed countless mordok all over this land ive trained the ulfendnar of pack longfang and i bryech savagefang son of davrik savagefang am one of the few if not the last survivor of the battle of black wolf creek bryech roared grabbing a hatchet that was buried in a nearby log the warriors murmured amongst themselves after bryech named his last deed nobody survived black wolf creek tolfdir screamed and charged at bryech with a bellowing cry bryech answered with his own roar and charged as well tolfdir swung down in an attempt to bury his sword into bryechs shoulder but his attack was blocked easily by the crook of the hatchet bryech wielded bryech then kicked out and struck tolfdir in his lower gut causing the great warrior to take a few steps back and his dagger to miss bryechs throat by inches bryech advanced and swung the axe two handed causing tolfdir to drop his dagger after a weak attempt at a parry tolfdir retaliated quickly punching bryech in the jaw with the sword handle reinforcing his fist the blow rattled bryech and caused him to stagger and spit blood tolfdir stood waiting for bryech to regain himself and was not left waiting long bryech spit out more blood as he stood the pain was almost nonexistent but still there bryech rushed forward again this time attacking first with an overhead swing tolfdir turned his blade and placed the flat into his other hand to anvil block the attack the sword caught in the crook of the axe and tolfdir had done exactly what he had intended to do tolfdir flipped the axe back and over bryechs head bringing it back and crushing it against bryech bryech howled in pain as his foe began to crush him with his sheer force bryech struggled for what seemed like an eternity until he realized tolfdir couldnt defend his face bryech slammed his forehead into tolfdirs nose causing a resonating crunch and gush of blood that covered bryechs shoulder as the two warriors separated bryech regained his footing quickly to witness his foe holding his broken nose as blood spilled between his fingers bryech picked tolfdirs sword off the ground stood tall and said a monster did bryech rushed forward and thrust the sword into tolfdirs gut placing his left hand on tolfdirs shoulder to gain leverage bryech then leaned in and said tell the great wolf that bryech savagefang sent you to him on this day without waiting for any sort of response bryech pushed the sword down to the hilt and kicked tolfdir stormhowls corpse onto the ground letting the sword fall with him it seems you already have the answers to your questions kinsman wargah said as she stepped into the circle that had formed bryech looked at her and growled he knew she was right his fears had been realized give me a map i know you have a few with you bryech replied not wanting to discuss the hell that was their heritage wargah sent one of her warriors away hopefully to return with a map why do you fight for the wrong side wargah asked when her runner returned she held the map out to bryech as if wanting him to make a choice i fight because my heart tells me i must and my heart doesnt wish to fight for another mans glory bryech replied taking the map and unrolling it after scanning it quickly he began to walk south but was stopped when wargah called his attention bryech take this tossing him a bag full of trail rations gifts from the dead bryech turned around once again and began walking south towards ironmound territory without replying bryech knew his fight was far from over and the fire in his heart burned brighter than ever read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1141storycolebeckyixzz3oqy5lszculven sagas and texts recovered during the june 264 expedition into the dirge swamp sagas written by tim cochranehello at the gate i swear to you we are not mordok or bandits we just want a room its fucking cold and wet out here marcus bellowed at the northern gates of newhope very subtle you know its really late in the night they may not have a guard out i said as i held my cape over my other hand to shield my magefire from the wind and rainwe should have camped out again found a dryer bunch of pines to sleep under marcus turned away from the large gates his features mostly shrouded in darkness as my magefire continuously flickered in the chilly spring wind dropping his large pack to the cobblestone street he exclaimed to hell with that youre barely keeping your flame alight and i will be damned if i wake up with a pine cone up my ass again which wouldnt be the case if your aim was better i exhaled a moment and remembered how the tent got destroyed after the ruckus that was caused at the ironmound feast we went with the escort taking the nightriver representative back to their territory which wasnt without conflict they were constantly hounded by grimward and wild animals we had managed to either outmaneuver or avoid most of grimwards advances but there had been a few minor skirmishes one such instance happened when we were a days walk from nightriver territory we had just had our rations and were looking to turn in for the night since our supplies had been limited and not everyone had a tent many of us had to double up in tents this was not very ideal since marcus snores very loudly anyway we were about to turn in when a guard screamed briefly before being silenced both marcus and i emerged from the tent with our weapons minus our boots and yelled that an attack was happening losing the element of surprise a handful of grimward attacked war cries filling the night our group was able to dispatch of them fairly quickly marcus was in the process of fighting one of the last ones when this larger than usual ulven stomped on his exposed right foot marcus howled in pain and fell to the ground i primed a stun bolt and threw it before the looming ulven could finish off my friend solara take me i dont know how i missed that throw the bolt flew over his left shoulder and landed in dying campfire which caused it to explode showering the camp in sparks and embers everyone was shocked for a couple seconds except for the nightriver representative who snuck up behind the grimward warrior standing over marcus and slit his throat she started helping marcus to his feet favoring his wounded foot when the tents started on fire it had been very dry as of late and many of the tents were made of canvas i tried to put out the fire on our tent but by the time i did half of it was gone a cleric healed marcuss broken foot and we delivered the representative safely to a nightriver patrol they couldnt spare any supplies so our best bet was to make it to newhope marcus said there was a detachment of gallant feathers that he wanted to speak with about getting a unit to protect ironmound so we struck towards newhope tentless and low on supplies gods above and below how many times do i have to say im sorry i yelled as the rain increased tempo i will let it go when im not starving and drenched to the bone marcus yelled back turned and rapped on the door spouting obscenities at the end of his rant a small window in the large door opened showering them in a yellow light from a torch holding a torch was a bleary eyed unshaven middleaged man with bad teeth what the hell do you want what is your business here at this ungodly hour he said clearly annoyed that we woke him up its about fucking time marcus said pointedly we are a couple travelers from nightriver we seek lodging from the rain can you let us in the guard looked between marcus and i why dont you use your tent and come back in the morning marcus looked back at me briefly we lost it due to extenuating circumstances and we dont wish to die of exposure to the weather and litter your nice road so can you please let us in the guard thought about our answer for a few breaths well i dont know i will have to ask my sergeant but he wont like being awoken i interjected before marcus could snap out an insult we would really appreciate if you could wake him up the phoenix would appreciate it the guard rubbed his eyes and yawned clearly not impressed all right i will go ask him it will take a while though you never know i might forget on my way he closed the window before we could say anything listen here you little shit if you forget us and we die i swear to the gods i will haunt your scrawny ass for the rest of your miserable pitiful life marcus yelled at the door before turning around and leaning against the cold heavy wood this is bullshit i walked over to the door and put my back against the door next to my friend and exhaled my breath steamed out in a cloud of vapor which dissipated in the cold rain there was a slight eve next to the door that kept most of the rain off except for when the wind blew i was really exhausted and was not thinking clearly my magefire was slowly flickering in this miserable weather i was cold and sleeping here seemed like a good idea marcus then tapped me on the shoulder briefly clearing my thoughts hey keep that fire going for a little bit i have to get something out of my bag if we are to die tonight i might as well die happy he bent down and started rummaging in his pack he straightened a minute later with a large leather clad flask he pulled the cork and smelled the contents his eyes widening as he did that innkeeper wasnt lying his wife does make a mean raspberry wine he took a drink and passed it to me i looked confused at him for a second before taking it where did you get this i asked as i raised the flask to my lips and took a small drink the liquid was sweet but very powerful and it took my breath away i started coughing as my chest and throat felt like they were on fire ha i got that from the innkeepers wife when we almost died in that snowstorm last winter i thought since we might die tonight it only seemed fair that we die drunk marcus spoke as he took another drink and handed it back to me also if i cant sleep neither can you misery loves company taking the flask while nodding i responded yes yes she does i took another drink this time i didnt cough but the fire in my throat and chest persisted i handed it back to him as i started feeling warm and giddy the alcohol was sitting heavy on my stomach after not having very much food in the last few days thanks marcus thanks for having my back and being there when i needed it he took another drink smiled and said no problem buddy im sure a lot of people would have done the same also thanks for watching out for me as well and keeping me in check from time to time i looked down at the ground and thought of how many people had my back the list was very small not as many as you think growing up was pretty hard and lonely after my parents died i didnt have very many people that would help me out i said still staring at the ground i thought all you syndar keep an eye out for each other he said inquisitively i looked at him for a second and remembered he didnt have a lot of exposure to syndar culture the ignorant bastard i thought im half syndar marcus im considered impure broken a bastard compared to full syndar some of them wouldnt spit on me if i was on fire its pretty bad marcus took another drink looking down at the ground that sucks shit brodin i didnt know but dont you have any family or friends left in the world he asked as he handed me the flask i took a good long drink its probably better if i started from the beginning i was born in 218 on faedrun in the maykar desert to the syndar phoenix enclave my mother was a syndar silversmith named carmella my father was a human candle maker named brosk my mother was originally from the enclave and she showed talent in the working of silver by the time she was in her 80s her craft had made her pretty well known and liked my father was a traveling candle maker always traveling and illuminating the world as he once told me i smiled remembering those times so long ago he stopped at the enclave to resupply his stock and hopefully to make a little profit he told me that he had no intentions of settling down but then he met my mother she was not one to give up on things that she wanted she knew what kind of scandal it would cause but they didnt care both my mother and father provided a service that people needed so as long as they didnt advertise it too much no one openly denounced them i came along three years later at the time my name was brodin wic they agreed that my first name should be syndar and that i should be given a second name of a sign of respect for my father my second name changed when i was showing signs of magic when i was 8 certain things happened i was helping my father make a batch of candles i became focused on something and suddenly a lot of the candles just exploded or melted everywhere after that incident my mother suggested that my second name needed to be altered to represent who i would becometherefore my second name was changed to fizzlewic my childhood was excellent memorable and fun the enclave treated me as one its own and i enjoyed playing with the few other syndar children i was very curious a bit naive and very gullible as i grew older i tended to listen more speak when it was necessary and tell people the truth even if they didnt want to hear it that goes for insulting them too if they were acting like it mother said that it was a very human trait after the candle incident my mother took me under her wing to learn silver metal crafting along with silver crafting i was sent to the magus to receive training as a mage becoming a silversmith and training to be a mage was busy but it kept me out of trouble life was good in the phoenix enclave it changed when the magus yara went on her journey of enlightenment when she returned it was not with good news magus yara told of her journey into the desert and how solar spoke to her the sun god spoke of the undead and that they would envelop faedrun and bring an era of evil and degradation to the continent solar told her that they could find a new home across the great sea this news was not received very well because it brought more questions than answers and a lot of arguments in the enclave my mother knew the magus for a long time and she looked worried we left with magus yara immediately after she told of her vision of solar i was leaving the only real home that i had ever known with most of the enclave in year 232 i was 13 summers old at the time my parents bought three dusty camels for the journey one for each of us to ride on and to carry our few valuables everything else my parents sold to those who insisted on staying i was excited to go on an adventure to see new lands and journey where very few of our enclave had been our caravan was a decent size when we left our home at the first oasis we stopped at to replenish our water supply we ran into another caravan they looked very road worn and didnt have a much in terms of supplies they spoke of horror stories to the magus and elders communicating rumors of undead we traveled for a week after that before we came upon a band of armed men they had a very grimy look many of them were armored in various degrees of cloth leather armor and patches of chainmail this was my first encounter with bandits many of our caravan were unarmed and didnt know how to defend themselves there were a few however including my father who knew their way around a blade or could cast spells it was in that battle that i used my first push spell to dismount an armored man into a group of camels an irritable camel named birtha started stepping on the bandit until he stopped moving we fought off the bandits but many of our men and women died in the fray the main force of the thieves were pushed back until they broke and fled that night many of our people were exhausted beyond belief i am not sure if the sentry fell asleep or was knocked unconscious but a few stealthy bandits returned to take what they could with the cover of night my father was awakened to a bandit rooting through my mothers silver things the other man got the upper hand and slit my fathers throat before he could call for help my mother woke up from the struggle and screamed as my father was killed the bandit turned and ran but fell over a sack of things he intended to steal my mother then took my fathers sword and buried it in the bandits skull three other bandits were found and instantly killed my fathers death hit the both of us really hard my mother decided it was best to bury it with continuing my training as a silversmith i asked raina a magus in training to teach me battle spells to punish those bandits lurking in the shadows she looked at me and gave me a sympathetic look and told me vengeance is not what we seek but to survive the coming storm that will swallow this land forgive me little one you are still too young to receive such training i will however teach you how to protect those who cannot protect themselves it took many months to reach the sea dealing with bandits and bribing border guards became the norm our caravan used many of its valuables to procure mercenaries that would protect our people eventually the loss of my father just became a dull ache i worked closely with my mother to keep her safe and to learn what i could we both found the loss easier to deal with if we were busy my rage had subsided to wonder again as we reached the sea in aldoria for most of us it was our first time seeing the seemingly endless blue expanse i stood in awe at the sight of it by this time many of the ship captains were not interested in leaving port to cross the vast sea but before too long we found two ships big enough to take all of us in the direction that we wanted the enclave sold most if not all of its belongings including the camels my mother was no exception though she did keep her silversmith tools many of which i still use today we left a week later and many of our caravan were trained to be passable sailors i went to work as a cabin boy and kitchen aid it was grueling work to maintain the captains ship while working with the human sailors i picked up many mannerisms and dialects i also found out what it means to curse like a sailor some of the things that were said made my mother blush it was nice to see her smile again for a bit i lost her a month later it started with the storms that knocked us off course and then we slowly ran low on supplies the ship was fairly cramped with people and provisions were scarce disease was starting to become common my mother got sick when she was trying to cure many of the ill always trying to help others rather than herself i was decimated i had lost my parents and most of the people i knew to this journey i spent the next couple of days below deck holding onto my mothers tools depressed and crying my eyes out it was not fair that i was alone some of the enclave huddled around me when i didnt realize it and spent the nights through my trauma holding me close i woke on the third day with no tears left to cry then i looked at all those that remained and saw that we all had lost someone dear to us i didnt have a family anymore but i had my people i may not be a full syndar but we all bled and cried on this journey we were family then i knew that i had a home no matter where i went weeks later raina spotted land it was a deserted island which would become our new home we spent the next few months establishing a settlement and working hard to repair the ships that brought us here the journey from the desert in 232 to the island in 238 had been a six year journey 25 years later i had a home built in a strong oak tree and had a silversmith shop built at the base i was now a silversmith and a magus in training which kept my mind pretty busy yet i still wanted something more i wanted to help people and hopefully make a difference i sold many of my wares to everyone on the island so i had a decent reputation and was well liked i was visiting lady anariel to get the specifics on an earring commission when she got news that a couple of her mage friends had taken ill she was scheduled to leave in the morning for the mainland to attend a political dinner as a delegate from the fire isle she couldnt summon anyone with the short time that she had so she asked if i would accompany her to the dinner i eagerly accepted and ran home to pack a few things i was going on another adventure and i couldnt wait to get moving upon reaching the mainland we gathered our little procession and moved out lady anariel stopped me before we got too far out of port and asked me if i could gather some reagents from the surrounding landscape she wished to know if they could be used to enhance the flavor and special effects of her pickles always the one to please and looking to explore as much as i could of this new place i accepted finishing with my task i hurried to catch up with my caravan that is when i ran into bandits and you marcus thank you again for helping me out with them marcus looked at me with a smile on his face and a glimmer in his eye he was drunk any time brodin like i said i like to think that anyone would have done the same we both bled a lot these last couple months and i am sure that we will bleed more this world is messed up and we are trying to fix it but i will tell you what there isnt anyone that i would have by my side but you brother he said as he patted me on the back a single tear rolled from my eye which was lost in the rain i have a brother my mind screamed my chest filled with joy that warmed my whole body i recast my mage fire with renewed effort i looked off to the east and saw the sky start to grey as a new day approached marcus saw me turn and looked himself hey shitheads open up this rotten gate stand by we are opening the gate called a voice from the up in the gatehouse about fucking time i heard marcus grumble i also heard the large timber moving away from the lock as the door slid open as the door opened a man with a thick cape and sword walked through i am sergeant olsen what business do you have here he said with authority gunny is that you gunny olsen put that pig sticker away and let me in im so cold my balls are saying dirty things to my liver marcus said his voice dripping with sarcasm marcus what the hell are you doing outside its good to see you the sergeant said turning to the gate say sergeant are your men supposed to keep people outside all night in the rain i asked dryly no the corporal on duty derget i think his name is should have let you in there are 5 archers and bolters on this wall alone you would have been a pincushion if you tried anything funny he said as he let us inside the gate and which one is corporal derget marcus said neutrally sergeant olsen pointed to a blearyeyed man that had just come out of the guard tower and was making his way up the street when he was about to pass us not aware that we even existed marcus turned swiftly to grab the corporals tunic and punched him solidly with his left hand dergets feet left the ground as he landed in the mud and didnt move thats what you fucking get for leaving us out all fucking night you son of a whore marcus screamed at the unconscious man the rest of the guards all drew steel and readied bows stand down gunny commanded richards he pointed to a youth up on the wall with a bow is what marcus said true did corporal derget leave them outside all night while he slept in the tower the youth looked left and right yes sergeant he did he said that they can all rot for waking him up he also said that if we opened our mouths we would be on night duty for the next month others nodded their heads confirming what richards stated obviously this derget wasnt much liked gunny looked down at derget and spat on him jenkins and gotter take corporal derget to the brig i will get to him this afternoon turning to marcus and me he said i would like to offer apologies for the newhope city guards negligence im sure corporal derget has learned his lesson and he is willing to pay for a room so that you may dry your clothes and get a warm meal marcus looked at me and winked that sounds good gunny i will stop by after your duty is done for the day lets go brodin some breakfast and hopefully a bed with a warm lady is in my future i followed him for a few muddy sodden streets into a small square where i saw a few cloaked merchants preparing their covered stalls i recognized one of the merchants as myra silvertongue a half syndar like myself who lived and worked in newhope as a tailor i currently wore the tunic she gave me the last time i saw her road worn and sodden but still in one piece turning to marcus my friend this one has business with a certain seamstress and will see you later he glanced over my shoulder to myra and his face split into a toothy grin i will see you later buddy patting me on the shoulder he turned and walked deeper into the city i turned and walked up to myra suddenly warm siala kay nu myra do you remember this one she turned to me and gave me a little sly smile siala kay nu brodin this one does remember you and is wondering what took you so long to return this one has noticed your tunic has seen better days she looked up at the slate grey sky as the rain continued its relentless assault on newhope with no signs of letting up this one also thinks that this is not a good day to sell much this one would be happy to dry and repair your tunic if you would regale me of your travels again she shocked me with her forwardness but i was very cold wet and very hungry marcus brew also wearing off i gave her a slight bow and deciding to solar with formality i would like that very much she smiled more as she gathered her large duffel sack full of wares follow me my sodden hero my heart started racing as i felt warm again i followed her for a few steps and asked if i could carry her heavy pack she looked at me for a moment before accepting i shouldered the heavy sack and took her hand in my free hand her warm hand felt delicate yet strong in my cold callused hands she did not recoil from the coldness and grittiness of my hand she instead gripped tighter her warmth slowly spreading to me it made me feel safer than i had felt in a long time read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1227brodinsbackstoryixzz48lnwrxpbthe first light of dawn is filtering through drawn curtains the rays fall through air thick with incense before landing on the foot of a bed the light illuminates the room just enough to make out dark shapes against the lightly painted brick walls a bed takes up the center of the room with its head against the wall and a large trunk at its foot a desk cluttered with colorful bottles of various shapes and sizes sits on one side of the bed next to the window on the opposite side of the bed there sits an armor stand dressed with mismatched leather pieces and a small weapons rack holding a staff and a singleedged sword on the bed the pile of blankets stirs and one of the lumps moves to the foot of the bed seemingly searching for the morning the chambers door creaks open to the large trunk at the foot of the bed a hooded and cloaked figure moves quietly over the threshold stepping lightly across the wood floor and makes its way towards the far side of the bed a black and brown snout appears from under the blankets at the foot of the bed followed by the dark face of a dog with perked ears and brown eyes watching the figure moving through the room a groggy female voice emerges from the pile of blankets wylder go back to sleep when the figure holds up a finger to where its lips should be wylder rests his head on the bed and allows one ear to flop down the figure reaches the head of the bed and leans over the bed bringing its hooded head just inches from a knot of blonde hair flowing out from under the blankets the figure whispers to the bed come on sapphira wake up with a groan sapphira snaps back its too damn early faolan in response faolan heads to the window and pulls back the curtains allowing the full blinding agony of the morning light into their bedroom by this point the sun has risen so that the direct beams of light now land on the head of the bed without the curtains providing the first line of defense against the morning light sapphira retreats further under the blankets but with the continued rising of the sun comes the further strengthening of the rays within moments sapphira concedes that the blankets are no longer enough to stop the morning from coming in somewhat of a tantrum sapphira throws the blankets off of herself revealing her pure white nightgown and moves to get out of bed as her feet touch the wooden floor she looks up and sees faolan rummaging through the bottles on her desk faolan what are you looking for the components for todays ritual todays ritual wait its today yeah i watched the twins rise last night from the observatory and the sun rose over the vernal peaks this morning with that sapphira jumps to her feet and moves to her desk pushing faolan out of the way without a moments hesitation she purposefully grabs one of the colored glass bottles hands it to faolan and tells him these are what we need from up here ill have to get the rest after i get dressed faolan takes the bottle from sapphira and turns to head for the door hey take wylder with you too alright wylder come here boy lets go wylder jumps off the bed pauses to stretch then trots to the door ahead of faolan and make sure you find a field that hasnt been planted yet yeah i know sapphira wylder then leads faolan out the door sapphira can hear the echo of their descent down the staircase for several moments while she gets dressed for this day as faolan and wylder walk through the dusty streets towards the hot springs at the center of town they can hear the rest of the settlement coming to life for another day of activity at the hot springs faolan sits on one of the benches and looks through the steam coming off the water later tonight these springs will be a bustle with people washing off the dirt from the fields and soaking away the aches of the day now faolan and wylder wait for the workers to gather before heading out after several moments most of the workers have gathered in the town faolan steps through the crowd leaving wylder sitting next to the bench looking for three individuals the ulven priestess rosil manaweaver the human gerald manaweaver who seems to be a natural leader and has taken a role on the town council and the syndar magis zyga mae he finds all three of them at the head of the road leading out of town apart from the main crowd talking together over the plans for the day faolan hangs backs just on the edge of the crowd listening to their conversation picking up small details of their plans and waiting for a break in their discussion before inserting himself he sees the window he is looking for just as they are about to finalize their plans and so steps from the crowd into their group rosil is the first to greet him good day faolan good day rosil faolan and zyga exchange slight nods gerald offers his hand are you coming out to help again today in a way sapphira has a ritual that needs to be performed this noon an offering for a good growing season interested rosil asks what do you need from us not too much really it sounded like you wont be to the upper fields until this afternoon i would just ask that you make sure one of those fields are left until sapphira has finished i would expect her ritual to be complete by the early afternoon so i hope this would not interfere with todays schedule too much rosil replies for an offering to gaia it is no trouble at all gerald also chimes in if nothing else we can just have a longer break for lunch zyga also approved i do not foresee any problem with this thank you all faolan offers his hand to gerald and bows to rosil and zyga as he steps back into the crowd he calls for wylder and then turns to head out towards the fields as he does gerald sets to work directing the crowd into their teams and explains whats in store for each faolan reaches the edge of the settlement just as wylder catches up to him together they journey down the road to find a place that sapphira would find perfect a little after midmorning faolan has finally found a field perfect for sapphiras ritual today its about an acre in size and almost square with the eastwest slightly longer than the northsouth the air is crisp and smells a bit of rain song birds grace the world with their chorus the tree tops sway in a soft breeze with wylder chasing field mice up and down the rows of dirt faolan is just finishing lashing together an altar made of the winters dead fall from the surrounding tree line faolan carries the finished altar to the center of the field just as sapphira steps through the tree line onto the field you could have sent wylder to show me where you were setting up at instead i had to ask a half dozen people where you were before i found someone who knew for sure sapphira walks towards the altar its good that you are talking to more people these are our people now our clan with a huff sapphira drops her knapsack next to their altar wylder runs over to her excitedly and jumps on her to greet her licking her hands and trying to lick her face she sets him back down onto all fours and kneels down to his level to tell him hello wylder shoves his nose into sapphiras bag looking unsuccessfully for any treats she might have brought for him sapphira pulls his nose out of her bag so that she can retrieve the items she will need faolan kneels down to hold wylder back from sapphiras bag from her bag sapphira pulls a pale green cloth with blue and purple ribbon and places it on their altar faolan calls wylder to sit then he begins to unfold the cloth and uncovers three eggs safely hidden within he drapes the cloth over their altar then sets each egg on the cloth in a nest of colored ribbon so that they create a triangle pointing south sapphira turns back to her bag and pulls out a bundle each of forsythia lilacs lilies and herbs she arranges the herbs around each nest and the flowers in between sapphira returns back to her bag one last time and retrieves a wooden chalice she turns to faolan where is that bottle i gave you this morning faolan fetches the bottle from his belt pouch and hands it to sapphira sapphira pulls the cork stopper from the bottle with her mouth and pours the contents into the chalice a viscous golden liquid flows slowly from the bottle and the faint scent of honey floats on the air once the bottle is empty she replaces the cork back in the bottle and hands the bottle back to faolan sapphira then fetches a bottle about twice as big from her belt pouch removes its stopper and pours its contents into the chalice the liquid from this bottle is white in color and flows like water once that bottle is empty she replaces the cork and hands the bottle to faolan to store in his belt pouch with the other bottle next sapphira retrieves a wooden spoon from her belt pouch and begins stirring what are now the contents of the chalice together once the contents are thoroughly mixed she hands the chalice to faolan he quietly mutters makeaoshu and the chalice begins to glow with a faint blue hue faolan then hands the chalice back to sapphira and she moves to the south side of their altar as he sits on the north side to meditate wylder lays down just next to faolan and peers under the altar to keep a watchful eye on sapphira sapphira takes five steps away from their altar and pours a portion of chalice contents on to the ground after she is done pouring she recites her first prayer i make this offering to gaia as thanks for the many blessings i have received and those i shall someday receive sapphira then turns and walks counterclockwise around their altar she takes slow deliberate steps making sure to stay five paces from their altar a quarter of the way around her circle she stops pours a bit more from the chalice and recites her second prayer the wheel of the year turns once more and omeria arrives sol and luna are equals and the soil begins to change gaia awakes from her slumber new life springs forth once more sapphira continues along her path stopping after she has traversed another quarter of the circle a thought invades faolans meditation  gaia is waking from her slumber the world around us is coming back from the death of winter death is just another slumber it is a natural thing to wake from that slumber  sapphira pours yet more from the chalice and recites her third prayer sol draws ever closer to us greeting gaia with his welcoming rays luna and sol are equals and the sky fills with light and warmth sol warms the land beneath our feet sapphira continues along her path again stopping after she has traversed yet another quarter of the circle she pours a little more from the chalice and recites her fourth prayer spring has come for this we are thankful the divine is present all around in the cool fall of a rain storm in the tiny buds of a flower in the down of a newborn chick in the fertile fields waiting to be planted in the sky above us and in the earth below us we thank the universe for all it has to offer us and are so blessed to be alive on this day welcome life welcome light welcome spring sapphira completes her path around their altar she stops where she recited her first prayer she pours out the rest of the contents of the chalice while repeating her first prayer i make this offering to gaia as thanks for the many blessings i have received and those i shall someday receive with that the energy that faolan put into the chalice is gone and sapphira then returns to their altar and begins returning items to her pack faolan disassembles the altar gathers up the pieces and walks to the north edge of the field he walks clockwise around the field placing a piece of the altar evenly around the field so the pieces encompass the perimeter of the field he reaches the road where sapphira and wylder are waiting for him together they walk back towards the spire with wylder leading the way watching him run back and forth from one side of the road to the other sniffing and looking for some unknown read more httplasthopelarpproboardscomthread1138storyjimmybeckytylerixzz3qodyisk2vazra took a moment to enjoy the warmth of the hot spring before continuing his lecture he found the warm water and proximity to nature far preferable to the cold confines of a classroom he reclined against a rock and savored the contrast against the cool air just above the surface he took a deep breath and began see mage armor is an extremely volatile aura of arcane protection ordinarily any attempt to add a second layer will result in the premature activation of the first canceling both out essentially mage armor as we once knew it would react to other mage armor ultimately we found no amount of tampering with the frequency would bypass this issue instead we found a solution when we created an entirely second spell mimicking the first in practice but fundamentally different in theory he took a moment to make sure his students were still with him some of the ulven particularly the males split their time between remarkable dedication to their training and denouncing the practice of magic entirely right so improved mage armor as its commonly known is actually a contingent enchantment it doesnt do anything until an outside action triggers it this way the spell doesnt interfere with the protective aura of the traditional mage armor instead it sleeps until exposed to a significant source of energy physical or magical at which time the spell freezes the caster in stasis for the imperceptibly short moment of impact a young syndar girl who had previously gone unnoticed raised her hand inquisitively so it stops time that would be a gross overstatement vazra replied confused to her sudden presence relax youre overthinking things some of the other students gave him strange looks while to his annoyance the young syndar girl raised her hand again this time vazra noticed a gruesome gash across her arm yes he replied so startled by the sight of the wound that he failed to acknowledge it at all her tone turned dark and she looked to him accusingly why did you let us die she hissed vazra froze the feeling of guilt crawling through his gut as he looked on in horror blood began to trickle from the girls eyes like red tears he tried to stutter out an apology but couldnt find the words the world began to spin as he watched horrific apparitions of the dead appear and sink vicious claws into her cheeks and gut they mutilated the girl tearing her apart piece by piece in a panic he scrambled out of the spring and shut his eyes cowering before the horror archmage a voice snapped him back to reality looking back to the pool he found that the girl creatures and gore were gone leaving only the faces of confused students behind they exchanged awkward expressions for a long time before at last the silence was broken lets umm move on to another subject vazra cleared his throat trying to escape the situation while at the most basic and fundamental level there is no difference between arcane and divine magic a distinction is drawn based on preconceptions and variations between practices he continued regaining his confidence as the students eased back into the lesson i can guide you down your own path of discovery but ultimately each and every one of you will need to discover your own individual practices of spell casting these defer between cultures and people because mana tends to behave differently depending on your relationship to it you must accommodate these variations and discover in what manner you are personally connected to the mana stream meditate carefully and observe with which methods mana proves most malleable and then synchronize yourself accordingly these fluctuations have drastic practical implications for example under ordinary circumstances a syndar cannot become a so called witchmage this is because their spirits are more inclined to attune themselves to a particular practice this doesnt mean they are less capable mages by any means quite the contrary it would be more accurate to say it is within their nature to specialize they personify these distinctions as the influences of their deities luna and sol speaking of which many of you also personify the mana stream or its source in your own way none of you are necessarily wrong and i am in no way commenting on the legitimacy of those beliefs but instead wish to impart an openminded approach to magic and the realization that the practices of other cultures have much to offer your own studies these lessons will apply across the board regardless of your tradition with that addressed let us return to some of the practical implications apart from the arcanedivine distinction some of you will be able to draw mana faster than others through meditation and some of you will have massive reserves but will be slow to replenish them it is helpful to imagine mana as a body of water while considering this some of you will be like white water emptying into a shallow pond others like great and old lakes fed by the narrow mouth of a slow river the water metaphor can also be applied to the various states of mana and how different individuals excel at shaping it in different ways some of you will be best suited to sculpt ice others to dig canals or to pack snow others still are snowless snow is a lot of fun and those without it tend to be rather depressed we call those sticks in the mud hallowed and tend not to invite them to parties beginning to digress and growing tired of lecturing vazra then took his students through a long series of breathing exercises letting them slowly drift into deep meditation once their attention was refocused he slipped away unnoticed or so he thought archmage a curious human student by the name of maxwell had pursued him from the pool you havent elaborated at all on your own methods ha vazra laughed turning back so you want to take after the best at my core i accept the truths ive shared every preconceived limitation is simply a mental construct born of ignorance mastery of magic comes from spiritual growth physical training and relentless practice above all however it comes from the imagination the imagination maxwell laughed yes imagination vazra scolded when you truly accept the possibilities as limitless that is what they will become behold vazra knelt and chanted an incantation circling his left hand over his right within his palm crackled yellow energy piercing bolt the archmage smiled ive never seen that spell before maxwell commented and it did nothing to save us the syndar girl added accusingly few have vazra replied trying his best to ignore the girl and shake off the hallucination what good did your tricks do when the dead rose from their graves when they killed us in front of you she spat the world began to spin and close in around vazra he felt as if he was suffocating like every breath was being stolen from him increasingly uncomfortable he motioned for his student to join him as he fled the womans scorn a long time they walked and for a while nothing was said vazra just looked back and forth nervously jumping at shadows and muttering nonsensical apologies eventually however the anxiety passed and he gained the nerve to continue as if nothing had happened what we call piercing bolt proves far too volatile to practically employ but serves to demonstrate a point that the spells you commonly encounter are the constructs of casters who gravitate towards a tried and true selection rather than the limitations of magic itself the energy called mana can be manipulated innumerable ways once you understand its nature i have also dabbled in a spell containing the personified essence of muffins in fact i once attempted to call lightning down from the heavens to strike my opponent dead i mean it didnt work but the point remains and i have some sexy scars to show off as a result woman love scars thats another important point archmage the student asked confused by the sudden change of topic hush maxwell youre a man now you need to hear this see you have to be confident but not arrogant or narcissistic sensitive caring but also independent nobody likes a yesman you should always strive for selfimprovement but above all you need to be yourself nobody likes a fraud or wants to be loved for somebody theyre not archmage ermm arent we getting off subject what about the magic love is magic youth today you have no appreciation for the romantic once back in faedrun i witnessed a conflicted penitent cultist offer a vandregonian woman a mushroom as a token of affection as much as i loathe the penitent i have to admit it was a clever twist see he took a romantic clich and made it personal and unique at that moment vazra abruptly lost interest in any further conversation without a word he departed back to the spire once again leaving behind a student scratching his head in confusionaccount of volrok battleborn hinrich  first week of march 264  day of departure it was a bitter wind that blew through crows landing that early morning it passed through the cracks and crevices of any building it crossed volroks small and humble home was no exception the wind went right on through the floor boards and up to his mound of furs and blankets he shivered as the bitter wind rushed between the bundles of dead animal pelts and fabric another day in paradise how grand volrok grumbled as he slowly stirred from his slumber the night before he was busy looking at drawings and reading letters and he didnt go to sleep till late in the night being awoken by such a cold and bitter air didnt make the start of this day seem too grand after he got dressed he went through his usual ritual oiling and polishing armor sharpening and oiling weapons and finally having breakfast it almost always consisted of stew or soup from the night before with stale bread it was a meager meal for a ioclaochra but being the last of his company at least for the moment funds were tight and anything else that wasnt needed for survival would be considered a luxury he quickly finished the stale bread and three day old rabbit stew hoping to be done with it for the taste was like eating a wellworn leather boot but with less taste once done with the food he moved on to the front door and put his own boots on and left the small dreary estate the sun was just beginning to crown the horizon the deathly cold wind only confirmed that the days of spring should be approaching soon soon he was at the lumber mill a place where he has been frequently as of late since making the sponsorship contract with the rangers volrok has been hastily preparing for rebuilding the broken blade spending most of his time writing to old friends and allies to find if any of them would honor old promises and give favors towards the rebuilding of the company sadly most of the contacts could not promise to help rebuild anytime soon except say a few people offering aid if he ever stopped by but today would be different for today was going to change volroks world a single letter from an old friend in a merchant caravan is going to turn volroks world completely upside down to my dear friend volrok hinrich it has been over five years since you last wrote to me even then it was all business which only reminds me of how much you take after your grandfather however since it is still somewhat winter and my funds are beginning to run low i will not be able to help you financially or with supplies to rebuild come this summer though if you are ever near davens reach i will gladly hire you on as a guard for our caravans once again i will even do better than that if i get this deal to go through i will come into a surplus of iron ore once i get it refined i will personally purchase you a wagon full of armaments for the company to use there is other news dreary news or good news for you on a recent trip down to the colony of newhope i came upon the place where the ambush occurred all those years ago at this time though the air was warm and the sun melted away snow and ice i found something from all those years ago small trail littered with armor shards now i did not venture too far into the woods out of fear of being attacked but i marked the location on the trail with the symbol of ulfkell i suggest you move fast good friend who knows when the next snow will hide the trail ignite the fires far old friend grench londt volrok trembled as he read the letter his hands shook violently in both joy and anger like a bolt of lightning he flew from the lumber mill to his house he didnt hesitate he could not hesitate for what was hinted in that letter was that there may be remains of his fallen brothers and sisters maybe even his fathers by noon volrok had left without leaving a note on his door the small abode dark and quiet not even mice or birds landed there if anybody was to peer inside all they would see is a humble home locked up tight and waiting for the return of the only remaining member of the family it once housed day 15 volrok was lucky that he was able to join a small caravan heading north west towards davens reach when he was leaving thankfully they will be resupplying inside the gates for sometime giving volrok time to travel alone towards his destination when he arrived near the edges of the old site the battlefather only saw it natural to make the event that much more difficult by adding a snow storm thankfully it was still daylight and he could make out the symbol and the outline of the travel that was marked he kneeled before the symbol and whispered is today the day that i finally can rest my brothers and sisters in your flames is it finally time for them to be at rest it didnt take volrok long to maneuver through the small trail his raid on the white oaks his constant patrols with the rangers honed his legs and feet to maneuver such terrain he walked and walked the snow only came down harder making it all that much more difficult to see the wind howled like wolves after a stag the snow and sleet stung his face this will not stop me not now or never he said to himself trying to calm a slowly rising rage at the nearly impossible task before him now the snow was now knee deep but he felt it he was close close to what he sought for so many long years it was dark now the only source of light he had was a lantern that was barely staying lit finally he spotted something that didnt belong well it did but was not expected it was a bluff with a small cave he looked around making sure that no mordok were following him and quickly dove into the cave it was blocked blocked by a massive metal shield volrok grunted and groaned as his frozen fingers dug the snow out of the way so that he could open the entrance he wrapped his fingers around the edge and gave a great tug dust took to the wind and fresh air seeped into the once sealed cave quickly volrok drug his gear and himself inside the hole and sealed it up once more ack he barked as he turned around and came face to face with a skull he had instinctively drew his dagger and was ready to fight but the mass of bones didnt move apparently it was truly dead he sighed as he sheathed his fathers blade and relaxed leaning against the wall of the cave after letting his heart calm he looked around more carefully with the lantern he found them he found three of the members from his company at least what was left of them the next day volrok awoke slowly cold but not numb like he was the night before quietly he moved towards the shield that sealed his temporary home and peered out of the cave not a soul cursed or otherwise he sighed in relief as he felt the now warm sun baring down on air melting the snow he had to move quickly for he didnt have much time he began to look over the skeletons and tried to identify them by what they had on them the first one he identified the one that he nearly tried to kill last night was delgal the wall brocha the man was as he sounded massive in stature and was able to hold his ground against five foes at once for some time volrok thought back thought back to the days that delgal would train him in the ways of using a shield he was like an older brother laughing with him when he made a mistake and often covered for him when his father torcoll would get angry for the lack of training before volrok was the very shield that delgal used in every battle in every duel in every aspect of his life setting the shield aside he began to bundle the bones together into a nice pile for carrying the next skeleton was thin but had a distinctive scar on the skull meaning it could only be one person siv blood dancer simmershade siv may have been a syndar but she was by far the closest thing he had to a mother figure she was stern reserved and usually very serious and showed little to no interest in anything however when alone with volrok as boy she had a different face siv was quiet in voice and very kind when she taught him how to read and write when he received his hat she pulled him aside after the celebration and gave him a warm hug and a gift her personal hunting knife she received from her own father when she was a child volrok felt something beginning to move in him he has not felt it for some time he shook his head and moved on piling her bones into the carrying bundle the last one was not his father the hat wasnt fancy enough nor did it really have a hat but in its hand was a finely made bow fractured in multiple places made of an old iron king tree back from richtcrag this was calmire deadshot balone one of the finest bowmen that volrok had ever known who supposedly hailed from olon zylj slowly the fog of time brought him back to one of the few memories he had of this mysterious man for most of his life volroks interactions with calmire had been somewhat limited for the man would usually only associate with his brother however this wasnt the case one day in valinate for you see volrok was only about ten years old and was usually following siv or delgal around learning the ways of being an oclaochra but that day was different volrok felt compelled to follow the mysterious calmire that day quietly volrok followed in the shadows watching him maneuver through the alleys and streets as if they were his backyard at one point calmire came to a rather dark and foreboding alley however he pressed on out of the shadows of the building came five men armed with maces clubs and swords and surrounded him give us your weapons and money one of the thugs demanded calmire only sighed and gave them a glare as cold as any death knight could give off leave and you might survive calmire warned them the thing with thugs however is that they generally are not too bright this bunch was a fine example of the stereotype one brute attacked from behind and in a flash his life came to a halt since a dagger in the skull tends to do that calmire twirled around the now dead man grabbed the sword from his hand and began to defend himself slicing a hamstring here piercing a lung there calmire was fighting far better than what volrok was lead to believe the reason for that is due to calmire never fighting on the front lines always using his bow and commanding the archers in the rear in a flash the skirmish was over and in the center stood calmire his face just as serious as it was before the event occurred its not nice to follow others volrok he stated calming looking towards the corner of the alley where volrok was peeking around from youre not from olon zylj are you volrok boldly asked knowing the answer calmire only turned and walked away from volrok youre from here arent you it shows in how you fight why do before volrok could finish calmire shot him a glare to be quiet dont say anything to the others they dont need to know he whispered to volrok shyly he backed off and followed behind calmire its because you like being with us right volrok inquired one last time all he got for a reply was a smile volrok came back from memories and felt the wind blow into the cave from the cracked shield he quietly stacked the bones of calmire into the bundle being careful to take the bow the swords and the single massive shield into his gear with the bundle slowly he got up and left the cave double checking to see if there was anything left in their packs finding only a single journal he quickly put it in his pack and began his trek back to davens reach bandits had taken over the reach but if you had coin purpose or looked like enough trouble they generally left you alone if they didnt leave him alone volrok was certain he could become enough trouble he didnt plan on staying anyway now that he had found what he came searching for his intent was to return home to crows landing quickly day 30 he finally reached the entrance of crows landing and as he reached the gate he leaned against it a few spare coin and a good song during some drink let him pass through davens reach without too much trouble but volrok was exhausted from this venture emotionally and physically he knocked on the gate as hard as he could in hopes that someone would open the gates who goes there came a voice from the watchtower volrok battleborn hinrich currently under the employ of the rangers of crows landing i wish to return to my own bed he stated loudly showing his shoulder drape in a few minutes the gates opened and he made his way to his home towards the far end of the city once there he opened the door and sat down on the single chair in the house he carefully began to unpack the bundle of bones from the rest of the pack making sure not to drop any of the bones after doing this volrok instantly headed to the blacksmith carrying the bundle once there he knocked on the door to the forge hoping that the local blacksmith was still awake what do you want im closed said a gruff richtcraig voice from behind the door volrok steadied himself and replied i need to use the forge its for religious purposes the door cracked open and a single eye peered out at him it looked up and down and then down at the bundle the door then closed quickly followed by rattling of chains come in brother said the weathered blacksmith volrok didnt hesitate he moved into the forge and placed the bundle of bones on the anvil and began to pray it was a long and quiet prayer which is rare for those that follow ulfkell while volrok prayed the blacksmith placed a vented cast iron pan above the coals and another pan underneath it to catch the ashes as soon as volrok was done praying the bundle of bones was placed on the vented pan and the flames began their job slowly the bones began to catch flame and turn into ashes all the while volrok watched silently the blacksmith turned to look at volrok and was going to comment but didnt he instead he left the room leaving the oclaochra to mourn volrok stood there watching the flames turn the remains to ash the only sound that may have been heard other than the fire would have been the nearly silent sobs of a warrior that had lost practically everythingthe storm the story of marcus clearbrook written by michael tukiendorf fritha stormjarl looked outside at the bellowing wind and snow making visibility almost impossible past 15 yards she glanced out the window to barely see inside the stable where a stable hand brushed down their foultempered pack pony she and a couple of warriors have been tasked with commissioning supplies from the new hope granary while stanrick longfang was at the political dinner in new hope she should be there but her people must get fed and their health is her priority food has been hard to come by as of late with the hard winter and new hope couldnt spare much from their stores so she and her pack went to new aldoria to see if they could barter for some she was able to obtain the supplies they needed but at an exorbitant price this winter will be harsh for everyone and this blizzard will not help matters they would have liked to make it back to new hope by this evening but the blizzard forced them to take cover in this lonely inn tucked behind a small hill about 250 yards from the main road was the hidden gem inn while not large compared to the inns at new ardoria and new hope it did boast four modestly furnished rooms and a tap room able to house one score patrons the large size fireplace was blazing giving the room a very warm and comfortable feeling the hard hickory logs being burned gave the room a pleasant nutty aroma looking around the inn fritha imagined on any given day the inn would normally be busy with local farmers tonight the inn is empty except for the innkeeper his wife and two sons and her band most likely the locals have declined the treacherous trek through the blizzard to enjoy watered down mead and thin soup but beggars cant be choosers and this blizzard makes us all beggars her warriors are all stowing their gear in the two rooms soon they will be down for an evening meal then to bed for the amount of snow and wind they will be digging the inn out before they leave in the morning the door opens behind the bar revealing the portly innkeeper carrying a large stack of firewood oak this time need a hand innkeeper fritha asked nay i have it blast this weather has my back all in knots but i am glad to you and your group for offering to help us dig out in the morning otherwise i would be bed ridden for a month and my wife bless her heart is not able to run the inn without me he said as he put the oak logs into the now full wood box dinner will be ready shortly since your lot is helping us out i asked my wife to whip up a large venison roast from a deer my son arrowed two days previous the innkeeper said with a smile well you have our thanks for taking us in on such short notice fritha said with a slight bow of her head it is no trouble i assure you it would be devilish of us to deny honored ulven folk shelter from the elements especially since you open your arms to help us out in our time of need now i need to make sure that my son jennson has the all the rooms ready for you and your men fritha watched as he retreated to the back of the inn she resumed her gaze out one of the four windows looking at the torrent of snow swirling and dancing in the wind the stables have been locked down and the innkeepers other son was making his way to the back of the inn the kitchen she assumes and their living quarters looking to the road that brought them to this inn it was mostly covered and drifted over with at least five hands of snow in spots tomorrow is going to be a chore she thought absently getting bored of looking outside and anticipating the hard work in the morning fritha started turning away when glimmer faint caught her peripheral vision looking back out down the disappearing road she didnt see anything holding her breath she counted in her head there it was again faint but definitely there exhaling and inhaling slowly she searched for the mysterious light a swirl of snow and blinking of light showed two men struggling to break through snow drifts and make their way to the inn another swirl of snow and they were gone in fury of the blizzard erik bjorn to me she yelled she made her way to the front door she heard stomping from the floor above confirming that her cohorts where on their way she waited five breaths before she tore open the door and was greeted with piercing winds and chilled temperatures a stole her breath ignoring her discomfort she waded through the snow and fought the bludgeoning wind toward where she saw the distraught travelers or so she thought the wind ripped at her exposed hands and face threatening to tear off her skin to steal her still warm insides the cold froze her lungs making it very hard to breath the dying light making it very hard to see anything hearing the struggling grunts from behind her confirmed that her companions where close behind her seeing nothing but snow and wind fritha stopped held her breath and counted again her eyes scanning everything for any sign she was about to give up at nine when she saw a brief flicker three yards away under a thin layer of snow there she yelled pointing at a mound of snow that looking indistinguishable from any other mound bounding over the snow drifts fritha reached the spot where she last saw the light nothing but snow except for a small patch of color near the top of a drift grabbing at the color revealed a cloak and beneath it a man to the right was another man mostly covered with snow help me fritha yelled as she grabbed under one mans arms to lift him up her companions sheathed their weapons and complied carrying both men back looking to faint light of the inn seemed like it was an eternity away biting wind and chilling temperatures made everything numb her hands refused to work her eyes where blinded by tears her nose ran freely her breath came out in great smoke gusts but she held on and with every step brought them closer to the safety of the inn holding her breath she counted again as she approached the stone stairs that lead down to the front door of the inn mostly covered in snow it was chore to not slip and drop her heavy cargo the door opened blinding her eyes in a yellow light and showering her with a gust of inviting warm air how she want to be inside and away from the form discomfort of the elements moving to a chair closest to the hearth she deposited her frozen unconscious package in the chair and got on her knee to inspect her newest patient looking at the innkeeper and his large framed wife i need blankets and dry clothes for these men quickly fritha stated sternly nodding causing his long beard to fold into his chest the innkeeper turned and rush to complete the task looking at the innkeepers wife i need a bucket of hot water for bathing some warm water for drinking and another empty bucket fritha instructed the innkeepers wife bowed her head and went to fetch the water looking at her patient in front of her revealed a human of broad stature thick eyebrows strong nose and patchy beard his thin lips were chapped to bleeding his cheeks rosy and wind burnt and his ears beat red and showed early stages of frostbite his sweaty frozen gear is green and brown garb that steamed as the snow slowly melted from his shoulders and back at his back a medium wooden shield was attached at his belt a long sword and hatchet were frosted with ice removing his weapons and giving them to erik for safe keeping incase these men were not of the pleasant kind fritha removed his deerskin gloves revealing long strong hands that had started showing traces of frostbite erik would you please take these weapons to the room and retrieve my healing bag fritha asked erik took the other mans staff bag of spell components and small dagger and left toward the stairs she looked at the other unconscious man which showed her that he was a syndar with finer features but not the finest that she has seen he had lighter skin pinked and roughed by the elements raven color brows and hair and clean shaven he was of a lighter build but a wiry build his vest is of black leather with a bright red tunic which was soaked through with sweat and melted snow heavy footsteps announced the return of the girthed innkeeper here are the blankets and clothes that you requested maam i got clothes from both of my boys i hope they fit he stuttered as he put the bundles on the nearest table i will bring you and your crew a draft of mead free of charge you and your pack have done a very noble thing finding these poor souls before the blizzard claimed them he bowed before retiring to the back to get the drinks and food bjorn help me remove their soaked clothes fritha said gently as she removed the green garbed humans cloak are they severely injured bjorn inquired not from what i see frostbite has started setting in but nothing that would require my healing magic or amputation she said with a shudder they look very dehydrated and exhausted the syndar looks the worst though he must have used all his energy to keep them warm and cast the light thank gaia he did otherwise he and his companion would have frozen within the hour stated bjorn as he removed the crimson tunic revealing a torso wiry and devoid of hair that fritha anticipated removing the humans forest green tunic revealed a barrel torso with large muscles and a mat of black chest hair glistening with sweat upon seeing the humans bare torso brought back fond memories of thrand her mate pushing those memories to the back of her mind she shed the rest of his clothing and donned him with the barrowed clothes and wrapped him in blankets bjorn did the same upon finishing he went to the wood box and gathered a couple dried oak logs and tossed them into the insatiable hearth the fire crackled in response as small flames licked at the dried wood more footsteps showed erik approaching with her healers bag following him was the innkeepers burly wife with the buckets of water looking at erik she told him to gather the men and have food and drink but stay close if i need you nodding in response erik and bjorn went to the far end of room where innkeeper had brought out a steamy roast and tankards of mead turning back to her task she and the innkeepers wife sasha she learned split the steamy water into two buckets and put their patients chilled feet into the steamy water she learned that doing this would relieve the traces of frostbite on their feet and also raise their core temperature fritha retrieved healing salve from her pack and started applying it to the wind burnt skin on her patients faces she finished applying healing ointment to the syndar when started applying it to the chap lips of human when he took a deep breath and started to stir he opened his eyelids revealing rich brown eyes that darted to and fro where are we he stated weakly you are at the hidden gem inn i barely spotted your companions magefire in the blizzard we found you in a drift and brought you here who are you and what are you doing traveling in this terrible weather fritha said as she sat down in a chair thank the gods you found us he said as he struggled to get into a better sitting position i will tell you everything that you wish to know but i ask that you take my friend and lay him in a bed he is likely not going to wake till the morning he was using his magic to ward off the wind and the cold lucky you found us though his magic started fail two hours ago fritha studied the man for a moment and then tasked her companions to stop their meal and take the syndar to a vacant room grumbling at the disruption of their meal erik and bjorn complied lifting the syndar as if he weighed nothing fritha then gathered two tankards and a bottle of mead and returned to the human staring at the fire lost in his thoughts filling a tankard with mead for herself she filled the other of warmed water for the human she handed the tankard to the human which he nodded his thanks ok talk she said and he did the water in the tankard was warm and felt great on his scratchy throat looking at the mug showed it was speckled with blood from his lips no doubt he thought lifting his fingers to his lips confirmed weeping furious splits the ulven maiden in front of him his savior asked for him to talk not normally the one to disclose a lot about himself but this cleric from the look of her bag and attire saved him and brodins ass marcus and his best friend hell his only friend almost died again he was so tired so so tired she might be able to help us not us me he thought hope youre comfortable this might take a while he said ive got time who are you and your companion she insisted my name is marcus clearbrook and my friend the syndar is brodin fizzlewick i dont know a whole bunch about brodin other than he is a half syndar and an apprentice mage and a decent guy most of the time me on the other hand will tell ya whatever you want marcus said as he downed the rest of the water and motioned for the ulven maiden to fill his tankard up fritha motioned for the water none of that water i would like some mead to warm my blood he insisted feeling ragged and exhausted upon filling his tankard with golden mead he started back to the beginning i was born in 240 in the northern forests of aldoria near a farming community call arkos nice farms they had there some of the best in all of aldoria the mayor would say they had all different types too pigs cattle sheep and a few ranches strictly for aldorian horses my father was an apprentice tanner in arkos when he met my mother the mayors daughter explained marcus as he gave his savior a knowing wink she tilted her head to the side and looked like she didnt get the meaning they fell in love and wished to marry upon asking for the mayors blessing the mayor laughed in my fathers face and exclaimed that his daughters hand is meant for one the rich horse barons that will increase is horses stock and get himself a seat at the capitol and no lowly reeking tanner is going to botch his plans for being part of the court taking a taste of mead the thick sweet wine made from honey prompted marcus to go on my mother was a strong willed woman and she wasnt going to be married off to a pansy nobleman as my father used to tell me memories came flooding back almost bringing tears to his eyes the blood from his lips on the mug didnt help keeping these thoughts and memories at bay they ran away never found out how they got away or how they evaded the pursuit of the mayor but they did found a wandering druid to marry them settled down built a house on the furthest edge of the forest my father became a woodsman supplying lumber to the local sawmill i was born shortly thereafter along with keeping an eye on me she would keep a large garden and keep a few animals for milk eggs and meat my mother being the mayors daughter had all the best education to which she imparted on me and she would always told me that i should look for the best in people taking another drink from the mead in hopes that it would prevent the memories from coming back it failed tears burned marcuss eyes worse than the whipping blizzard winds outside fighting them back he continued my father always taught me to be strong independent selfsufficient reliable strong and a good man my father taught me to hunt fish harvest wood and always help those who are less fortunate than you i was about 10 or 11 i cant remember but that is when the undead came catching his breath as the memories threatened to render him a crying babe marcus saw images of his mothers throat getting ripped out a shambling undead that had broke into the house she couldnt scream as blood fountained from her throat father roared in despair and defiance as he picked up his ax and chopped at his wifes killer he was quickly overrun by three other undead monsters ripping holes his garb and his flesh he screamed out to me to run i used the crawl space at the base of my bed and i ran blinking back tears marcus came back to the hidden gem inn and his savior waiting patiently for him to continue i escaped the shambling horde to the nearest farm where i warned the farmer and his wife about what happened the farmer sent me down the road with his wife as he went to warn his nearby neighbors the farmers wife and i made our way to arkos as we approached hours later and the dawn was starting to grey the sky we could smell the smoke of burning buildings and flesh before we saw that the town of arkos was destroyed utterly we made our way to the as fast as we could down the main road to the nearest port city korren delirious and exhausted from days of quick travel with little food we made our way to the korren he said as he took another drink of his mead hands shaking the whole time we joined the other masses of refugees heading toward the korren for shelter we caught sight of the city walls and felt a surge of hope the farmers wife started weeping openly and fell to her knees i didnt know what she was weeping for could have been the realization that her husband was most likely dead or that she might find sanctuary by the gray walls i just felt numb dead my parents were gone and i had nothing then i saw a figure in dirty rags come behind the kneeling weeping farmers wife quietly slip a dagger in her back and take the bag with our meager rations spare clothes and what coin she had it all happened so fast that i just stared as her body crumpled to the ground and was still people just moved around us not caring their own fears and care their only thoughts i just stood there not sure how to feel fear anger sorrow i knew not marcus explained as he looked down at his cold shaking hands no matter how warm it got or how close to the fire he always felt cold alone i started moving again for how far and how long i dont remember the next thing that i remember is that people where running past me screaming i looked behind me and saw that people were getting slaughtered by the shambling undead monsters along with the penitent one by one the zombies took down the weak and tired refugees i started running toward the walls i ran till my legs gave way and i was on the ground crawling so close to the walls not more than 100 hundred yards i looked behind me and saw a horde of undead zombies shambling toward the nave korren walls what demented entity that drove this putrid army to devour all in its path i couldnt fathom the first one passed me then the second and then the third many more passed me fresh and old corpses moved past groaning for some insatiable need that will be satisfied by reaching the wall and devouring what lies beyond then one looked at me she was maybe my age at one time when her heart still beat her golden hair was matted to hear head and her skin grey one side of face showed that she was pretty but the left side of her was face was missing much of its flesh most of her cheek was missing only shreds of putrid flesh covered her baby teeth the most of the right side of her neck was ripped out which made her head tilt toward the side where there simply wasnt any support she lifted one hand out to me almost pleading that i could help her my heart beat frantically my breath came out in wild breaths was this the end would i meet my family again or would i be trapped as a shambling monstrosity always hungry for something that i would never find i put my arm over my eyes as i screamed finishing the tankard in one long chug marcus looked at his hands to see that they no longer shook he has been staring at the fire for so long that he didnt notice that all the attendants of the inn was listening to his story of his life the innkeeper was standing with his arm around his wife their two boys sitting at their feet his savior was still sitting but had her hands clasped with a prayer intertwined between her fingers her staunch companions standing on either side of her their faces grim can i get another mug please markus stated meekly suddenly nervous his saviors left companion complied his facial expression never changing what happened next marcus heard as he turned his head to the youngest of the innkeepers boys perhaps no more than twelve years old his eyes wide with fear and anticipated in what would happen next marcus smiled i thought was i finished the wretched stench of this girl monster stole my breath away as she positioned herself about to take a bite out of my middle then i heard a thunk i looked from behind my arm and i saw the monsters head lying on my stomach protruding from the back of her head was an axe handle the beard of the axe was buried deep into her head but she still moved very slowly but still very much active then a gloved hand grabbed under my arm and pulled me up from under the stunned decaying monster i was thrown over a strong mailed shoulder and held into place with his right arm his left arm held a medium size kite shield which he used to bash his way through the undead in his way i could only see what was behind him undead people with their mouths open in a silent scream and arms outstretched pleading to the living to help them i looked up and saw the massive wooden doors of the korren loom up above me as we squeezed through a small crack the doors closed behind us the iron bindings around the inside of the massive oak beams severed putrid hands that unfortunately got in the way soldiers in all sorts of tabards lowered a massive plank that locked the doors into place other soldiers pounded wooden spikes into the earth to brace more planks to support the door marcus took a drink from his full mug of could hear the audible sighs from the innkeepers family all visibly relaxed that he narrowly survived the undead onslaught taking a deep breath marcus continued the knight at least i thought he was a knight lowered me to the ground looked at my eyes and asked if i was bitten am i hurt i looked at his piercing blue eyes and shook my head no he looked at my arms and legs and under my burlap smock to see that i was telling the truth where was my parents he asked i pointed out beyond the walls and said gone he lowered his head and looked at the wall then down a road to our right what is your name boy the knight asked me i said marcus clearbrook he nodded and picked me up and ran down the street yelling for the refugees to make way shaking his head to this day marcus had no idea why he was spared why the knight cared if he lived or died what prompted him to save him instead of someone more deserving he wasnt anyone special just marcus a single tear rolled down his cheek as took a drink saying a silent prayer of thanks to his previous savior who is probably no longer among the living i closed my eye to try escape seeing the panicked faces of the refuges cluttered in the streets but i could still hear them the moans the cries the screams the air was thick with fear after what seemed like an eternity i smelled fish offal and salt brine i opened my eyes to see that we arrived at a near empty pier a few frantic sailors were getting in small fishing boats and sailing boats and taking them into open waters braving the open seas seems like a better option than dealing with the undead horde at the end of the pier there was a single long boat that was still loading supplies and a few people i heard the knight grunt as he doubled his efforts and ran down the wooden pier toward the long boat as we got closer to the boat the knight called out crass the knights footsteps slowed and he put me down i looked up and a giant of a man in flowing clothing filled my vision the knight and i assume crass got into a heated discussion about what to do with me i didnt hear much of the conversation because i was looking out in the bay to see a large ship i had never seen such a large ship except in the books that my mother would show me she also told me stories of how brave men went on such ships and went on amazing adventures i remember tears falling down my cheeks as i thought of my mother a long yawn from one of the listeners stopped marcus and he realized that he had been talking for a couple hours now and the night must be getting late the innkeeper whispered to his wife and she nodded sleepily thank you for your help present and future but we old folk grow weary and must retire for the evening to bed with you boys and wife good night the innkeeper stated with a half bow after herding his lethargic group toward the back of the inn which marcus assumed was their living quarters marcus turned back to the sitting ulven and her two standing companions unmoving almost as if they were cast out of stone yes the hour goes late and there is a lot of work to do when the sun comes up finish your tale marcus but please keep it short the ulven woman said as she stood up and stretched her legs right ummm i found out later that the giant looking man was in fact captain crass and owed a debt to the knight to which i found out later was lieutenant albert of the city guard and the good lieutenant risked his life to save the captains brother from a tavern fire two seasons before captain crass stated that the ship was already over capacity and he couldnt afford to feed another mouth i suspected that crass knew that the lieutenant would stay behind to fight the undead legion i suppose he wanted to clear the debt or else the knights ghost might haunt him till the debt was paid crass reluctantly agreed to take me as the crew started rowing away from the pier i looked back at the knight he was a tall built man with a ripped and faded tabard over rust splotched chain the shield on this left arm was dented and much of paint chipped away but it shown clearly in the cloudy sunlight he raised an arm toward me in a tired wave turned and lightly jogged down the pier toward the besieged city i turned to captain crass he had a long scraggly brown beard with flecks of grey starting to mix in he had a scar on one cheek that started at his nose and extended down to his jaw line i remember him telling me that everyone works on his ship and if i didnt work i would be thrown overboard he asked what i could do what i knew i told him i could read and write tend a garden and catch small game he said that i was to take all the names of the all the people on the ship and when rations were dispersed i was to make a note that they received their rations if someone got double rations or he found out that rations were stolen i would get flogged the first time and then tossed over the second time i stayed in the captains quarters on a bed of rags we stayed on the ship for many weeks i lost count eventually we landed on mardrun at new aldoria i was then tasked with working with the dock master inventorying stores and rations i did that for many years caring for cargo and honing my reading and writing skills i didnt have any family and didnt really socialize with people only the occasional fishing trip and i would sometimes help out an old tanner slaughter beef for their leather most of the time i stayed in a basement room of an inn near the docks some nights i worked hauling casks of beer and wine to thirsty patrons  i soon found out that my foreman was embezzling cargo and funds from the docks and selling them to bandits outside the city one of offloading crew found out and informed the city guards one evening when he was brought for questioning the snake pinned the whole scheme on me i then heard that he bribed the captain and sent the guards bring me in and hang me i had just bought a new tunic and was returning from the seamstress who i had my eye on but was to cowardly to ask her to share a meal i was about to turn the corner to the inn door when i overheard the guards interrogate the tavern owner of my whereabouts the innkeeper said that he would send his son to get the guards when i returned so i snuck back into my room using the hatch at the back of the inn where brought casks of mead and ale gathered my things and left the city never to go back if i could help it  i stayed off the road and made my way slowly through the late fall underbrush going in a southerly direction toward the new hope colony i trapped small game for my meat rations and drank cold water from the brooks that i came across no more than two days of leaving new aldoria i was just finishing a midday snack when i heard the sound of voices from the road i feared either the city garrison pursuing me or a bunch of bandits that would liberate me of my gear so i crawled slowly to investigate i moved behind a large oak and bunch of bushes to see three figures confronting a lone figure the three figures had their backs to me but they were dressed mostly in black they had small capes and i could see that they were fully armed with swords shields and bows these men were prepared for a fight what type of fight i didnt know yet beyond the three armed men i could see was the lone figure that they were addressing he was covered mostly in a thick black cloak which was pulled far enough forward that i couldnt make out his face he also kept his cloak closed so i couldnt see if he was armed the lead bandits where asking if the cloaked man was deaf because they asked him for his stuff or they were going to kill him one of the bandits drew his sword and walked to about a yard between him and the cloaked figure the bandit asked again if he didnt hear him and pointed his sword in the other mans face in an instant the cloaked man flung open his cloak which revealed bright red and black garb and a small dagger at his side in the instant that his cloak flew open a royal blue ball of energy flew from his right hand striking the surprised bandit in the chest he instantly fell to his knees and screamed in pain the man in red then took his dagger and cut the staggered bandits throat producing a stream of crimson blood the bandits companions yelled in anger and drew weapons one grabbed his sword hefted his shield and charged the second unslung his bow and knocked an arrow the bandit that charged got there in two strides wound back the sword to strike the now apparent mage down before the weapon came a foot from the mages neck the mage cast another spell that sent the attacking bandit flying off the road and into a bunch of brambles the other bandit fired his black arrow at the mage which he was not prepared to receive or so i thought the arrow flew true and would have pierced the man in reds heart but as the arrow touched the mages garb it broke into a shower of splinters obviously some sort of mages armor i assumed he hasnt told me much of his spells yet but the bandit archer wasnt deterred he knocked another arrow and was about to aim his bow when i intervened i dont know why i did it but i broke my cover and ran as fast as i could at the archer which wasnt focused on me at all i tackled him in the ribs which i heard his breath leave his lungs and maybe some of his ribs breaking we fell into the ditch on the furthest side of the road in a heap i then took my small utility hatchet and buried it in the side of his head i looked back toward the mage to see that he had a spell set in his hand that seemed to change colors in the light i also saw that the other bandit that he pushed into brambles was sneaking behind him he also saw that he had a spell primed and instead of going for the killing blow he was going to stun him with his shield i yelled for the mage to look out the bandits shield was almost about to connect when he flicked his spell behind himself striking the bandit in the hip but the motion of iron bound shield grazed the side of the mages head which sent him flying and he fell to the ground unconscious the bandit also fell to the ground stunned i removed my hatchet from the archers head and ran to the kill the stunned bandit i then checked on the mage to see if he was seriously hurt not finding any serious wounds i proceeded to loot the bodies i looted a few coin a sword shield and meager rations from the bandits the mage slowly started to come around and i held my hands up to signify that i didnt mean him any harm he held his head in pain and muttered thanks i saw some birch trees and went to collect some of the bark my father always told me that chewing on birch and willow bark was good for dulling pain i learned this when i broke my ankle a couple years before the undead attacked i told the mage to chew on some of the bark to dull the pain he looked at me skeptically but complied the mage then introduced himself as brodin fizzlewick a phoenix syndar and an apprentice mage he was making his way to new hope to meet some people since we were both going toward the new hope colony we decided to travel together he retrieved his satchel and we traveled together for a week before we got caught up in this blizzard and the rest you know hearing his tale come to the end marcus felt light headed and somehow elated he has not talked this much to anyone in many years he talked with brodin but only in spurts they were always on the lookout for game or bandits brodin always seemed like the reserve type anyway and didnt feel like explaining much from what marcus could gather out of brodin is that he was orphaned as well and was trying to make mardun a better place for human and syndar alike must be nice to find someplace that gives you purpose he thought marcus now just noticed that the water that his feet were in has run cold the fire has reduced down to smoldering coals marcus lifted the tankard to his chaffed lips to swallow the last of his mead what are you going to do now asked one of the ulven men i dont know really go to new hope and pray i find something maybe travel with brodin and join the phoenix marcuse said absent mindedly he doubted the last part the phoenix are a pretty wellknown group of merchants and he didnt have any training in a trade nor was he syndar the only thing he could do was read write trap and butcher game not exactly the fanciest of professions nothing is going to get done tonight i would recommend that you all get some sleep fritha said as she made her way to the stairs marcus nodded and followed her and her companions up the stairs his bones and muscles protesting all the way at the top of the stairs he saw one of the ulven men point to a room we put your friend in this room there is a second bed in there for yourself we are keeping your weapons till the morning muttering a small thank you marcus went into the room the barely lit room was commonly furnished with two beds in opposite corners a small table in the center with a wash basin and a simple wardrobe behind the entrance seeing the bed marcus dropped the blanket that was keeping him warm all evening and fell into the surprisingly comfortable bed the last thing he remembered hearing was the blizzard whipping across the little inn and the light snoring of his friend finally safe maybethe winter solstice written by jimmy mccann winter 263 the darkest longest night of the year the winter solstice under a new moon the great hunter begins his stalk across the clear night sky with faolan and sapphira making preparations for the ritual under the twilight canopy thats not where the candles go faolan but sapphira why not i thought it was an interesting design i made around the circle we go over this every time we cast a circle you know the candles are supposed to go on the other three cardinal points their circle measures ten paces wide with a teepee of wood prepared in the east and more wood stacked just outside the circle enough for a fire to burn all night in the center is a simple wooden altar draped in a cloth of silver and blue and adorned with branches of evergreen and stems of mistletoe on the altar is an offering of grain and vegetables gathered from some of the locals autumn harvest the still air hangs thick with frankincense cinnamon and myrrh from the incense burning around the altar sapphira ok i think everything is set lets begin sapphira retires to a small tent just southwest of their circle to change into a flowing white robe then faolan to change into loose white pants and a white smock then they approach their circle from the west with sapphira carrying a small stick alit at the tip with faolan standing behind her sapphira kneels down to light the western candle while reciting her first incantation tonight is the night of the solstice the longest night of the year as the wheel turns once more i know that tomorrow sol will begin his journey back to us with it new life will begin a blessing from gaia to her children sapphira rises and proceeds towards the altar with faolan trailing her at the altar sapphira turned and headed north leaving faolan to stand guard at the altar with faolan watching her every move sapphira kneels to light the northern candle while reciting her second incantation it is the season of the winter goddess tonight i celebrate the festival of the winter solstice the rebirth of sol and the return of light to gaia as the wheel of the year turns once more i honor the eternal cycle of birth life death and rebirth sapphria then rises and heads to the southern edge of their circle passing behind faolan standing on the west side of the altar upon reaching the southern candle she kneels to light it while reciting her last incantation today i honor the god of the forest the king of nature who rules the season i give my thanks to the beautiful goddess whose blessings bring new life to gaia these gifts i offer you tonight sending my prayers to you upon the air after pausing for a moment sapphira returns to faolan at the altar together they step around the north side of the altar and head towards the eastern edge of their circle at the wood teepee faolan kneels down and pulls out his hunting knife and a piece of flint he strikes the back edge of his knife against the flint sending a spark into a bed of dry grass at the heart of the teepee he quickly leans in to breathe life into the flames and once the kindling has caught he begins chanting as he chants he tips back to take a seat to the northwest of the fire with sapphira sitting down to the southwest of the fire faolans chanting continues with faolans chant carrying into the night they sit in meditation upon the fire and the coming of brighter days but a singular inescapable thought creeps into faolans mind eventually the fire burns down eventually the candles grow dim eventually the darkness winsfaolans journal entries written by jimmie mccann faolans journal  entry 37 lately weve found ourselves traveling with this collection of humans and ulven that came across us on their way into whiteoak territory to raid some of the weaker outposts for supplies before winter hits full force at first we were just glad for the company since we had been on the road by ourselves for so long but had little interest in participating in their raids we didnt feel that the ulven clans that were against the colonists needed any more reasons to want the colonists gone discussions around the nightly fires allowed us to get updated on what had been happening between the clans and what we learned was more disturbing than previous news we had heard we were also offered a safe haven at the outpost this group had originated from and at the home of part of this group that call themselves rangers of crows landing with the increasing tensions between the ulven and the colonists and between the clans on opposite sides of the issue we realized how valuable a single safe haven could be let alone two the one who appears to be the leader of the rangers also showed a great interest in the arcane but lacked some of the skill necessary to harness its power he has a book with a wealth of information about the arcane that i am eager to get a closer look at at last the raiding party finally came to the edge of whiteoak territory and we had to make a decision on whether or not to join them now on the eve of our first raid i can only hope that sapphira and i made the correct choice and we will come out the other side of this better off faolans journal  entry 41 we made it just barely with the help of a group of humans from the raiding party that call themselves the brotherhood of the long winter we managed to escape whiteoak territory with more than just our lives once we were finally out we decided to go our own way for a bit we had some decisions to make do we want to throw our lot in with the coalition would we really have a choice in the end how much longer would we be able to survive on our own with so many ulven siding against the colonist we knew that we would need a place to weather the coming storm to have any chance of surviving i must also admit that curiosity influenced my decision i want to know all of what crows landing the rangers and tobias have to offer then there is the odd character that popped into existence just outside the raiding camp while we were in whiteoak territory according to his own story he recalled from faedrun seventy years ago if he is to be believed if one could survive seventy years in the mana stream he could have some of the answers i have been seeking if he does not have my answers he has at least shown to have some abilities that i think would be useful to learn he also seems almost too eager to obtain students to teach last i saw he was on his way to crows landing with tobias and the rangers regardless of my curiosity we needed a place to get off the road for a while and crows landing would get us a little bit further away from whiteoak with that we are setting out for crows landing faolans journal  entry 43 about a day out from crows landing we caught up with the rangers and our odd friend from the past on their way to the village the rumors of the road were that bandits were closing in looking for easy scores tobias offered us a bit of coin to help secure the road to crows landing we quickly found out the rumors of bandits were indeed true but we were successful in sending them on their way the wiser ones went to their next target the rest were sent to whatever awaits in the great beyond this also offered an opportunity to learn more about this odd mage vazra and his intentions and study his skills if nothing else fighting beside him showed me that i would not want to fight against him but our conversations also revealed that he may be someone we can trust tentatively i have heard tobias and vazra discussing at length building a mages college in crows landing it would seem that the college would be part of a payment for teaching tobias with the rest of the payment being supplying students for the college sapphira and i also took vazra up on an offer for a place in this college as archons with sapphiras alchemy we might have just found a place where our usefulness wont run out anytime soon for now we are alive off the road and in crows landing waiting to see what tobias and the rangers have in store for us and what vazra has planned with us with sapphira able to do some harvesting and now having a chance to replenish her stocks i feel that we are on a good path so farjournal of salguod written by mason rower day 26 of october a month ago i went to see my foster parents my foster mother arianna told me of a dream that she felt came from her deity the moon goddess lunara she told me that she saw a wolf and an icicle near a building with a shield on the ground by the door the shield had an emblem of a moon and star i may have an idea of where that may lead because that emblem is the emblem of pack stargazer from clan spiritclaw as selena has told me in the past i need to find where this information leads but i must hold off and figure out what is going on with this war for i have told stanrick that i will join him in the raids against the whiteoak he knows that i am in search of my people its as good of a place to start whiteoak here i come day 3 of january it has been many months since i have written of my exploits today i have finally brought forth the fruition of plans i have been meaning to attend to my plans for finally bringing my pack back together as one since those many years ago the fall i thought my pack was truly gone until the day i came across heather icewolf i had just about given up hope that any of my people were alive now i know that they are alive the time has come that my people be brought together i have talked with pack chieftain stanrick and his mate former truth seeker selena about my plight and they were accepting they are both great friends to have my only regret is that i will have to leave the vandregon and go my own way william has been a great friend to me these past years and i will be grateful for his friendship and guidance he is one of the only humans i will ever truly trustpersonal journal entries for saphira written by melanie houghton  whiteoak territories  november it was a treacherous trek that faolan and i got ourselves into but after all of my supplies had been looted i needed some time to think how was i going to rebuild the inventory that i received from my family before they were murdered other than their memory thats all i had left of them our new goal was to somehow replace all that was lost we were invited to come along with a caravan of raiders who were headed to whiteoak territory these were the same whiteoaks who had raided my supplies i was all in i wanted to know if this caravan of travelers had the audacity to raid the whiteoak camps after waiting by their winters warm fire i was able to have peace of mind knowing that faolan would be more than willing to fight in my honor he was not able to retrieve any of my supplies but he did give them a piece of his mind i sat and watched him when he returned from the first raid he meditated a great while the snow fell upon him as if he were a statue made of stone unscathed faolan was more interested in vazra a mage who apparently recalled through time itself and appeared in the woods just before we set up camp he was mindless as he tried to tell the warriors of his travels he was definitely out of it i suspect his symptoms to be the after effects of his landing this vazra reminds me a little of my people from nara pentare i am not certain how yet but i am sure ill figure it out eventually after a long long while the second raiding party had returned we began packing up to leave enemy territories when the whiteoak sent an attack faolan and i had diverted the attack but were soon met at the borders of our allies by another group of them luckily we brought some of the caravan travelers with us sometimes not being a combative person has its worries but i had the protection of others crowslanding  december the winter is mild but with a lacking of supplies it has been less than easy bartering for other supplies we need luckily faolan and i decided to take refuge with the caravan and we are traveling back to their outpost with them it has been hard trusting people after the murder of my family so the trip has not been so pleasant i only just recently started trusting vazra i cant pinpoint exactly yet but he reminds me of home i have also started trusting some of the rangers the rangers are or were part of the whiteoak raids we are traveling to crows landing crows landing is where the rangers call home traveling with strangers is not easy especially when you have no room in your heart for newcomers i am in a constant state of feeling alone the only one i have known is faolan with minimal supplies i am fearful we will not survive winter luckily i was able to pick up some harvesting tools i have slowly started to replenish my stores on our way to crows landing faolan and i started to get to know vazra a little better i still am having trouble figuring out why he reminds me of home maybe i have been away from my people for far too long i am getting home sick hopefully i can hide it from faolan he has been so great i feel like he would be mad if i spoke of back home especially after we have gotten this far i will keep my secrets to myself hopefully i will have supplies enough to make potions potions which could keep me from the remembrance of home i know the only thing i would remember is how they all died crying i can recall my fathers blood spraying my adrenaline kissed face i grabbed my mother and ran for the forest but we were separated and she was caught headless she lay in the town center after all had settled and the enemy had left i snuck back into town to gather my now stolen supplies and i fled for new land now i am with people i cant fathom trusting what am i to do my bartering skills are less than fruitful without anything to offer bartering is how i got away from home it is how i got this far as we are getting closer to crows landing my comfort levels are increasing everyone seems to know that i am not one for combat and so i need the others protection if we are faced with war this helps my nerves i am so grateful for their protection however it seems almost as if this people that we travel with ask for the wars i have seen more combat with them than i have traveling on my own it makes me wonder if faolan and i were raided because the whiteoak knew that their enemies were in the territory we just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time i am also frustrated that after raiding their lands my supplies were not found and returned maybe the whiteoak had already rid themselves of them im sure faolan was looking for them when he went in to help the raiders but i am strong i know my way around deceit and i will do whats necessary to survive we are closer to crows landing i can feel danger on the back of my neck i hope there is enough help for whats ahead trusting faolan what are we doing with these people i am having a hard time trying to trust them what if my supplies were found in the raid i find it hard to believe they were not there at least some of them had to be there you ask me so late whether or not we found anything you know ive looked i didnt find anything i do believe that these people have not taken things for themselves i know your trust levels are scarce but trying is all we can do they have offered us refuge do you think they would offer it to us if they werent just because they offered us safety does not mean they are friends with us i am grateful for the refuge but i still am quite concerned that these people are foes where is your concern we have traveled thus far without the support cant we just try to travel on our own and find ways to replenish my supplies no the winter is going to be hard to handle on our own without your supply just wait this out with me and i promise we will come out on top though faolan thinks we will come out on top i still believe we have to watch out we have arrived at crows landing and the rangers are setting up camp trying to figure out what has been going on in their land apparently bandits are attacking and have been trying to subdue the rangers in order to obtain some fear and supplies or at least that is what i understand faolan and i have joined vazra to get the mages together i am not a mage but faolan is and he is my protection it is hard to understand why but i still think vazra has some characteristics of home i am studying him to figure it out as for now i am looking for reagents in the surrounding areas i need to rebuild what i have lost there are guards at the trail entrances so i feel somewhat protected but i still feel danger lurking its not deniable to feel war is upon us when we have chosen raiders to follow there are some strange people who entered the area they are perceived to be merchants but people lie about who they are all the time after some time had gone by the rangers and their syndar company had been poisoned by food that the merchants passed out luckily i am still having hard times trusting and i convinced faolan not to eat any the rangers pretty much paid to be poisoned i knew there was something untrustworthy of those folk when they hid in the trees after entering the camp i was scared about what was to come next i knew that not after too long there would be other bandits to take advantage of the poisoned folk i hid behind the brotherhood who had also been travel companions for the caravan to crows landing after the fight was through things seemed to have calmed down not too long after we started travel out of crows landing faolan whats next are you sure we are with safe travelers  giving thanks i am still untrusting of some but as we travel together i am finding it less difficult have we found a place to call home i am hoping that we will have somewhere to lay our heads while i replenish my supplies maybe make some silver faolan are we going to honor the winter i need to pray for the nature i have gathered and will gathered so that maybe we will have great luck in finding more when the cold finally retreats and life begins to bloom again we will in good time after setting up my ritual i begin to honor the winter solstice i am giving my thanks for all that was given we had set up some way away from the others but i could still hear them in the distance around their winter fire drinking to stay warm the cold has really started to take a strong hold on the lands i sit and listen to the surroundings meditate in the glory of nature its calming to know that i can rely on it for survival i feel as long as i praise and thank for what i take it will continue to provide our journey onward will begin again at dawn i will be ready to take on a new year faolan i think that we have found a people to travel with i know i had my doubts before but i feel as though we have safety while we stay and for that i am happy thank you for trusting we will be okay here with these people i told you we would make it all the wars we have seen and we continue to come out unscathed thats because they fight to protect what and who is with themin a dream she sees the coast of stormjarl the

she intends to find outthe curious ulven krigspel or game of battle a rules folio by fentiman thatcher of new hope commissioned by duke joakim ventrini foreward honored duke i was quite pleased when you requested that i record and codify the rules to this curious ulven game your patronage as always is greatly appreciated in these troubling times and i will see that your love of the ulven and their culture is spread throughout the colonies to the more casual reader while i still mourn the loss of our beloved homeland this new world has much to offer from hardship comes perseverance and i hope that you might find strength in our neighbors the ulven people while we have many differences it is said that the love of games is something that unites all people and so i would present to you  in the spirit of jolly cooperation  this document containing the rules to a uniquely ulven game referred to as krigspel by their people much of my research came from my travels to clan goldenfield who possess a keen love of this game in their leisuretime i was assisted in learning the rules by an older rather learned ulven  in exchange for several texts and a promise of anonymity he helped me to understand the rules of the game i understand and respect his desire for privacy  while we have excellent relations with many of our new ulven neighbors the recent war amongst the ulven seems to be concerned with our presence here and his apparently higher social status may suffer should his work with me be discovered i should hope that engaging in mutual sport will assist in the building of good relationships amongst our peoples  i know my helper has commented quite highly on sir nevans brother a recentlyscribed play from our time here and if the older ulven are interested in our art then perhaps it is time that more exchanges occur the history of the game my guide to ulven culture explained the game as growing out of a need to train warriors at a younger age as well as provide an outlet for friendly competition amongst the various hunters and warriors in the various packs and clans its rules while simple seem to foster tactical thinking and cooperation amongst the players according to my theories the game may have sprung up from ritualized reenactments of battles against their hated foes the mordok the ball which is oftentimes called huvuinn or the head may have once been a severed head and the violence of the sport may have once been played out with actual sharpened blades my companion assured me quite harshly that there is no evidence of this but i would assume that he has little knowledge of the scholarship and research conducted on faedrun  after all the ulven despite all of their wonderous culture still seem to struggle with the written word and prefer oral storytelling a lower art form than that of the play or novel it is no wonder that my host expressed such interest in the books and plays of my countrymen on the players a team is composed of nine players  two of whom are designated as the healers and who do not enter play except to retrieve the blades of fallen players on their team teams typically mark themselves in a distinct way  i have seen many methods to do so such as scraps of coloured fabrics or pigments added to the face and hair there are always five players per team on the field  any more and the team is penalized typically by losing a point although harsher actions may lead to players being ejected typically however it is performed in the spirit of leisure rather than of fierce competition  even if the distinction is difficult to detect amongst our savage cousins additionally a scorekeeper is required  typically a pair are appointed one for each target although this is not required on the field a field or pitch is a markedoff area three poles in width and oneandonehalf chains in length along the edge is a narrow corridor typically an ell in width which only the healers are allowed to enter during a game as well as sites on both corners of a teams side for the players held in reserve to enter the field these corridors  two ells in width  are the only places players may be the boundaries are often marked off with pitch chalk or other temporary materials on grass it is recommended that the field be fairly open so that the players do not trip or injure themselves too badly it is forbidden for anyone other than the players to enter the field during a game and rowdy spectators may find themselves unceremoniously tossed out by the players on the equipment the game requires three major pieces of equipment  the blades the targets and the ball beginning with the simplest the ball is typically made of rags wrapped together to form a ball roughly the size of a human head with a long trailing tail to allow the players to carry it it cannot be cast or struck during a game but instead is carried loosely in the offhand of a player the targets are typically large barrels  one is placed on either end of the field to serve as a basket for the ball the blades are training weapons  constructed of the hard woods native to mardrun and balanced similarly to the ulvens typical blades according to their rules the weapon may be no longer than an ell in length  this is checked by laying all of a teams blades across the healers boundary and discarding any that pass over the lines no effort seems to have been made to pad them and as has been demonstrated they are still quite capable of injuring someone should the players grow too enthusiastic each team must provide five blades for their team and be able to provide a replacement should one break during the normal play of the game physical contact is somewhat frequent and i have observed more than one blade cracking under the stress imposed upon it on play the game begins with five players on each side each lining up on the same edge as their target with each player bearing one of their wooden blades the ball is placed in the center and the scorekeeper signals the start of that play the players then rush to the center attempting to grab the ball and place it in their opponents target barrel to complicate things players may use their swords to strike their opponent  a player who is struck must kneel down immediately holding their blade aloft to signal that they have been killed they remain in position until a healer enters the field to retrieve their blade  once the healer leaves the field with their blade they may return to their teams reserve at which point another player from their team may enter the field once they have

brief break at the halfway point to switch ends for the teamson the games and passtimes of the old and new world as commissioned by dominet martingale of westhaven all cultures tend to invent games and methods for leisure these activities are also seen as an avenue for gambling which is a passtime alternately praised and decried by the various faiths of faedrun nevertheless the peoples of faedrun have a great number of games many of which traveled with them to mardrun when fleeing the advances of the undead contained within this manuscript are the rules and playmethods for a number of passtimes recorded so that their knowledge might be dispersed to a certain standard amongst innkeepers gamblers and others seeking methods of passing time as with all manuscripts of this sort payment has been secured for several dozen copies to be made both for public dissemination and the personal libraries of any who might wish to hold as complete a history of the games and passtimes of our own cultures as well as those of the syndar and our new ulven neighbors games utilizing the vandregonian deck before entering into the longer documentations of rules a brief history of the cards is necessary so that the information might be preserved for future generations the standard vandregonian deck is an innovation that began with the noble class to provide entertainment during the times when they were not managing their estates and soon found their way filtering down to the lower classes the original decks were richly illustrated oftentimes depicting the current nobility in the socalled face cards of the deck as well as providing allegorical drawings for the nowcommon number cards when they were imported to the lower classes only the face cards retained their illustrations and the number cards adopted a much simpler pattern these decks found widespread acceptance among the lowerclass especially when their skills allowed them to succeed at gambling the cards were soon exported all across faedrun even finding acceptance amongst the syndar and other rival nations to vandregon as with all exported games a number of games and rule variants sprung up  i have attempted to collect the most common variants available and standardized the various rulesets for those interested in playing where there is gambling one must also be aware of the cheating methods known to socalled sharps typically the most common occurs in the marking of certain cards and the innovation is often attributed to an aldorian gambler who sought more ways to win  this is in part due to the vandregonian belief that aldorians are more apt to cheat at card games which has little basis in my own experience nobles estate originating in vandregon this is a game where players seek to empty their hand as quickly as possible requiring between 4 to 10 players a game designed around gambling most of the rules require payment upon the playing of certain cards as well as when one player empties their hand the game begins with the dealer shuffling and dealing five cards to each player the player to the right of the dealer plays a card should any player have the next card in the sequence they may play it  for example if the first player lays down the six of clubs another player must lay down the seven of clubs if no one can play the next card then the last player to put down a card may begin a new run by laying down another card two cards are special in this game when the queen of diamonds called the mistress of the estate is played all other players must pay three coins to whoever played it when the jack of clubs called the beggar is played all other must pay two coins to whoever played it play ends when one player has no cards in their hand  all other players pay them a single coin for every card they have left in their hands so if there are five players with two of them having one card left in their hand and two having two cards then the winning player would win a total of 6 coins variants are possible as well  some players prefer to pay into a pot and begin each game with twenty marker stones with play ending when one player runs out of marker stones and the pot being divided according to the proportion of stones left or all to the player with the most stones depending on the gambling house commander captain and company a tricktaking game commander captain and company found its origins in richtcrag where gambling is a popular passtime amongst the various mercenaries and they favor tricktaking games over other types of card games one of the earliest tricktaking games and a direct ancestor of tarock play is relatively simple and requires between four and ten players before the start of the game all players agree to a common ante  one coin is the most common as each player pays their ante into three piles  the commander pile the captain pile and the company pile players are then each dealt five cards once all players are dealt their cards the top card is turned over and set aside  this card determines the suit of the trump kings are high aces are low play procedes counterclockwise from the dealer with the player laying down a card to start a trick players must follow suit  that is lay a card down from the same suit if a player cannot do so but has a card from the trump suit they may lay that down instead with it counting of a higher value than the suit of the current trick  an ace of the trump suit is of higher value than the king of the current suit if a player has no cards of the current suit and no trumps they must simply lay down one of their other cards once all players have laid down a card the player who laid the highestvalue card takes the trick and begins the next once all five cards are played the dealer deals each player five new cards and play procedes in this fashion until each player cannot be dealt a new hand of five cards at this point scoring ensues the player who won the most tricks wins the commander pile the player who won the king of the trump suit wins the captain suit the player who has the highestvalue threeofakind amongst the tricks they have taken wins the company pile should no player fulfill the conditions to win any of the piles then the pile carries through to the next hand oftentimes with an added ante for the next round of play oclaochra yet another gambling game of richtcrag this is named for the richlydressed mercenaries which seem endemic to the region this is a simple gambling game requiring a deck of cards and enough wages to lose on it one of the traditions of the region is allowing for credit so as to prolong the length of the game one player acts as the dealer who is required to cover all bets made over the course of the game they set up an ante for the game which all players must match if they wish to take part in the game the dealer begins by dealing two faceup cards off to the side known as the hand cards the dealer then deals themself one card faceup along with a faceup card to each player known as their rjoussance if any of these cards are equal in value to either the hand cards or the dealers card then the dealer wins that round taking all bets and starting a new round of play if they are not equal however the players may then place their antes on their cards and play procedes the dealer draws additional cards one by one and lays them out on the table if a card matches a hand card it is laid next to the hand card  when both hand cards are matched all bets are returned the deck is reshuffled and play begins again if a card matches one of the rjoussance cards then the dealer collects the bet on it removes it from play and leaves the matching card in play if the card matches no other cards then it is left in play and players may place additional antes on it if the card drawn matches the dealers card then the dealer loses and matches all current bets by players on the field in the event of the dealer losing then all cards are collected reshuffled and then dealt for a new hand should the banker wish they may attempt to sell the bank  proceding clockwise around the table each other player may ante how much they are willing to pay for the right to be the bank the player with the highest stated value pays the current dealer and becomes the new dealer playing according to the above rules play ends when the players agree to end the game after a round ends as one might guess this is a game where large sums of money can change hands quite quickly  hence its popularity with richtcrag mercenaries whist a vandregonian tricktaking game popular as a passtime amongst those who wish for a friendly game of cards without betting it is suspected that it evolved from various richtcrag tricktaking games but is unusual in the nature by which it is played  rather than individuals competing against one another play is divided into partnerships a pair of players whose scores are combined unique among partnership games discussion of the cards or of anything other than light conversational matters are forbidden and the game is rarely gambled upon  from my research it is apparent that this variant was developed to distance gambling from play with cards whist is played with four playersthe choice of partners begins before the game it is either agreed upon by all parties or in cases where chance is required by dealing one card faceup to each player the two players with the lowestvalue cards are partners and have choice in where to seat themselves once partners are chosen the game may begin to begin the game the dealer shuffles the deck which is then cut by whomever sits to the dealers right the dealer then deals thirteen facedown cards to each player and then deals a single additional card faceup this is the suit of the trumps for that round of play play procedes as in typical trick taking games starting to the dealers right with the player who takes a trick starting the next one once all the tricks have been taken each partnership totals up their points a partnership earns one point for each trick taken over six  therefore a partnership that takes eight tricks earns three pointsthe game ends when a partnership earns 5 points although it is possible for play to continue if both parties tie at 5 points or if everyone agrees to play to a higher total in gambling variations partners are typically determined via chance and an equal wager is placed by each person involved there are also numerous rules for specific methods to force the ante to increase such as setting a contract  that is the number of tricks your team will take in the coming round or by handicapping one side  declaring that a partnership will reach seven points before the other reaches five is a common bet typically all bets much be matched in these cases although it is seen as extremely untoward to coerce a member of the vandregonian upperclass into wagering on whist games utilizing the richtcrag tarock deck a variant that evolved from the vandregonian deck out of the richtcrags love of cards and gambling the richtcrag tarock deck is an extremely fascinating subject for scholars of games such as myself these decks seen as status symbols amongst the mercenaries and nobility who fill the land are always richly decorated larger in size than a typical vandregonian deck and primarily utilized in complicated tricktaking games it is believed to have found its origin in the valinate region of richtcrag although no definitive first deck exists to prove this theory due to the fractured status of the nation  as well as our own distance from it  it is unlikely that we will ever know the exact origins beyond my speculations aside from being a play tool much mysticism has been ascribed to the richtcrag tarock deck the origins of the mysticism ascribed to it seems to have started via a pair of factors  first was the exportation of a number of tarock decks to vandregon where they were used in various solitarestyle games these games later evolved into a form of fortunetelling aided by the events of the war against the undead which gives the second factor of their mystic description and interpretation  according to various reports by the vandregonian 5th regiment a masked undead creature apparently communicated by utilizing a deck of tarock cards which led to the belief that these cards possessed some mystical powers the creatures erratic behavior as well as the ambiguous nature of the messages it left led to attempts to add symbolic meaning to these cards no evidence prior to this exists and so claims of ancient syndar knowledge distilled into the cards should be greeted with skepticism at best it is this researchers opinion that the monster  which by all descriptions wore noble clothing consistent with a member of the richtcrag nobility  was merely instructed to terrorize the members of the regiment via remnants of its former life and utilized what it had onhand typically the tarock deck is used in either complicated tricktaking games or solitarestyle games the tricktaking games are more common in richtcrag and vandregon while solitare games  as well as quite a bit of fortunetelling  became quite common in the maykar dominion where a number of richlydecorated decks found their origin few decks survived the trip over and the somewhat more intensive art that tradition indicates has led to a shortage which has likly added to their fabricated mystical origins each of the trumps is numbered from 021 expressing its relative value as compared to the other trumps in most games three trumps are seen as special  the i often called the magician is the weakest trump and is typically worth additional points in games due to the skill it takes to win a trick with it and displaying the typical richtcrag skepticism towards mystical might over the power of steel and the xxi known as the world is also worth additional points the 0trump called the fool is also known as an excuse  in most games it can never win a trick but instead excuses the player from participating in that trick and when it is played it is exchanged for a card of lesser value from the players alreadywon tricks tarocco the original richtcrag tricktaking game and the version that informs all of the variants known by players today it requires three to five players each player is dealt twelve cards and then the deck is set aside for that round of play the player to the right of the dealer starts the first trick and players must attempt to follow suit if a player cannot follow suit and they have one of the twentytwo trumps they must trump the play if a player cannot trump or follow suit then they may slough a card and cannot win that particular trick if a player has no cards of the original suit but does have at least two trumps if a trump has been played they must play a trump that beats the previous trump called overtrumping however here an element of the richtcrag honor asserts itself  if a player is found to have sloughed or undertrumped when they could have played a valid card and another player catches them they forefeit all points they would have won for that hand the 0trump acts as an excuse in this game and at the end of the hand all points are totalled rather than counting points for the number of tricks taken points are determined by the cards held by the player in the tricks they have collected with the following values the winner is of course the player with the most points at the end of a hand the game is typically gambled upon with each player staking an ante before any cards are dealt and the winner of a hand collecting all antes jeu de tarock a syndar variant of the above game it is decidedly more complicated and confusing for newer players to this deck it is played with between three to five players although four players is seen as the norm for the game and will be discussed in the play players first draw to determine who will deal first  the highest card wins with trumps beating suited cards and the fool discarded for a new draw the dealer then shuffles the deck which is then cut by the player on their left before dealing out eighteen cards to each player in packets of three additionally the dealer deals one at a time six cards into a pile known as the dog  one stipulation of the dealing is that two cards may not be dealt into the dog in a row nor may it receive the first or last card in the deal misdealing results in a penalty for the dealer  the hand is discarded and the deck reshuffled upon drawing their hands players must then bid on them declaring a contract both points and bid type that they feel they can meet with that hand starting to the dealers right each subsquent player may then pass or bid higher  a player who has passed cannot rejoin the bidding the highest bid  as in the final player to have a bid after all other players have passed  is then on the attack and the other players form the defense attempting to prevent them from meeting their contract the possible contracts and their method of play are from lowest to highest play procedes as normal in tricktaking games the final score is calculated by pairing cards according to the following score rubric when scoring the winning side determines their score by the following 25 plus any points above the contract or below in the case it was not met plus an additional 10 points if the final trick is taken by the i of trumps by the attacker is the base score in the case where the final trick is taken by the defense with the i of trumps 10 is instead subtracted from the base score this is then multiplied by the attackers hand bid and two additional bonuses may be added  first is the poigne where a player declares whether they have 10 13 or 15 trumps in their hand each of which adds 20 40 or 60 points to the final score respectively the second bonus is called the chelem  when declared the attacker is confident that they will take every trick in the round and will add 400 points if that is met but will lose 200 if they fail to meet it otherwise should either side take every trick without announcing they win 200 additional points should the attacker win then all players on the defense subtract the final hand score of the attacker from their points and the attacker gains all the points subtracted should the defense win then the attacker subtracts three times the final hand value from their score and the defense gains the hand value all scores should sum to zero at the end of each round as one might expect this is an incredibly challenging variant as befits the syndar love of complicated unnecessarily one might say games gambling is rarely used for jeu de tarock  in part due to the complicated methods of scoring two variants are written of however  in the first players each wager an agreedupon amount to form a pot with the winner taking the entire pot after an agreedupon number of hands typically four with deal passing to each player although longer games are not unheard of the second is for the truly dedicated gambler  players win or lose the total amount of coin equal to their final score the debts possible for this are truly staggering  records indicate that the somewhat notorious gambler sir madrienne lost a total of three thousand silver on a single game although the later arrest of his three partners for robbing a caravan on the aldorian border suggests that foul play may have been involved in this loss games of casting dice dice have existed in one form or another since the dawn of civilization in earlier days dice were made from the knucklebones of sheep and possessed only four faces due to their peculiar shapes as time went on dice were refined into the modern form we are familiar with  six sides each marked with painted or carved pips and used in various games of chance all over the continent if one were to divide games by region the aldorian love of dicing would be of special note although the nara pentare are also known to have several gambling games built around the dice surprisingly enough of the nonhuman races the ulven have taken the quickest to games of dice utilizing the knucklebones of their livestock to gamble in deference to their unfamiliarity with coinage and the civilized worlds sense of debts the dice are often used to gamble for drink with the loser taking drinks and all parties typically ending up roaring drunk by the end hazard one of the most famous aldorian gambling games it is played in two variants  twodie hazard and threedie hazard likely originating from bored sailors waiting on the docks hazard takes similar forms no matter the variant to begin the game one player acts as the bank offering to cover all bets made against them the bank is typically rotated throughout a game especially if one player finds themselves ruined by fortune during a game any other number of players may take part althogh only a single player rolls the dice at a time i will discuss the twodie variant first although the only change with the threedie variant is the odds of each roll to begin a shooter is chosen they place their stake wagering that they will win by throwing a number between 5 and 9 all other players wager whether the shooter will win or lose the shooter then throws  depending on their chosen number the number showing on the dice has a different effect if a number does not appear as either win or lose it becomes the new target number  called the chance  and the original number that they chose if rolled is now their losing number at this point the shooter may choose to keep their original stake or add to their stake if they are confident in their new number side bets may be altered as well odds for each chance pay out differently depending on the originallychosen number  typically related to their probabilites on the dice themselves rather than going through the entire listing i entail players to find a skilled hazard shooter to explain the odds there exist some cloth hazard mats typically sewn by aldorian sailors out of tattered sailcloth with the odds embroidered in them  they also serve to make betting considerably easier as players merely place their stake on the chosen numbers glckhaus another aldorian dicing game this gained prominence due to the somewhat more relaxed nature compared to hazard a favorite amongst a number of the ulven  especially when playing for drinks  the game is relatively simple so long as one has the necessary board and a pair of dice the game is played with any number of players as well as a board marked with spaces from 212 omitting four at the start of the game each player places a coin stake on the 7 square for the following rounds players roll the die taking a coin if they roll a space with a coin already on it and leaving a coin if they roll an empty space there are also three special spaces after a player rolls they pass the dice off to the next player  this can be either from the right or the left depending on the group one is gambling with a rollof four is always a pass  one loses nothing but one gains nothing either depending on cultural or personal preference the motifs and names of the spaces may change the richtcrag for example call the 2 space the mercenary and the 12 space the commander although other names are also certainly possible depending on the preference still this is primarily a social gambling game intended to be played while all involved are imbibing some form of alcohol ship captain and crew one of the most popular aldorian dicing games this is commonly played aboard ships and port bars  unlike many dicing games it requires both luck and judgment in equal measure to win it is also played casually without a stake  some find the rattling of the dice soothing and its a common sight in aldorian watering holes to find a few friends crowded around a table downing drinks and rattling the bones to play five dice are required as well as a suitable pot for the ante and a method of keeping score  many taverns have slate boards in them for just this purpose the players arrange themselves in a circle and then play begins the first player takes the five dice and rolls them each player is required to roll a 6 the ship 5 the captain and 4 the crew in three rolls if a player wishes to keep any of his dice unrolled they may only save in descending order  therefore a player who rolls 5 5 4 3 1 may not keep any dice while a player who rolls 6 4 3 3 3 may only keep the six  one requires a ship before they can hire a captain and a captain before a crew can be hired a player must reroll all dice that are not already set aside the remaining two dice are the ships cargo  add their value together if you manage to roll a 6 5 and 4 during that round a player may only choose to not reroll the cargo dice if they already have the required numbers showing on their dice if a player fails to roll a 6 5 and 4 after three throws they earn no points for that round and the dice are passed play procedes around the table with the highestscoring player winning that round in an anted game all players pay into the pot before the round begins and the winner is the one with the highest score during a round should two players tie for the highest score the pot is split evenly between them  in the case of an odd number of players a single coin remains in the pot for the beginning of the next round certain regions have their own variants on the rules  one such variation called caravan involves the players racing to reach an agreedupon point value typically the chosen value is 77  in part due to an older rule that players may not bank the same value twice there are also several variants that give additional values and penalties to certain rolls a relatively simple game this has rather enduring popularity in aldoriaa brief treatise on the mushrooms and toadcaps of faedrun and mardrun by thomas n schweinitz the role of mushrooms in the culture and cuisine of peoples across the lands cannot be understated it seems to be a commonality amongst the syndar ulven and human populations that these small plants serve as a staple foodstuff and ritual ingredient for reasons to be expounded on later to this end i have been commissioned to perform a complete survey of all surviving texts folk knowledge and ritual usage of these curious objects on the mysteries of mushroom growth  at the moment no known method exists for the organized cultivation of mushrooms despite their similarities in edibility to plants different scholars have contributed their own knowledge to the problem generally disagreeing on the exact nature of the species de haverland of vandregon in the scroll in augmentum et plantatio fungos postulates that the flowering caps of mushrooms are formed on magicallyactive sites  places of natural mana on the other hand the seminal      by the syndar scholar laitenea areasin disagrees with this pointing to mushrooms as an intermediate step between plants and animals citing their tendency towards accelerated growth in decaying matter and the existence of a wispy fragmented root system a hybrid explanation is thus adapted from these  the following assumptions are made as to the nature of mushrooms these assumptions therefore allow for a new formulation of the mushrooms existence  suitable spots must be located before cultivation is attempted as there is no known reliable way to determine whether or not the background mana is of sufficient quantity and purity to allow this plant to exist as for the success of attempts to cultivate mushrooms on a larger scale it can only be assumed that some fluke of background mana has allowed the success of that particular growth their behaviour and growth patterns therefore lend themselves much more to the passive gathering of these plants rather than active cultivation on the four natures and five shapes of mushrooms  as the mushroom is a hybrid plant it therefore must bear a specific nature in order to prove useful to an intelligent species as such we may return to blackwells animantibus natura which divides the natural realm into the following categories carniverous herbacious omniferous passive active and reactive these categories form the basis for all classifications of nonthinking living matter  as mushrooms are hybrids then the following natures are apparent these four natures neatly encapsulate every variety of mushroom found across the face of faedrun and mardrun and so seem to be the most useful classification method the transformation of mushrooms from one category to another is possible but requires knowledge of the specific methods of treatment required to shift the internal mana holding these plants together into a form more agreeable with that of the consumer in addition mushrooms are identified by one of five shapes each of which tends to fall into its own categorythrand squinted as he looked up at the clear blue sky he was lying on his back and his head hurt fresh blood trickled down his lip where a shield edge

the harsh beating he had just given thrand bryech was younger but strong and spirited he made a good pack longfang warrior he would make a fine ulfednar some day part of thrand wished he wouldnt make it look so easy when he pummeled him during weapons training but he knew to voice it or even believe in such things would dishonor him would a grimward warrior or a whiteoak berserker be any less savage in battle thrand wiped the blood off of his chin and picked up his sword and shield preparing himself for another beating he clanked the weapon to the shield edge audibly two times again the blade whipped through the air heading straight for thrand its path was deceptive enough to be hard to follow but thrands eyes were trained enough to understand where it was going but the weight of the shield was too much for him to react quickly and he felt sluggish try as he might there was nothing he could do he was just simply too slow too clumsy to block it with a painful slap the flat of frithas blade swatted thrand across his bottom the sting and the smart of the pain enough to force thrand to suck in air through gritted teeth flat or not it was still a couple pounds of steel hitting him with sufficient force how exactly did you become so much better at this than i asked thrand grumpily as he rubbed the pain out of his left buttock my father taught me and i paid attention to fighting with a sword and shield i think some of the pups in the village can use a shield better than you replied fritha in a matteroffact voice with a hint of playfulness although her duties as a daughter of gaia in the onsallas village kept her busy fritha continued to train as a warrior she excelled at sword and shield combat and could best thrand most of the time yeah well i can still

thrand was both amused and not at the same time and halfplayfully glared at her again thrand was soaked in sweat wearing a padded gambeson with bits of leather over it hours of fighting in the damp conditions of the swamp had left him tired he was used to cloaks hoods and lighter wool tunics not constricting and hot garments for close quarter battle his limbs felt heavy he was out of arrows and throwing knives the whiteoak warrior standing before him had a shield he stood poised and ready to strike stoic and waiting for thrands advance although thrands skill with a shield was improving he did not have one to protect him during this fight he did however hold a long two handed axe in both hands and if there was something that thrand was good at it was handling an ax and splitting fire wood with a roar thrand leapt towards the whiteoak warrior planting his feet and winding up the axe it generated immense force as it spun around and shattered the warriors shield splinters exploded from the now useless shield and before the whiteoak warrior had time to react thrand spun and followed up the heavy strike with two smaller ones aimed at the whiteoaks midsection the axe bit deep in each side but yet the warrior remained standing with a second roar of exertion thrand arced the axe in a large sweep winding up and with precision and strength landed the axe blade directly on top of the whiteoaks head the blade bit deep cutting the whiteoak warrior in two thrand youve been at this all day you should take a rest said stanrick from somewhere nearby his words were both an approval that stopping would not be looked down on yet there was also a challenging edge to it thrand snapped out of his mental battlefield the two bloody halves of a whiteoak warrior were in fact the two halves of a sturdy log that he had just split the shield a simple piece of wood cobbled together to be used in training breathing hard with exertion thrands mind raced he still to this day felt shame for being so far away from the battles in clan stormjarl territory to hear reports of how his new pack was fighting to save his old clan cut him deeply making him feel helpless and useless out near the dirge swamp he was not skirting his duties or avoiding the battle he was just needed elsewhere thrand looked up at stanrick and met his gaze again as the stormjarl recruits braced for impact and the lines crashed into each other some of them were jostled hard and fell to the ground hours of intense training had worn them out and made them clumsy their mock shield wall broke and crumbled the warriors too exhausted to continue on orrin azra and bryech all pushed easily through their line even though the recruits outnumbered them three to one with wooden swords or padded sticks they thumped the recruits painfully teaching them a lesson thrand stood beside the line and watched he was analyzing the fight and how the two sides met how an archer could support them or how a long weapon like a large axe could be used to break the other lines shield wall he had spent time learning from some of the human and syndar warriors how they fought in combat and dealt with war with a few groans of pain and exhaustion the stormjarl recruits stood up and stumbled back into a line a sudden aroma wafted across the training grounds right outside the palisade walls of the onsallas outpost food fresh hot delicious food food that the recruits were starving for food that fritha and reyna had been preparing that afternoon delicious spices savory meat fresh warm bread and butter mixed with bee honey some of the recruits looked longingly at thrand silently pleading to have him stop the training so that they may rest and eat almost comically on cue one of the warriors stomachs growled audibly during the few seconds of respite he too was hungry deprived of food and training most of the day his mind thought of how hungry the defenders of the battle of blackwolf creek must have been as the grimward line pressed on them for months and finally charged into a bloody melee fresh and hot meals would be a luxury once the raids began and the longfangs joined clan axhound in their attacks on clan whiteoak with the raids on their mutual enemy approaching the intensity of the training had picked up for the new recruits thrands face was expressionless as his eyes scanned from warrior to

onsallas village and kept the darkness at bay a few campfires illuminated some makeshift tents and dwellings recently added to the village by the clan stormjarl refugees who had traveled to the edge of the world to scratch out a living walking past them and nodding a few greetings thrand and fritha walked towards the massive wooden doors of the great hall standing ever vigilant in full mail plated leather and helms were some of the honor guards of pack longfang hulking warriors who are hand selected from the warriors of the pack pledged with the safety of the packs daughters and leadership they took their job very seriously they sized up both thrand and fritha even though they had both been seen a thousand times in the village greetings hakon said fritha as she walked up the steps towards the wooden door thrand followed closely behind neither of them had any reason to be nervous or tense but being close to the honor guard sometimes rattled people they were very intense had little in the way of humor and were quick to anger the rest are inside they just arrived said hakon through large fangs his deep voice matching his massive physical stature the two guards stepped back from the door and remained at their post thrand walked past them with a nod and pushed open the massive wooden door in the center of the room stood a collection of pack longfang members and veterans during other meetings some guests or friends of the clan like selena stargazer of clan spiritclaw would have been permitted to join rill had insisted that this meeting be composed only of those members of the pack thrand spoke to the assembled members as he took up a position near a large table in the center of the hall behind the table was the enclosed canopy where the runeseer used to sit it stood eerily vacant sorry we are late fritha and i checked on the wounded stormjarls that traveled to us recently it seems that they will be all right and are grateful for the aid we gave them everyone knows why we are here tonight let every member of this packs voice be heard if you wish it to be who wants to begin ill start off with this bryech said so far without any central leadership weve done well as a pack our new recruits are training and are learning what it means to be a longfang weve all worked together to make sure the village is maintained and our supplies at stable amounts however that wont last we need central leadership he leaned forward in his seat and clasped his hands in front of him the obvious choice would be to name a chieftain as most other packs then again we arent most packs pausing he looked around at his assembled pack the choice is not limited only to a chieftain though there are many paths we could choose bryech leaned back in his chair and waited for a response knowing he restated the obvious though he didnt care he felt that this very delicate matter should be handled with the utmost importance and understanding possible reynas face was serious as she listened to bryech speak when he was finished she rose to her feet and began we may not be most packs but we are longfang change is one of the businesses we have long dealt with already we have few if any of our representatives alongside the leaders of any clan in that withdrawal our former place of honor has been forfeit she let the gravity of these words sink in war ravages our land and we remain powerless in every moot denigrated as a mere pack and only through the respect earned by individuals is the longfang voice heard anywhere i say we cease hesitating and cleave to the heart of the matter none among the daughters hear the voices of the runes as soulveig did if we walk the path we are on any longer it will be without the signs to guide us clearly she settled herself back into her place smoothing her skirts as she sat stanrick shifted in his seat yes these are all things we know im sure by now we have all read the letter or had it read to us we as longfangs have choices to make and till now we have not had to make any like this soulveig made choices for us and we did as we were told maybe we were spoiled i will be honest i didnt know what to do when she gave me a choice but now we all need to make one so what are we waiting for we want to be respected by the clans then we need a chieftain with that he began to stuff his pipe and looked around the room to see who would speak next bryech smirked and chuckled you think just having a chieftain earns a pack respect bryech asked and shook his head still chuckling we are a pack known for our warriors and for that we are respected and have a great honor at least most of us do leaning forward and clasping his hands in front of him he continued a chieftain is one option yes but we like i already said arent most packs so why should we do as they do bryech looked around the room at all the people he has grown close to and been proud to call his friends we all have a very different view of the world we should utilize this finished with his response bryech leaned back in his seat no just having a chieftain does not earn respect but when an ulven asks who leads pack longfang if we say anything other then the name of our chieftain they wont listen to what we have to say that is the way packs work even the way we were we had one person in charge every pack works this way even packs that are not just any pack or are you suggesting we become like humans and make councils and sit and debate whose turn it is to go use the latrine stanrick smirked we have been running this pack by committee since soulveig passed and what did that do we spent almost an hour in debate while whiteoak attacked a caravan with children we all are guilty of this we are very set in our ways but now this changes we need a chieftain to take charge and a priestess to lead us on gaias path whiteoak and grimward know we are weak now they know we no longer have the runeseer to guide us we were not ready for this so we scramble like rabbits running from a fox can a pack of wolves last without an alpha no they fight among themselves and get overtaken by stronger packs he paused and took a deep breath what most do not see is that every chieftain and clanleader keeps a group of elders to advise them we dont have elders i myself am now the oldest in this pack and this is my 39th summer yes we do have a different view of the world we see things other packs and clans do not we are not bound by what our clan tells us we see things in a light that others cannot this comes from whom we were we got to see how every clan handles politics how many times has a clanleader asked their longfang honor guard for their input it happens more then one might think our best option is to pick a chieftain then advisers i propose a warrior a hunter a daughter and someone to advise on the village and outpost one chieftain and four advisers this will give whomever we pick better tools to do this task as for whom well weve never had a chieftain so its not like we have been grooming a replacement bryech is a strong warrior he understands war more so then most his age he speaks well i think he would be a good choice for the warrior to advise the chieftain i myself have been traveling a lot lately and i find myself speaking on behalf of the pack last fall soulveig gave me a choice and i made it he stood up and looked bryech in the eyes i did not go with you and my brothers to stormjarl i took a different path you and i both know gaia weeps at the death of her children by the hands of their brothers i chose to go with the truthseeker in hopes that she could find out why grimward would attack ulven march to war and kill their own kind while mordok run unchecked i did not see my brothers fall i will live with this till i face the great wolf but i made the choice because i knew that if we are to survive we need to have allies not one of us is ready for change but change does not care if we are ready bryech you talked to me after we removed the last of the whiteoak raiders from our lands will you support me as chieftain will you help me return your pack my pack our pack to a place of honor and respect that the name longfang demands the problem with that stanrick is exactly that looking back at stanrick bryech mustered all of his hatred and anger into his eyes and let his rage flow forth you ask me to support your claim as chieftain but you show no attempt or even a willingness to put your duty first bryech could feel his voice rising with anger as his words echoed off the wall of the great hall you have shamed yourself stanrick longfang bryech shouted standing up and extending his right arm in front of himself to point at stanrick you abandoned your duty so you could have your prize you were not there when honor and duty called you werent there to hold those dying men and women and hear them utter their last words or the names of mates and pups as they faded to the hunting grounds or choked on their own blood we ate iron rations of food if any at all and froze nearly to death fulfilling our duty to clan stormjarl while you kept yourself safe and warm with the thighs of your mate far away from battle you left your brothers and sisters in honor to face the wrath of many and fight against the tyranny of clan grimward and their allies bryech was roaring now but did not let anyone stop him until he was finished he could feel the fire burn inside of him which turned him into an inferno the redhot glow burned through his eyes and showed his rage and savagery in its fullest you claim to understand your actions but you do not bryech continued you ask me to support you as chieftain when you have proven yourself unworthy of the honor of leading this pack bryech yelled amazed at the fact that he had kept up this long and glad he wasnt finished i told you i supported you i didnt mean as a chieftain bryech said looking stanrick in the eyes i support you as my brother in honor so that you can right your wrongs bryech said never breaking eye contact with stanrick this pack needs a leader or at least leaders who know that duty comes first his voice calmed as he looked at his assembled pack mates we have a choice to make we can bend to the will of outsiders and base our actions on gaining their favor or we can do what is best for our pack and let the opinions of other packs be only that opinions bryech said as he sat down still feeling his rage simmering inside of him stanrick grinned now the truth had come out honor and duty tell me bryech how does it feel to know you have gone back on your word you said you would support me as chieftain your words not mine yet now you change what you said so did you lie to me before or are you lying now i stand by my choice there is no disrespect in my path whether you agree to it or not he got up then raised his voice but you have gone back on your word as ulven we have two things we are accountable for the actions we take and the words we speak now you toss your word to the wind you lie and for what were you hoping that if you said you would support me i would do you a favor he calmed a bit then continued it was not just i who heard your words the great wolf knows the truth so lie but we all know that the great wolf does not look on those who lie to their brothers with kindness my choice was still was an honorable one my name will be heard but i will not let a pup lie to my face i see i was wrong about saying you were ready to lead such manipulation is the kind of dishonorable act i expect from a whiteoak not a longfang warrior bryech jumped to his feet with rage in his eyes to be called dishonorable by stanrick after it was bryech who called out his lacking presence during the combat were dangerous words indeed honor duels were started over less warriors were broken over the violence that could be dealt in defense of ones honor the gathered pack members quickly glanced at each other wondering if someone should try to stop this confrontation or let it unfold even stanrick flinched as he realized how deep his words had probably cut bryech and he wondered if it was wise to speak them or if he was prepared for the beating that bryech could potentially give him the warrior was young but full of energy and was already scarred more so than some of the veteran warriors enraged like this he would be a very dangerous opponent there was a brief hesitation by the group and it seemed like an eternity as everyone waited for the tension to boil over as both byrech and stanrick glowered at each other with rage in their eyes ranmir leaned forward please brothers sit down i know that i have been away for a long time he said softly i know that many of you do not know me i do not truly know myself anymore i know that as such my voice may not be taken with as much weight as those who have been here for recent events i know that my area of knowledge the swamp and its inhabitants are not much assistance in this conversation i also know that some may see stanrick as having shied from his duty as a warrior but a warriors duty is not always fighting a fight head on in fact those who lead warriors sometimes must instead try to find a way for the fighting to stop there is a saying among the longfang pack that we all know well a longfang who goes grey is a longfang who held back i invite you to think on this for a moment ranmir paused to scan the room this saying has often been taken to mean that it is a bad thing for a longfang to go grey that to die in battle is the greatest honor of all and one should strive to do this before he or she grows old for many years i lived by the letter of this phrase but i have lived it under a different understanding the way i see it the way i believe we all should see it if we are to continue as a pack he paused yet again to look at bryech no truly as a family we need to know our own limitations it does not serve this pack this family to die a death that has no true meaning the pack was honor bound to provide support and warriors no individuals were specifically called by name this has been told to me we must all know our limits and only when absolutely necessary push ourselves beyond them many warriors went to stormjarl to defend them stanrick went a different route to attempt to find a solution that would have saved more lives rather than shed more blood and you fault him for this i feel this is a strength not a weakness there is a reason we have no elders and i feel it is a poor one finished ranmir stanrick did find a solution that will save lives reyna leaned forward her elbows on the table we have vandregon here because of his negotiations while we scramble to train up more warriors to defend our borders the allies stanrick found patrol our borders and listen in silence to respect the fallen whose tracks they walk in is not the one who thinks to the future the proper choice to lead us forward azra stood there crossed armed and with a scowl on her face it had become apparent that she had something she wanted to say after bryech had said his piece and called stanrick out others had spoken first and she tried to wait patiently her impatience and scowl growing larger by the moment finally she could wait no longer why would we vote you for chieftain stanrick what have you actually done for our pack nothing youve done nothing except sit and drink while your pack mates were out there fighting for their lives honoring a debt to stormjarl you chose to be selenas escort but it had nothing to do with being honorable and protecting her as bryech already said all it had to do with was that you wanted to lay with her you accomplished your goal but what you didnt accomplish was any good for the pack you say you tried to make allies with the other clans at the dinner in the winter but you obviously didnt try very hard just because someone was busy at the time that you decided it was convenient for you to talk to them does not mean that there was no chance of them becoming our allies if you just tried to work with them more i heard the stories about you sitting around and telling jokes and drinking with some of the watchwolves how is that proof that you were looking out for our pack if we need a chieftain then it needs to be someone who has actually done something for the pack which you have not we have always lived under the guidance of a priestess a runeseer and i see no reason why we need to change now and i swear to the great wolf stanrick longfang that if you try to wound my honor with twisted words i will break your jaw and make you to choke on your own blood barked azra in anger as she stepped in dangerously close and glared at him her words cut stanrick and her demeanor and stance dared him to confront her about it after weathering bryechs attack on his honor stanrick was further angered by azras response rage filled his features and he stood up to her and snarled replying with anger in his voice azra refused to back down snarling back at him and replying in kind bryech was also caught up in the tension and the three warriors started trying to snarl and talk over each other mere inches separated azra and stanrick and the three warriors degraded into a chaotic mess of harsh words and verbal fighting stanrick was taking the brunt of months of repressed anger from the warriors who survived the battle of blackwolf creek and it was a miracle that fists hadnt been thrown or weapons unsheathed some of the other longfang members tried to chime in and ease the tension and all it did was add to the chaos thrand had listened in and now was trying to calm the warriors down to no avail he glanced to his side and watched as fritha sighed and walked forwards she made no attempt to add to the discussion and instead walked straight towards the three warriors somehow she had managed to walk in between azra and stanrick calmly placing herself in between them in the confusion the two of them stopped and were gently yet assertively forced backwards when fritha raised her arms and parted between them caught off guard they stopped their bickering and eased back for a moment the rest of the room fell silent which gave her a chance to control what was happening that is enough peace brothers and sisters we are here to discuss the future of our pack not squabble among ourselves and fight like pups over who is leading a game fritha said in a calm voice as she looked around her but there was an edge of authority that was impossible to ignore this is our future our packs future we need to make plans and build not argue and get nowhere after this last battle look around this room our numbers are small and without a leader to speak for us we will surely become smaller you are all correct in your own way bryech we are known for being warriors and protecting the land that will not change whatever the conversation was between you two there seems to have been a misunderstanding yes stanrick chose a different path than his battle brothers and sisters but he wasnt the only one who stayed we all wanted to go into battle and yet some stayed all for different reasons we all must bear that burden now knowing that if we went maybe we could have made a difference ranmir you said that a warriors duty is not always fighting a battle head on just like the outpost we need our warriors and guards but we also need people who dont fight so the outpost is taken care of this is the same for a pack reyna you speak true when you say we need a leader we do we listened to soulveig now that she is gone the world could view us as a group of pups without a leader even azra is correct stanrick has made choices in his life where the pack was not in the front of his mind those assembled respected frithas words and the tension eased down fritha looked around at the small gathering of her pack so few she thought we have fought so hard pride rested in her heart to be able to be among them to be part of them even if it was by being honor bound but they have been reduced in numbers so greatly as she continued to look around the room she was forced to face the fact that no one had her trust to be a leader stanrick was the closest but he has a long way to go she heard the stories of the dinner where he was sent to talk to allies he held respect but did not use it to his fullest bryech so strong but so full of anger thrand smart as he is he lacks the confidence he feels he is not the fighter to represent pack longfang ranmir newly brought back to the pack she knew he was not ready orrin very bright and has already seen so much fighting he was too young azra very much like bryech she is best suited for fighting rill reyna and fritha were all willing to step up if the pack needed them but prefer tending to the spiritual needs of the pack she sighed there really was only one choice if they wanted a leader our numbers are few and they will stay this way until we get back onto our feet if we were being honest i would say that no one is exactly qualified to lead us but one thing is clear we do need a leader ulven are born with no knowledge it comes from learning and i have watched stanrick learn and change from the warrior i met years ago he is learning she looked at stanrick stanrick longfang i will back you i will back you because i know you do not take this on lightly and will do your best i will offer my counsel to you at any time but be warned i am also here to protect the pack and i will be keeping an eye on you you will learn and you will be the leader i expect you to be or you will answer to me listen to gaia and keep her in your heart always she looked around the room nodding her head to everyone thank you she turned and took her seat next to thrand rill took the opportunity to speak as well now that the hostility had eased down i have been training beside the runeseer for many years and i knew her probably better than all of you her passing was sudden and her words were cryptic more so than before i believe that her intention was to force us to truly think about the future and decide as a pack how to move on i have tried but the runes do not speak to me like they did to her we cannot replace the runeseer with another as azra stated because there is nobody with that talent at least not at this time i agree that we need to choose a leader we are strong as a pack when we have a strong leader i do not agree with stanrick that the chieftain should lead alone we should also name a priestess i volunteer for this position as i have the most experience in the daytoday affairs of the settlement and have worked closest with the runeseer before her passing i am also usually the one that handles the rituals and cleansing of whatever random things that the rest of you bring home from the outsiders or the swamp itself thrand had time to really think things through and analyze his thoughts on the current situation he felt it was his time to speak as all of you know fritha and i joined pack longfang by being honor bound from our home of clan stormjarl we have the benefit of knowing how other packs and clans work and how they can interact with each other if our pack wishes to be viewed with the honor and respect of a full pack then we must choose new leaders both a chieftain and a priestess most of the clanleaders are steeped in tradition and without those honored titles then we may never gain their respect i have dealt with a number of clans groups and factions we see a lot of supplies come and go from the outpost stanrick has been able to negotiate a number of deals for our pack get us allies when we needed them and acquire supplies or help find a way to transport goods i feel that my perspective is different than most of yours because of this i believe that stanrick does look out for the best interest of the pack and i support his bid to become our chieftain said thrand with a calm voice before anyone could add in thrand continued bryech and azra i respect the both of you not only because you are warriors of this pack but because you are veterans and know many things that i do not while i respect both of you i disagree with you both on your claims that stanrick was dishonorable i know that his decision to go with the truthseeker in her journey was one that broke some sort of warrior code that is silently agreed upon by all the warriors in this pack it is understandable that he will have to face this decision in a way that satisfies that code but i do not think that what it did for the pack can be overlooked no he was not there when the fighting got bad no he was not there when his battle brothers sacrificed their lives to save clan stormjarl if stanrick is to be judged harshly for this then i am to be judged as well my duty to this pack is to train gather supplies manage the outpost and make sure our warriors have what they need that is the way that i help support this pack but in doing so i had to sit idly by and hear reports of how clan grimward was ravaging my blood familys homeland and that the warriors of my new home my new pack and family are there defending them maybe i could have made a difference or maybe i would have just gotten myself killed the truth is that i was not there to fight alongside my pack the same as stanrick and if you wish to swear oaths of vengeance and call upon a duel of honor then you best include me as well thrand let the statement sink in for a moment he hoped that changing the focus away from just the warriors would help sometimes the other pack members forget that both thrand and fritha come from clan stormjarl and have blood ties to their previous families there this civil war has been hard on both of them so far removed from stormjarl territory after having joined pack longfang i will support you stanrick longfang in your journey to become chieftain of our pack i see in you a progressive leader one who understands the importance of every aspect of our pack from your time as a warrior a hunter a quartermaster a representative a leader and a father you have within you what this pack needs i understand some of the burden of what you are asking for it is not a mantle that i wish to wear but you have my support i agree with fritha that nobody is a perfect fit for this position and you have a long way to go but i do believe in you to help us regain our strength as a pack you have plans to build our pack larger to gain allies like the colonists and other clans like axhound and the watchwolves and to strike back against clan whiteoak and grimward for their transgressions i look forward to the day when pack longfang and its allies return and free stormjarl from grimward may his ears ring with your name ended thrand as he took a seat beside fritha bryech still felt his rage flooding over him and made no attempt to hide it in his features a perpetual snarl had taken over his face calling me out on my youth is one thing calling me a liar is another he said to stanrick through gritted teeth i told you i would support you if you showed me you were worthy and like i said you have failed to prove it to me leaning back in his seat again bryech continued i was never looking for a favor from you stanrick i was testing you and you have failed that test he looked to ranmir next and smiled ranmir youre right though our lack of elders is something we may come to regret i see no reason why it should as stanrick himself said i am young and yet i have an understanding of war most do not this proves that just because one is older it does not mean they are the most likely to possess the right answer bryech then looked to reyna reyna you have i feel a bit too much confidence in your cousin azra is right we all know that stanrick is once again going to be a father and who is the mother but the truthseeker selena i admit i have never been a man without faults i am just a man bryech sighed when we choose our leaders we need to make sure they are fit to lead thats all im saying bryech sat back in his chair and waited for the discussion to continue but by the great wolf he was tired of all this talking as some began to voice their support and others dissent ranmir decided to speak once again bryech my brother stated that you understand war better than most your age it seems your anger is filling your ears with what you wish to hear i believe thrand is right my brother is likely not ready to take the mantle of leadership alone however if you can show me someone who is ready i will hang my bow on the wall and give myself to the mordok but not as ranmir as brf for i feel the great wolf does not know that name rill has volunteered to take the role of priestess and while i do not know much in the ways of that my brother has already said that he would want advisers to assist him he has many qualities that will help to guide this pack in the right direction and i believe he can become the leader we need for this reason among many i will back stanrick longfang as chieftain if it is what the pack wills stanrick nodded to his brother then looked at bryech but chose not to get drawn into another argument on the issue he then looked to rill you are right i never intended to do this without a priestess you have the most training on the subject as we are you are the best for the task he looked to fritha i would expect nothing less from you then to keep a eye on me and trust you will give me your insight bryech looked at all of his assembled pack and felt his anger subside to pride at being a part of this family a family he felt had faced challenges that none other had faced before bryech stood up to speak his final piece it seems my words have made little difference not surprising bryech smiled and pulled his dagger from its sheathe on his belt thrand and orrin began to quickly rise from their seats fearing bryech doing something rash but stopped once bryech raised his left hand and motioned for them to sit bryech slammed his dagger into the table the blade sinking into the wood with a resounding crunch stanrick know all i have said is nothing but my feelings over your recent actions i hold no grudge against you any longer as for my support of your claim i say here for all to hear and know pausing so that the seriousness of his statement could sink in stanrick longfang you will receive my support in your pursuit of being the chieftain know that i dont do this lightly and i still think you have much to atone for but then again so do i the great wolf will judge us both eventually bryech began to walk toward the door but stopped when he reached stanrick and extended his arm in good faith hoping his friend would make the right choice i am a warrior not a chieftain my mind is that of a protector and fighter not a politician just know that if you do anything to endanger this pack you will have to answer to me still waiting for stanrick to decide how their friendship would continue stanrick sized up bryech then offered his arm in return i was not making up what i said you are a great and honorable warrior and even though we may not always agree we are family you are a longfang i know i have much to learn but i think we all do let us move forward to make our pack great again bryech laughed and slapped his friend on the shoulder and then walked out of the great hall i have to prepare for the coming actions our pack is taking with our axhound allies so i must excuse myself continuing his way toward the door and not turning around ill be back for the knife and may his ears ring with all our names bryech said as he opened the door and walked out hoping he had made the right choice azra audibly rolled her eyes from off to the side of the discussion still fuming in anger but keeping it in check and apparently a bit disappointed that the discussion didnt come to blows she seemed content with leaving the discussion unfinished between her and stanrick perhaps to make him always second guess his actions in the future she made no attempt to speak and give stanrick her support making it obvious to everyone that she opposed reynas hand had gone to her hilt when bryech had drawn steel she was struck hard by how dangerous bryech had become he seemed to have lost all but the ability to be on a battlefield and he claimed to know what was best for the pack instead of voicing her doubts however she released her swords hilt she knew it was already clear where her support lay but tradition required her to voice it in irrefutable terms stanricks claim has my support reyna spoke the words as bryech made his melodramatic exit orrin had quietly been watching the entire discussion from a seat at the table although a skilled warrior he was not prone to outbursts like bryech was he pushed back his chair and stood up stanrick i feel the choice you made to accompany selena was honorable although i would have better liked seeing you fight alongside harlok to see him when he met his end and started his journey you had a hard decision to make and i understand that with that being said i fully support you as chieftain orrin sat back down and looked around the room thank you orrin your words do me great honor replied stanrick stanrick went to the head of the table and took a moment to look at soulveigs empty chair the plush seating and drapings around her place of honor were vacant and ominous he then turned to face the rest of the pack the room felt so empty only a few warriors still remained pups had no voice till they had proven their place and a number of hunters and daughters had fallen over the winter he knew that the path gaia put before them was going to be hard he stood tall next to the empty chair if this is what the pack wills i stanrick longfang son of dennagrath and yoreden longfang accept the weight and responsibility of the title of chieftain so that our pack may grow and we as a people can warden the great wolfs will as we walk down gaias path together he stood waiting for any one else to say their peace and was met with silencebannica yulrude sat near the candlelight and brought his quill to the parchment laid before him finally committing to written word the thoughts and feelings in him about his faith and how his diety has revealed herself to him was both enlightening and terrifying to him year 263 the revelations of shepard bannica yulrude all my life i have served the mother but never once did i consider i might become such a direct instrument of her will i certainly never believed id commune with her directly through a mordok shrine but i suppose the details of how this came to be are irrelevent what matters is that i continue my work as i always have and share my revelations as promised i realize now you cannot defeat or defy a god only accept it for what it truly is the mordok shrines are seen as a place of corruption but this is not true in fact a delicate balance is at work there is no corruption only decay and rebirth the daughters of gaeas cleansing rituals merely represent an opposing force in its extreme they are no more helping mardrun then saving a burning man by drowning him would you starve a forest of its natural order would you have the leaves never fall so that when spring came no new life could sprout from the rot suffering is a necessity one must consume to survive and they must in turn offer their own life to decay so life may begin anew this debt cannot be denied and it can no longer be ignored the red eyed syndar spoke of a great danger to the land one the mordok seek to overcome though ive seen it with my own eyes it somehow escapes recollection it remains the companion of the mother and the charge of her mordok children together they lurk ever present in the corner of my eye the answers i seek are presented as visions whispering to me in a strange language waiting for me to understand waiting for me to share though the road i resolve to walk appears dark i must remain resolute to the vows ive made as a shepard of her will the heralds of change have arrived and i will do as asked i will teach  among the wreckage of their caravan elder luisa barros of devas will barely clung life an open chest wound promised a slow and agonizing death she was a healer and though she had treated many wounds like this one the mordok had left her arms crippled and her talents useless she had made her way near onsallas to retrieve an injured subordinate when the merchants she thought herself lucky to travel with were hit now in the carnage she couldnt help but see the situations many ironies fading in and out of consciousness she began to recite one last prayer accepting her fate only it was not to be an unexpected sight brought her attention back to the world of the living the mordok had vanished back into the swamp and a human man clad in black with a headdress of feathers skulked out of the woods behind them the stranger danced among the bodies speaking in a strange tongues to an unseen figure and stopping often at corpses kneeling beside them and placing his hand above their head it looked as though he was struggling with channeling magic of the divine trying to speak with the dead but he asked no questions instead he stroked their brow and spoke as if to reassure them marking them in blood before moving on he sought no answers this was a ceremony to him the man in black worked his way closer stopping often to perform these bizarre rites though he made no sign of noticing the survivor he seemed quite deliberate when he suddenly turned and knelt beside elder barros only then through blurred vision did the dying servant of devas will realize this was shepard yulrude the wounded subordinate she had come to retrieve she tried to force out words to exclaim her surprise but her throat produced only blood in response yulrude placed a hand on the wound and began to recite a healing incantation only the words of faith had changed and the magic wavered leaning close he began to whisper the mother has shown me your face in visions i do not know why you were chosen but i believe i am here to save you no she managed to gurgle out struggling beneath the very hand which preserved her life the man of once impeccable honor now reeked with an aura of corruption it was palpable she would have no part in whatever darkness infected him yulrude contemplated her reaction this woman would rather die than challenge her own beliefs truly the minds of human and ulven alike were warped and deceived they had been blinded by faith and lies and would only suffer as a result elder barros spat blood and fought but yulrude persisted he would not leave her to die finally in desperation she pulled a dagger from his belt and tried to drive it into his side it was at that moment yulrudes spell took on a will of its own the lifepreserving magic became like poison and elder barros began to convulse violently dropping the dagger her wound festered and corruption seeped in rotting her body from the inside and bringing a gruesome end to her life yulrude pulled away in horror but his remorse quickly vanished at sight of the dagger only then did he realize the mother had never intended him to save her life apologies elder it appears i misunderstood her screams in the distance suggested the mordok had found more victims near onsallas outpost it was time to speak to reyna longfang in person and now he made haste towards his destination fearing she would need his help with the survivors as yulrude walked off in haste to whatever purpose his mind had been set to across the way a figure with blood red eyes had been silently watching  it wasnt supposed to be like this yulrude was so confused the torment of his faith and the immense loss of blood were making it hard to think he could feel her the mother the presence that he had built his spiritual fortress around her presence was pleading resistant to what was happening recently it had been supressed but now it was strong now it forced its way back to him frantically it tugged on his faith and pulled at him but yulrude would not budge suddenly with a jolt she was gone yulrude was alone his faith was shattered he could see the ulven and the others the ones that stopped the ritual he saw mad morty crawling beside him as a sword was impaled into him and morty stopped crawling away yulrude could feel his life blood flow from his body as thrand was screaming at him thrand had stepped into the corruption site to stop him he couldnt hear what the ulven was saying his eyesight was fading his faith was a vessel void and emptied and he started to feel remorse for his actions the presence crept back to him it was pleased grinning at him as his heart beat its last and final beat  with a gasp of sucking breath yulrude shot back to the realm of the living choking and hacking his body regained life and stepped away from the cusp of death the world was spinning and he was sick vertigo tearing at him from every direction suddenly a familiar presence poured itself into the spiritual vessel that was the core of yulrudes being what was once conflicted and then emptied was not filled with affection and purpose yulrude wretched and vomited on the ground and though the world was spinning around him he noticed he was surrounded by figures encircling yulrude were half a dozen mordok and a tribal helmed syndar you have learned well said the syndar as he gazed upon yulrude with blood red eyes  endhes dead thats what the man said momma started weeping he came over and handed me dads sword he said your father fought bravely son he died with honor he died the man said it so calmly i dont understand its been 3 days since that man was here mommas just been drinking and crying i told momma i was hungry but she just looked right through me momma please i said she saw me this time her face twisted she got angry and shouted go away and slapped my face im sorry momma i thought as i went to my bed and lay down go away youre just a burden she shouted as she struck me again i fell down im sorry momma i just wanted to help she sat down and started to drink and sob you look just like your father by the gods why do you have to look like your father i was slinking back to bed why does it matter if i look like daddy its not my fault im sorry momma i didnt mean to upset you again i thought as i drifted into troubled sleep momma momma look i shouted holding up the bread and meat the butcher had given me he said he heard about daddy and that i could work sweeping his shop for some food momma just got mad again she swatted the food out of my hands and hit me again why couldnt you get more booze something good were almost out of it i felt the tears burning my eyes oh youre crying now not when you find out your father died but when i yell at you she kicked me on the floor im sorry momma im sorry ill do better get out she cried i ran from the house i ran far away i dont remember how long i ran but it was night before i stopped i was on the edge of vandregon land i found an alley to sleep in that night i wept again it was cold i was hungry i had a fitful nights sleep i woke with the sun i decided to leave the kingdom i wanted away from her and their memories i fought the tears for so long but it was futile and the tears came i wept and i walked it was night again before i stopped walking i had just reached our neighboring kingdom i recognized the colors blue and green i slept in another alley more hunger and another fitful night i woke with the sun again i still felt too close i walked again i walked until i reached the coast i needed food i begged and begged different shops to let me work for food when finally an old man said he would feed me if i would help him unload some shipping vessels i eagerly agreed i worked with him for several years it was the week after my tenth birthday a ship pulled into the docks i had seen it a couple times before but usually when it docked my master told me to go inside but this time he told me to stay i saw a man get off the ship with such an air about him that only meant he must have been the captain no one on the docks would look him in the eye and everyone tried to avoid him except for my master he greeted the captain with a hearty smile and a great handshake bart by the gods its been forever since youve pulled into port how have your travels been the captain gave out a loud and jolly laugh mathias they have been most excellent i have plenty of spoils that need unloading if you dont mind he ended his sentence with a jolly smile and a wink my master sent me with the captain right away to help unload by the gods you sure are an eager young lad the captain said after the last of his cargo was unloaded i sure could use a young man like yourself aboard me ship what dya say iidont know if my master would allow it i responded crushing my own dreams before they were realized leave that old codger to me ive know mathias for quite some time he said with a wink my hopes grew slightly i set out with my new master the very next morning i was to be his cabin boy he said it was like an apprentice i would learn his trade his name was captain black bart de la roja he was a jolly old man he called himself a free merchant but i knew it was piracy i didnt care i felt free after joining his crew i hadnt had a single nightmare of my mother or father it was freeing and exciting a few months after joining we found someone floating on some driftwood out at sea it was a girl she was just a year older than i was her name was miranda and she was the daughter of a servant traveling aboard a ship that had been attacked and sunk we took her in and bart made her a cabin girl along with me he taught us well showing us how to raid other ships and defend our own from attack we trained hard and fast ten years seemed to fly by but it was then that a ship raid went wrong shes dead thats all i could think i saw the captain of the other ship run her through i charged him and caught him off guard i was able to run him through the chest miranda lay there on the ground bleeding fast no dont die please i cried out to her i didnt want to lose her my mind raced back to my parent whom i had not thought of in years please dear gods no i dont want you to die shes dead i thought morty its okay im sorry about before no dont its okay just dont die im sorryabout thattoo i could feel her last breath escape her body no i sobbed and held her body close i brought her out to our ship after the captain had finished the battle by showing the crew their dead captain shes dead i couldnt stay aboard and asked the captain to let me go at the next port i found home in a small merchant port with a small crew of cut throats and pick pockets after gaining a small name in the underworld i found a backer to buy in on a ship with me by the name of bridge i promised her some percentage of each cut but as soon as the ship was done i ran off to a small village known as oarsmeet i had my crew start spreading rumors about me saying my mind was slipping that i had witnessed my own death several times im dead or who i was before i wish to no longer be weak if i had been stronger i could have gone with my father my mother would not have hated me i could have saved miranda i sailed around making quite the name for myself over the next few years it was only when the undead were knocking on our gates that some navy personnel actually asked for help from me and my ship we barely escaped in time we somehow found the new continent and helped them create a village we fought some terrible monsters that came from the woods i even helped a war effort by moving supplies but that was when i first discovered a taste of true power im dead and im reborn i now know i was wrong if i had had the power i needed i would have not needed my father or mother nor would i have been hurt by them i would not have needed miranda or anyone else in my life how could i have been so weak people are only a weakness strength and power are all that is needed the mother promised me power for helping her she will give it to me i tried to find her more but her voice stayed silent even in the swamp she remained silent but what spoke up was a man who came forth and proved to be my bastard son i thought him dimwitted and useless but when he said he was a shipwright i found a use for him i found a slave for myself as well she has served me well thus far and only proved more useful that bitch bridge managed to find me she wanted to collect her debt but i never had any intention of paying her so when the fighting broke out i cornered her shes dead her screams still bring me joy i took her scalp for a prize thank the mother shes dead her crew was easy enough to stomp out how weak humans are and how easily they are snuffed out life is nothing but a joke in the eyes of the gods praise to the mother she has finally sent me a messenger they call him the red eyed syndar he has opened my eyes more and more to the mothers plans he has given me a taste of the power the mother has promised me i want more i must grow stronger he says the syndar are the key thats why he could use my bastard i have another i can use im alive im truly alive i will give her to the mother she will die to open her eyes stop i shout as the others surround us the preacherman works at his ritual as they attack we are overwhelmed im dying no im bleeding im dragged near the outpost why is all they are shouting at me they do not understand how weak they all are lineth screams for me they somehow saved her but she seems to have been awoken i know not what happened to the preacherman i hear my bastard somewhere but i hear the mother she is louder she says crawl away so i do as she bids i heave myself towards the swamp as i am crawling i hear her screaming for me i hear them struggle with her i am in the swamp still bleeding and still crawling i hear rustling and lineth runs out to me she helps carry me farther into the swamp we rest and she tries to quell the torrent of blood flowing from me i hear more rustling and all i see are red eyes im not deadno let me go anne stared into the fire in the outpost she was rather surprised that the longfangs had allowed her to stay with them for a few more days but reyna had insisted it was just last night that morty had been cut down just outside of the gates that annes whole world had come crashing down she wanted to scream she wanted to cry she wanted to throw her weapons into the fire and take off into the swamp to slaughter anything that reeked of corruption with her bare hands but there was still work to be done reaching for her bow the former pirate rose and moved towards the outposts gate she felt a hand on her shoulder as she neared the threshold seeing a young ulven male no more than sixteen years old when she turned to see who had touched her hey you cant go out there we dont know if the whiteoak are gone yet and you could get lost and anne put her hand on the pups wrist cutting him off ill be fine trust me she said with a wink though her tired eyes betrayed her lack of sleep truth be told the thought of rest had scared her since the night before bow in hand anne set off into the woods the warm summer nights breeze flowed through her hair and caught her skirts like a sail almost pushing her forward her heart was still heavy from the day before but getting up and moving again would be good for her as anne crossed the tree line the exhaustion slipped from her mind she felt as though she heard every branch snap every leaf rustle with the movement of woodland animals with an arrow nocked she stalked through the woods to the north seeking to return to the site of the whiteoak camp which stanrick had ordered burned to the ground she moved quickly now forgoing stealth for speed her trained eye caught a slight blue glint in the moonlight while scanning the woods for potential threats drawing closer she saw the source of the distraction a small patch of finch leaves a deep blue color that reminded anne of the sea oh how she missed the sea so much of her time since she had come to mardrun had been spent playing politics managing the operations of new oarsmeet or trying to keep the captain out of trouble she hadnt truly been to sea in probably two years and had barely been on a ship in the past few months she missed the salted spray on her skin as her ship broke the waves she missed the slight twinge of fear she got standing up in the crows nest looking down at how far up she was more than anything she missed the swaying of the deck solid ground did not suit her well lost in her thoughts anne was nearly caught off guard by a dagger whizzing past her ear she turned to face her attacker seeing only a set of snarling fangs caught by the starlight careless she thought letting a mordok sneak up on her like that an arrow quickly found its way to her bowstring and was soon hurtling towards the mordok wedging itself deep in the tree behind which it had ben hiding before it took off running through the brush whispering a prayer to the huntress anne drew a barrier of magical energy around her allowing her to more intently focus on her prey she lowered her stance trying to move as silently as possible following the beasts trail the quick response to the initial attack had caught the mordok off guard and spooked it into running making following the trail much simpler her bow drawn and arrow ready anne was back the only place she felt as at home as on a ship anne was hunting again and it felt glorious for what seemed like an hour she followed the trail of broken branches and trampled brush until she found her quarry confident in the fact that it had just outrun the being stalking it the mordok had squatted down beside a pool of water eagerly lapping the water the small splashes made by the careless creature drowned the soft creak of her bow as she drew loosing an arrow with haste this projectile struck no tree the mordok gave a pained howl as the arrow came to rest deep in its side knowing better than to try to run again the mordok charged its attacker pulling a crude axe and a wickedlooking dagger from its belt anne tried to draw another arrow but her foe was simply too close she dropped her bow and pulled her fathers knife from its resting place at her side bracing for impact she waited until the mordok collided with her trying to tackle her instead she rode it to the ground using its own momentum against it confused by the change in direction the mordok shrieked in pain as the old dagger was thrust repeatedly between its ribs soon enough the creature stopped moving and anne wiped the blood from the dagger off on a scrap of fabric the mordok was wearing she began to make her way back to the outpost making a mental note to return to harvest the flowers the next morning little did anne know that the outpost itself would remind her of the events which had transpired the day before and soon enough her memories would return to haunt her once again i need to see him she had tried to help what more could she have possibly done the captain was beyond saving surely lineth must have seen that too anne was on her way back to new oarsmeet she had stayed an extra few days in the onsallas outpost at reynas urging hoping to see her recover before she left anne would hear none of it though far too proud to admit that she still hadnt slept four days later aris and santiago had departed immediately so anne was left to make the trek back to her home alone though she was glad for that each day she travelled and each night she tried to rest her eyes would close eager for the sweet release of sleep though her mind could not be torn from its current focus eager to return home anne continued walking when she could not sleep she found her way back to new oarsmeet in what seemed like less time than normal though her perception of time was far from spot on by the time she stepped into her own territory once more it was late afternoon when she came across the first tavern and evening once she found her way to her office and her home her door shut and locked anne smothered her head with her pillow hoping to finally be able to sleep and no outside sound would disturb her ive made my choice anne sat bolt upright her hand instinctively reaching for the dagger beside her bed beads of cold sweat had collected on her brow and her breathing was heavy it had been two weeks since the events took place and this had been the first sleep she had truly seen those wordsthe words she had hoped to never hear rang in her ears as if lineth was still in front of her hoping to find an escape from her thoughts anne quickly dressed herself and stepped out into the new oarsmeet streets pulling her cloak around her tightly despite the warmth and lack of breeze anne tried to appreciate the town before her the drunken stupor in which many of the residents constantly lived was astounding surely a coping mechanism for many hard winters hungry nights and far too much bloodshed in recent years had certainly taken its toll on morale but between the hearty sea shanties bellowed from various taverns the occasional tradesman sober enough to recognize the only remaining authority figure in the settlement and the curious glances from childrens bedside windows a stranger would have had no idea this town had been through so much in the last decade an alliance born of the need to survive by naval sailors and pirates alike anne half expected the whole thing to fall apart to infighting within the month yet here it stood ten years later she prayed that the town wasnt a mirror of herself though strong even thriving on the surface but hollow inside just trying not to crumble in on itself anne turned between two buildings as she saw two sailors drunkenly stumble around before her not wishing to be disturbed this was her first night back in new oarsmeet since half of her crew had been taken from her and she wished to be alone with her thoughts no one could see her as she was they needed strength now more than ever and that was simply something she couldnt be right now leaning against the wooden wall of the building behind her anne couldnt help but overhear the conversation between the two drunks or at least what was left of it ihici dont know tony she could hear one of them slur it just dont seem right it aint mick the other replied but thats just how it is course shes gonna go back to im after all hes put her through still youd think she woulda jus run away if nothin else yeah but i guess shes made her choice something in annes brain snapped she saw red then she saw nothing she came to a few seconds later standing in the middle of the street with an overwhelming pain in her wrist tonys face was in the dirt a small pool of blood starting to form underneath his head mick was shouting for help trying to fumble for some kind of weapon in his drunken haze confused anne pleaded with mick to calm down that she could help his friend but only if he would relax and find a healer or a cleric eventually mick dropped his sword and ran off still screaming but his tone was more concerned than frightened anne reached for the necklace she used as a focus for the huntress magic when bursts of pain shot through her right hand up to her elbow looking down a nasty bruise was already beginning to form but it was much less serious than the wounds she had apparently inflicted on tony with her left hand she dug out the necklace and began the incantation pulling tonys dwindling life force back into his body and staving off death for the time being when the spell was complete anne said a quick prayer thanking the huntress for finding her when she had enough things had gone wrong recently murder of one of the citizens under her protection was not an issue she needed now applying pressure to tonys wound anne waiting until mick returned with a man known for his skill with divine magic as the cleric was fixing the rest of tonys face mick took the time to remind anne of what had just happened since she remembered none of it when anne had snapped she ran from behind the building punching tony several times in the face and stomach drawing her dagger with her left hand when mick had tried to intervene and protect his nowunconscious friend anne dropped the dagger and threw a punch at micks head missing wide and striking the stone wall behind him mick remembered hearing an awful crunch then a lot of screaming mostly me own i reckon he tried to joke though the fear was still present in his eyes anne apologized profusely for her actions and was about to walk away but stopped short as her curiosity got the better of her how did you know did word honestly reach you down here so quickly what do ye mean maam mick was truly confused now the slave girl lineth who told you with all due respect maam what are you drinking its either too strong or not strong enough i didnt say nothin about the slave girl heck i aint seen her or the captain in months i was talkin about that sweet lass molly malone she keeps runnin back to that psycho rupert even though everyone knows hes a cheatin little bastard weve all seen the bruises too but i guess shes made her decision and there aint nothin we can do now maam the realization brought on by those words hit anne like a ton of bricks her shattered wrist was excruciating and should probably be looked at but more importantly she would need to get her emotions in check she needed to be strong like the people of new oarsmeet for the people of new oarsmeet and she could not be strong as long as she was tired nor could she be stable when such a simple phrase even out of context could anger her so badly tomorrow she thought to herself tomorrow i will fix everything tomorrow came and wentdecisions written by shana aber as selena stargazer selena why are you packing stanrick asks as he walks in after a pack meeting eyeing me while i casually throw clothes into my travel bags crows landing is having a market faire puckerman mentioned it during his lessons today he wants to go home for it and i want to go with i state plainly stanrick frowns at me what i ask as i look up from folding my shirts but you are pretty far along he frowns i sigh i have at least three months yet i also have two formal students puckerman and echo that i would like to understand their nontraditional ways a little more if i understand what it is he does or will be doing and where he came from i can alter lessons so it will be easier for him to understand  stanrick is still frowning i am not going to be able to talk you out of this am i i smile at him and just like the swamp you are going to follow me anyways he glares at me a little not funny i walk over and kiss his forehead sorry it will also do you good to get out of here for awhile besides i miss you i havent seen much of you the last few weeks stanrick sighs i know the pack is still trying to sort things out after soulviegs death i nod i know i can see evidence of that all over the village but they will be fine without you for a while you need some time to sort things out in your own head as well stanrick goes and pulls out his travel bags from the storage chest i know you are right i frown you dont have to go if you dont want to its not like i am heading out alone i am going to be traveling with puckerman bridget and keres are coming with as well bridget and keres havent been outside of everspring much so they want to take the opportunity to see other places as well i smirk its a pack trait the curiosity to see and learn new things stanrick rolls his eyes at me you know full well i cant let you travel without me its my job to protect you not puckerman or keres i sigh but am quietly glad hes coming with he may not remember but i do the new aldorian market faire was the night that we first talked till the wee hours of the morning and first time he stayed with me there may have not been mating the first time but that was the place where he caught my attention that was about a year ago now so many changes in a year  stanrick do you have a moment someone calls to him and he walks off i sigh again as he leaves me to wander the faire this has been the theme for much of the market faire i dont know whyno wait i know exactly why the civil war is still a plague to everyone not just ulvens though it is our problem the outsiders want to see someone in charge doing something they have no understanding of how our political system works they want change right away and no patience to let it come in its own time they had all been to the outpost at some point or another and they longed for stable forceful leadership there even though its not their home never mind our own traditions and the way things work i sigh grumpily and munch on various food stuffs i have to admit some were quite tasty and i am going to have to see about starting a couple cherry trees up by the swamp these things could made some beautiful wine i will have to tell my uncles about them i watch stanrick as he spends most of the day talking to various people though he did stop by and check on me every so often its not what i was hoping for but in all honesty i shouldnt be surprised stanrick does what he does best talk i watched how the rangers deal with things and giggled a little i think they had a stark awaking to what its like when your home is the center of attention i do hope it translates to better behavior and more support when they are at the outpostas i watch everyone move and flutter about it makes me reflective i watch a young mage out of the corner of my eye trying to connect with nature i dont think he found what he was looking for though i watch anne as she was suddenly deemed not a pirate and apparently that young mage is also one of hers as well i am not sure what that means but wish them luck its going to be hard to get rid of a reputation that you tried so hard to build in the first place though i think it will make her stronger she understands the value of remembering where one came from i gave my respects to the prince of new aldoria stanrick like normal spent more time talking to him than i if you want to understand the culture you talk to the common folk i feel more comfortable there than talking to the elite classes it was that way with my own job i hate talking to clan leaders and even chieftains i think thats why i stumbled so much when i had to talk to khulgar as i sit in my chair under the shade of the umbrella it dawns on me what i have to do next but i dont want to i spent time talking to the silver syndar phaedra i learned a lot about their culture and class system she has access to a syndar library the idol popped in my head reminding me that i still need to answer to that like a subtle reminder of yes your path is changing you still need to find answers but to different problems now no there was nothing subtle about what came next i would have had to be a fool for not noticing it i spent a lot of time talking to the richtcrag armors mate he kept dragging off my mate so i spent time talking to his i learned about her culture and what they believe its remarkably similar to our own they even have markingstheir eyes change apparently becoming blue like the sky in winter though i am unclear if they are born that way or if they change sometime later they do not get the animalistic touches like ulven do but i do wonder if the winter wolf touched them somehow there are some differences especially when it comes to how females are treated and trained but she asked me if i could teach her she will probably be easier to train than puckerman mostly because she is already female even if she is an outsider apparently in their culture they like to know if they are having male or female pups so they have a ritual that will tell them i let her perform this ritual on me i want to see what it was like and to get a feel for what she already knows we may have run into the same problem that happened when puckerman tried to use the dagger before he understood the ways of our magic i think some sort of feedback loop or magic hiccup happened according to her magic she thinks i am having both a male and a female i just shrug we are not known to have multiple births and nobody in my family has so i have no reason to think that it was an accurate reading that pretty much made my decision three students and i am not even a full witch its pretty clear on what my path should be i feel like i want to cry as now i know what i need next the only person who knows i have made my decision is one i havent even told stanrick yet i think its because i just made it and i needed to say it out loud to someone to make it seem real i am fairly shaken by my decision yet i know its what i have do gaias been giving me signs all daysome not subtle at all surprisingly one understands why it was such a hard decision to make he also understands my plight and says he will send me information when he could apparently he too is going to be stuck in one spot for a while i tell him to not tell stanrick yet  are you okay beloved stanrick asks as we lay in the tent after having left the market faire i have been restless all night i cant seem to sleep i am leaving my pack and clan i whisper he sits up and looks at me i can see the smile pull at the corners of his mouth though he is trying not to you sure i close my eyes no but gaia was quite clear at the faire on what path she needs me to follow he kisses my forehead itll be okay youre still going to be part of your family  i sigh and look at him he really believes it i didnt have the heart tell him that while i will be welcomed at pack gatherings and the like i will be treated as an outsider i wont be able to help with rites i will have to trade for things not just given them because i am a part of the pack i may still be family by blood but that doesnt mean much when you arent dedicated to supporting the blood stanrick cuddles in close and whispers in my ear just like i told you that first nighteverything will be okay i didnt reply i could feel the tears stinging my eyes and didnt trust my voice not to betray me he remembered  how could you keres screams at me what about tradition bridget and keres both figured out why we were heading to everspring instead of back to the outpost after about three days because i have to i state quietly she gets up in my face the hurt and betrayal is written all over her face as clear as day tears stinging the corner of her eyes that is mordok dung and you know it you always have a choice and now you are choosing him over your pack and your duty she snarls what is going on here stanrick growls as he comes back with an armload of wood he drops the wood and grabs keres by the collar of her shirt and pulls her back they need me more with the death of soulvieg they dont even have a full witch rill and i are on the same level but she doesnt know how to handle the corruption she has never really taught anyone she is a great organizer and knows how to maintain the village but not much else i state keres shrugs out of stanricks grasp her eyes blazing with rage and pain we need you too the pack still doesnt have a witch since grandma freya died i sigh yes i knowbut there are also many candidates for that roll your own sister being one of them you also have high priestess morrigan as well the longfangs even dont have that there is no higher clan structure for them to turn to i could bring that even if its indirectly females dont leave males come to us just as the great wolf joined the first pack you are going against tradition here she yells look at the ground i know keres stomps the ground tears on her cheeks fine go throw your life away she turns and storms off bridget stands there and looks at me tears in her eyes but she comes up and hugs me i understand but i dont like it you will still teach me right she asks i hug her back of course i will stanrick comes up and looks at bridget go find your sister she was yelling loud enough i think half the territory heard her i dont want her getting jumped by something in the state she is in bridget frowns you dont think she can handle it stanrick smiles a little no i think she will not know when to stop if something does find her right now bridget sighs yeah probably you do know she is going to blame you stanrick nods i would rather have her blame me than selena she will get over it bridget nods and goes to find her sister i sink down by the fire grabbing a piece of wood that stanrick had brought and placed it on i wipe my cheeks on my tunic are you okay love stanrick asks no i state quietly as i watch the fire that went as well as i expected but it still hurts he pulls me into his arms as a fresh batch of tears start down my face  selena was fast asleep now after everything that happened she had a hard time falling asleep and would not let go of stanrick she tried to hide her tears but it was no use they heard bridget bring keres back but she was still really upset and this made it even harder finally she exhausted herself so badly that she could not keep her eyes open and she fell asleep her grip loosened and stanrick slipped out of bed to check on the fire bridget looks up and was curious to see what would happen though stanrick could tell her muscles are tight ready to spring up just in case what he asked as he tosses a log on the fire watching keres glare at him out of the corner of his eye i want to hurt you keres growls as she sits sharpening her sword with a wet stone yeah then do it get it all out because i rather you go after me than go after selena stanrick walks over and stands before her his chest was exposed and the heat steams off him in the cool night air she looks at his scars stands up and socks him in the abdomen she thought it would have more give but it didnt she hit it again and again with each strike the tears began to flow feel better he asks when she falls to her knees sobbing before him knowing full well she did not no this doesnt change anything all it does is just hurt me she cries out while rubbing her knuckles yeah thats all it ever does now do you want to talk about all this he asks as he kneels down beside her i hate you how could you do this to us how could you take her away she says in angry sobs do what i did nothing selena made her own choice i cannot tell her what to do this was what she chose to do and it was not an easy choice no choice is as ulven we are lucky in a way that most choices we make in our lives are small what we want to eat or what tunic we want to wear the big choices are made by a chief clanleader or our priestesses we are spoiled that way but one day you will find that you have choices big ones life changing ones and they are hard i made the choice to protect your cousin rather than go with my shield brothers we make choices and do what we believe is right and we have to live with that choice no matter what others may think of us he pulls out a small piece of cloth and gives it to keres you chose to be with her i thought you were ordered she says as she wipes her eyes no i made that choice soulvieg gave it to me to this day i do not know why selena gave me the choice to say no when she chose me to mate with her i knew what she was doing was important so i could not let her go on her own i also chose to take her as my life mate keres i care about her more than i knew i could i make choices not only to protect my pack but my family and above all others protect selena i swore an oath to do so in this life and in death i know you feel like she is leaving you but she will always be blood no changing of pack can take that away youre not losing anyone the stress that she is going through is more dangerous you do not just hurt her you hurt little one too stanrick calmly states bridget walks over and sits by them moving close to stay warm but why cant you just join our pack you would be welcome you could probably become the warleader if you wanted she says as she leans in and puts the blanket over his shoulders then what would become of my pack they lost their warriors and their leader yes i could but not all would be as welcomed into the fold as i would be not all of them are as open minded about things stanrick replies i dont pretend to fully understand what youre going through i cant but i do know what its like to lose family you need to also realize that family is not just pack loyalties but blood and the ones you keep in your heart you two are also my family i was just surprised that you saw me that way is it ok if i join you asks selena from behind them she was wrapped in the heavy rabbit fur blanket no one knew how long she had stood there i am sorry cousin says keres with a sob i know i also know you are still going to be angry for awhileand its okay selena says they sit and watch the stars a while  the walls of everspring rose up in front of us as we walk down the path my heart sinks lower and lower the closer we get bridget looks at me i nod and she sprints off ahead stanrick is about to stop her i grab his arm and shake my head this needs to play out as tradition demands otherwise i will never be able to come back i state solemnly stanrick frowns at me but nods and takes my hand we are all very quiet the rest of the way to everspring i had already been trying to prepare myself mentally and emotionally for this but my walls feel very fragile i just hope they hold we stop at the drunken uncle to drop off our things bowmen looks surprised when i come in but then gets very serious as he studies my face he knows something is up without saying a word i place three rabbits on the counter and head upstairs to stash my stuff and change my clothes i come back down in the best outfit that i can manage to get around my ever enlarging belly normally i would throw on my best gambeson but i cant get it closed around me currently i can barely get my boots back on by myself i straighten my torc and look around the room bowmen comes around the counter and hugs me i am pretty sure stanrick told him what i am about to do youre always welcome here your father would find me in the great forest and kick my ass up and down the pathways if i didnt take care of his daughter regardless of what pack she is in he whispers in my ear my lip quivers and i can feel the baby shift uneasily in my tummy all i can do is nod i am afraid my voice will crack if i try to speak now stanrick takes my hand and leads me to the great hall keres opens the doors for me of course the great hall is packed full of people it was the middle of the afternoon i wouldnt expect it to be anything less large and flashy and in front of a lot of people word travels fast for that there is no questioni suddenly feel very vulnerable i weave my way to the front to stand before clanleader cahal spiritclaw and high priestess morrigan sol fire bridget stands to the left of the high priestess and next to chieftain faelan chieftain erin stargazer stands next to gjerta and henrick henrick is looking confused and uneasy as he picks up on the emotions of those around him i know bridget told them everything they all wear solemn expressions i can feel the energy in the room changing i gather my courage and voice clanleader cahal gets to his feet and slams his cane down everyone becomes silent i can feel myself waiver but i pull myself up tall clanleader spiritclaw i wish to present to you my last report as a truthseeker and beg for release from my duties so that i may pursue the calling that the mother has put before me  i state loud and clear for the whole room to hear he looks down at me what duties do you feel she has laid before you that are heavier than the duties to your pack and clan i wish to join and aid pack longfang with soulviegs passing their daughters lack the ability to figure out new solutions to the ever growing corruption i have already taken on three students in less than a seasons time gaia is using my skills that i have developed as a truthseeker and now has me asking a different set of questions to a new set of problems i feel i would be failing both duties if i tried to split my time between the two i state you wish to leave pack stargazer as well chieftain erin asks yes rhya i know i would be the first female to leave in three generations but if i am going to help pack longfang they need to see me as one of them i reply i feel stanrick shift uneasily beside me both erin and cahal look at stanrick she is correct rhya pack longfang doesnt like outsiders regardless if they are ulven or not he states plainly cahal turns to consult both morrigan and erin though i think its mostly for show truthseeker stargazer approach cahal states i approach the stairs and he nods i remove my torc from my neck he takes one end while i hold the other you have served your pack and clan well i release you to fly free and pursue what your heart desires your work was honorable and truthful may it ring his ears he states loudly for the room to hear thank you rhya i state i look to erin meet at the stone tomorrow i will gather the elders she states solemnly i nod selena meet with me for dinner and give your final report that shall be your final duty as truthseeker cahal says to me yes rhya i nod i look down at the torc and i have to force myself to let go of my end i didnt think it was going to be this hard i bite my bottom lip to keep it from quivering and turn and walk down the steps stanrick nods to the elders and walks with me that went better than i was expecting stanrick says as he helps me down the steps that was the easy part i sigh  selena walks in the front door of the drunken uncle and she looks exhausted she turns to her mate i am going to go lay down for a while she states ill come too stanrick smiles selena shakes her head dont i need some alone time she frowns stanrick frowns after her as she walk up the stairs stanrick sits down at the bar with a huff she will be fine says bowmen as he fills a mug for stanrick i dont understand why this is so hard for everyone everyone is acting like she is going to go into the black or something stanrick shakes his head bowmen frowns she didnt tell you did she tell me what stanrick asks over the rim of the mug bowmen sighs no of course she wouldnt because she is stubborn and thinks she needs to shoulder it all herself  he pulls a stool around to the other side of the bar so he can sit your into the black analogy isnt all that far off physically yes she will still be of the blood but she is choosing to leave socially she will be treated as an outsider she no longer has the protection of the clan so if past mistakes come back she has to endure them on her own she can ask for help but she has to earn it now or barter for it just like any other outsider bowmen shakes his head though really that isnt what bothers her i am assuming she needs to go meet with people at her homelands correct yeah we are doing that tomorrow stanrick states bowmen frowns tomorrow they are going to sever her connection with the homelands stanrick looks up from his drink and nearly spits it out they can do that bowmen nods its painful for a daughter they are connected stronger to their homelands than your standard pack member she can still give energy to the barrier and protection spells since she is blood but if they fall she will never know it also means when she dies she will be unable to find the homelands which means she will never see her family or her first mate or her other children again stanrick blinks in disbelief do you think if she wanders the great forest she will find them bowmen shrugs i dont know unless she joins another pack and ties herself to their homelands she will wander the forest never knowing the comfort of a home basically becoming a ronin spirit stanrick frowns she is going to join my pack so there is no worry there bowmen smiles good i didnt think you would let her wander the forest though this is going to be really hard for her  what about the pup she is carrying  he asks absently bowmen shrugs if they die before marking they go live with luna i suppose they would have a choice which homelands to return to though i would guess they would return to yours since that is where you guys will be stanrick nods he doesnt bother correcting the notion that they dont have a homeland nobody in the family remembers where they were from originally stanrick stares into his mead absently  dinner was solemn even henrick was fairly quiet throughout dinner nobody wanted to ask if i was sure about my decision because they all knew the answer i finally couldnt take it anymore i want to know i dont know if i can have meetings like this again i cant leave and not know i set my fork down on my plate and look at my elders you all knew that this was going to happen didnt you this is why you sent me to onsallas to study outsider culture instead of new hope or crows landing where an assignment like that wouldve made more sense i say accusingly cahal and morrigan look at each other before looking at me i narrow my eyes a little dont lie to me i may not be an official truthseeker anymore but i still have all the skills cahal smirks a little as sighs see i knew you would figure out something was up soulvieg asked me to make sure you were up at onsallas i dont know why i figured she wanted to train you personally in something i also knew with the death of their elite war pack stanrick was going to be needed up there as well cahal smiles and takes gjertas hand i knew he would follow you anywhere and i couldnt have that so it was easier to just assign you to the same place i knew he was needed  morrigan shakes her head i knew i had to train you beyond just being a normal witch the runes had shown me that soulviegs letter to me asked as well though she stated the corruption at the outpost being the reason you had many paths before you you had to pick one you can be indecisive sometimes trying to make everyone happy though once the letter came that soulvieg had died i knew it was more than a possibility that you may leave the fact that soulvieg had no one to replace her was well known among the other priestesses your skills as truthseeker probably made it clear to you that there was no one to take her place either i frown rill has the skills to maintain the village shes been doing that since she was little but she doesnt have the skills to teach others soulvieg was a powerful priestess but from what i have pieced together she was sick most of her time so she wasnt a good teacher and rill had to take care of her rill excels at things i dont like runes and potions i excel at things like rites and cleansings rill should be leaps and bounds ahead of me considering she started training much much younger than i but we are on the same level with different focuses i think we could really could do well together but right now she would rather see me eaten by mordok i dont think its that bad stanrick frowns i sigh she blames me for soulviegs death that is clear as day she has had a chip on her shoulder since i first appeared in the village and even more so after my one meeting with soulvieg she shoulder checked me when i went to go do the laundry after getting back to onsallas after our winter stay here she did that stanrick growls i nod she does it again i will wipe the floor with her stanrick frowns at me i shrug either way we are going to have to work together in order to succeed with the corruption spot outside the outpost neither of us are strong enough to do it on our own right now the longfangs are used to taking orders from one person now thats gone and they appear lost  well that not entirely true stanrick states i frown what do you mean stanrick smiles they voted me in as chieftain before we left for crows landing everyones heads snap up to look at stanrick in surprise i glare at him to the point where he shrinks back in his seat a little before rising up to his full height stanrick longfang chieftain of pack longfang he pauses to take a deep breath even i still think it sounds weird gjerta grins at me trust me child this will not be the last thing he does to make you glare at him you are going to get so many more opportunities especially now stanrick frowns i dont want that to go beyond this room he glares at the guards who shift uneasily cahal tilts his head what are you planning stanrick replies i want our enemies to think that the longfangs are still floundering for leadership i want them to think that we are vulnerable that way we can be more than ready for them when they come we know they will especially when they hear we sent people to go raiding with axhound i am expecting grimward to try and use that to their advantage and attack the outpost quite possibly the village as well cahal smiles this is why you have the reputation as the clever longfang  morrigan shakes her head it appears we are all done here come selena lets leave the males to talk fighting we have a different fight to get you ready for high priestess morrigan gjerta and erin stand and help me up we head towards morrigans study i cant believehe didnthad i known i wouldnt have had us leave i snarl gjerta smiles get used to it there is going to be so many more things he doesnt tell you because he feels that he needs to keep you safe she winks at me you will find them out anyways given timehe just doesnt know that yet i growl under my breath as i take a seat in a chair in the study youre really going to leave us arent you cousin erin asks i look down at my lap yeah  morrigan frowns you know what that means i nod i will lose my connection to the stargazer homelands i will be able to add strength to the shields since i am a blood stargazer but should the shields go down i will never know nor will i be able to find the homelands when i die erin frowns are you going to keep the name i shrug probably for a while i wont be able to join the longfangs till after the pup is born they wont let me do it while i am pregnant too afraid of hurting the pup if i change it ill let you know erin nods i am going to go and start gathering the elders i nod erin leaves and closes the door behind her gjerta nods i am going to put henrick to bed she gives me a hug you will be fine remember what i told you before you left you are always welcome here regardless morrigan is gliding across her room gathering things now that they are gone please tell me whats on your mind i frown the longfangs dont have a homeland stanricks mother left a book which i dont think he has ever fully read most dont know where they had started from there is a loose family history but that started with soulviegs generation i think she was the last one who knew where they were from and she never told anyone else so even when i join their pack i am going to be doomed to wonder the forest morrigan looks at me how many of the blood rites to you know i frown i know the individual joining and severing of a pack member morrigan nods there are others if you are going to walk this path you need to know them all if they dont have one make them one make them a proper pack spiritually that is your new job to guide them spiritually rill and you may be on the same level right now but i see you going so much farther after the pup is born you are to come back here and finish your training understood the conviction i heard in morrigans voice was pretty astounding i just nod my head yes rhya i will also gather supplies and transcribe some rites for you to take with back to onsallas that should help you deal with the corruption better and hopefully figure out a way to cleanse it until then drink this she hands me a cup of what appears to be tea it will protect the pup from the shock of the severing tomorrow unfortunately that is something i cant protect you from  i drag my feet as we head up the path i am going slowly on purpose i want to savor this feeling this connectedness i am terrified stanrick is pulling the cart next to me keres and bridget are already at the site probably helping set up we break into the clearing and i stop dead in my tracks i think erin gathered half the pack there is a processional line on either side of the path from the entrance to the rock gods i swear as i inhale a shaky breath and rub my hands over my face to try to get the tears to stop stanrick looks amazed at the amount of people gathered for this did she gather your entire pack he asks as we stand there in amazement no though i swear this has to be half i mumble i swallow hard leave the cart here they will bring it in we start up the path everyone is hugging me touching me crying and telling me they will miss me i cant help but to start to cry we finally get to the front there at the base of the rock stand erin garik bridget and keres along with the elders uncles waylen pryderi grandmas frayas brother drudwyn and his mate lone high priestess morrigan is there along with her daughters deidra and breanna probably to help oversee the rite since we have no formal witch yet cousin maeve steps up with the bowl and the knife deidra and breanna step up next to me and slightly behind me on either side they whisper in my ear we are here to catch you when you fall deidra starts and to make sure the baby isnt harmed breanna finishes i nod lightly meave comes forward and holds up the bowl today we say goodbye to one of our own she chooses to find gaias calling outside the arms of the pack and we have agreed to let her go in good faith meave calls out to the people behind us i try very hard to stare at the rock behind everyone as tears run down my cheeks she knows she is loved and will be missed and knows we will no longer be there as we once were but trusts in our strength to survive without her as the great wolf had to sever his ties with his pack to join gaias pack we will now sever hers from ours so that she may make bonds with her new one meave walks over to erin who holds out her hand meave cuts it and she bleeds into the bowl she also does this for uncles waylen pryderi and grandpa drudwyn she walks over to me and i hold out my hand she slices it across the palm i turn my hand over and bleed into the bowl meave then walks up to high priestess morrigan who from a pouch pours a clear liquid into the bowl she turns tears in her eyes her voice cracking a little as she talks fire cleanses all things but it also destroys so with clean conscience we send you forth on your own selena with all the love and best wishes we can she takes a stone flint from her pouch and strikes it the bowl ignites with a whoosh and i feel like my heart is about to explode i feel my legs give out as i grab my chest deidra and breanna catch me and hold me upright until the feeling passes about the same time as the fire dies down there is an emptiness i know what the feeling is supposed to be but its not there now i can still feel my connection to gaia i look around some of them feel it too like there was something there and now its gone someone lets out a mournful howl from the back and the rest join in i bite my cheek until i taste blood to keep from crying out in pain and emptiness erin and garik hug me and so does uncle waylen and pryderi i walk up to grandpa drudwyn with a shaky voice i say when you go to the homelands tell them why i will not be there give my mom and dad my love tell torolf i am sorry tell my other children that i love them and i am sorry that mommy will not get to see them  the old grey ulven looks at me and nods solemnly before hugging me and whispers in my ear they will not be ashamed of you they will find you in the forest i look at everyone one last time as they part to take the processional out i walk stanrick takes my hand and walks beside me i do not turn around and look i cantstanrick does for me though they are all crying he mumbles tears are streaming down my cheeks i knowknock knock knock come in anne called through the heavy door of her office a slight young man stepped over the threshold striking her by how much he had grown since they had first picked him up in oarsmeet seated at her desk annes gaze gradually came to meet the boys you asked to see me maam his voice was steady but there was anxiety in his eyes relax youre not in trouble i need to speak to you about the future your future his nervous eyes grew wide though he struggled to maintain his composure tell me how are you at keeping secrets not from your enemies but from your friends those you once called allies ii dont know pretty good i would say he stammered i need you to be perfect can i count on you tell me first who exactly am i keeping this from his curiosity piqued anne knew better than to reveal her plan so soon ill ask again can i count on you yes yes you can i wont tell a soul the boy promised eager to be let in on the secret anne reached into a drawer on her desk quickly removing a small sheet of paper it had been sealed with wax bearing the compass rose crest of aldoria which the boy recognized as the symbol anne had been using for official new oarsmeet business for many years she stepped outfrom behind her desk extending the letter to him but pulled back as he reached out to grasp it then prove it this is not for your eyes it is not for mortys eyes this is for the highest ranking official in new aldoria with whom you can speak understood confusion was written as clearly on his face as the nervousness previously had he was intrigued wanting to tear open the letter then and there to read its contents although he knew annes blades were never far away and to do so would be suicide instead he simply nodded good its a long trip to take alone you should stock up and get going soon head down to the warehouse the workers are expecting you she turned and walked back to her desk but remained standing anne whats going on is everything okay the boy prodded hoping to sate some of his curiosity why cant the captain know why am i being sent why cant you go whats in this letter youre asking a lot of questions when you should be leaving like i said you have a long road ahead of you the sooner you begin the sooner you finish i trust you anne i really do youre the only officer who doesnt always treat me like im worthless but i cant do this not without a few answers first he took a step closer urging his now shaking voice to sound soothing this was clearly important to the first mate but why couldnt she tell him anything i suppose youve been doing well recently youve put up with a lot from us and have become a man because ofnodespite us ill try to explain stop me if you have any questions anne turned to face the boy her face as solemn as her tone a mix of pride fear and determination flashed in her eyes before she began to speak again i wasnt always a pirate long ago i was actually a lieutenant in aldorias royal navy my captain crew and i scoured the seas for people like what i have become i left because i disagreed with an order i still know in my heart that doing so was the right move what was the mistake however was throwing my lot in with morty and his band that was ten years ago i was young and they promised me adventure and silver they werent wrong but i am starting to believe that i was i should have stayed behind in oarsmeet and died fighting the undead i should have stayed a prisoner of my old crew and started a new life in the new world i should have done something anything except what i did i realize this now but i fear it may be too late i dont know if youve noticed but morty has been actively working to keep me out of the loop on many decisions his demeanor has changed over the last few months and now it seems that his son is following in his footsteps i dont know what has come over them but i do know that i dont like it and want no part of it thats what the letter is its a chance at a new life actually it may be a chance at my old life im hoping to communicate with new aldoria to reenlist myself and any from new oarsmeet who wish to join me in the aldorian navy morty cannot know because i would hate to see his reaction i can only assume it would be violent this is why i cannot go if i were to suddenly take a trip to new aldoria morty would become suspicious you avoid his notice most times and others he would be glad to be rid of you you have given me no reason to distrust you so far and i need you to continue to do so take this letter and give me an opportunity to redeem myself for the crimes i have committed this past decade you are free to make your own decision regarding my departure but in a few months time one way or another i will be leaving the crew stay go or come with me the choice is yours i wish only that it didnt have to be the case youre serious youre leaving the crew what will become of the town of the ship the boy pressed awestruck by the words he had just heard dead serious the town is under my protection i will remain here and lead the people if i can or encourage them to come with me if i cannot the people are resourceful im sure they can find some way to make their homes elsewhere anne explained her eyes started to dart around the room clearly anxious that this conversation was still continuing as for the ship that belongs to morty he may sail it wherever he wishes but will know that he is no longer welcome in the port of new oarsmeet im coming with you this life is clearly not for me and the crew doesnt care about me im a joke to them and im sick of it hell just look at the name they gave me we could leave tonight they wouldnt be able to stop us until we were long gone the boy was getting excited by the idea of freedom from the crew no i cant i have a responsibility to the people here and have other matters to which i must attend you must leave now though the sooner that letter reaches prince aylin or one of his officers the sooner we can put this whole matter behind us anne said sitting down at her desk once again she glanced up at the boy oh and artyom thank you it is nice to know that im not in this alone the boy was struck once again by her words and stood staring at the first mate everything okay anne asked him taken aback by his response youyouve never called me that before the young mage began before trailing off would you prefer to go back to being swabby no no thank you ill be back as quickly as i can with a responseonsallas outpost longfang territory shortly after discovering soulviegs artifact brother i think i am ready to see home again ranmir told stanrick we will need to find you a place to stay selena and i have taken over mothers and we need it ready to raise a pup again he replied i understand if we cannot find a place it isnt as if i dont know how to make shelter maybe we can raise a small shack for me on the outskirts i dont know if im ready to be in the center of things anyway i may just stay in the outpost for a while no no brother of mine will stay at the outpost you are coming home lets go ranmir and stanrick started to gather their equipment to head to onsallas village but were interrupted by reyna and fritha weve been discussing the possibility of you returning to the village cousin reyna said to ranmir and we do not think you should enter the village before you are clean so ill bathe no problem i can fetch the water now this time it was fritha to respond water will not clean off what we are concerned about we feel that you have spent too much time in the dirge swamp to be allowed into the village without taking certain measures for the corruption and thrand agrees why does everyone keep talking about me behind my back i heard you the first night i came into the outpost wondering who i was if i should be trusted why i brought the news you should have just asked me why didnt you just ask me brother stanrick said consolingly please calm down we did not know who you were you came in with a worrying message about what is coming and a cryptic one about who you were this temper is not like what i remember you to be yes cousin this is what we are talking about reyna said the swamp has changed you we just want to take some precautions to make sure that you are not corrupted ranmir thought about this for a while as he finished gathering his belongings would this hurt is there any way to go back to the way he was thirteen years alone is a long time would he be able to rejoin the pack truly he knew the others hoped it would be possible as did he he was feeling a comfort that had not been known since curiosity had gotten the better of him so long ago he had hoped that he could put an end to the war with the mordok much as the war had ended with the humans and the syndar he had failed but would he be able to succeed at coming home what do we need to do and how long will it take as of now cousin we are not sure in a hut outside onsallas village three weeks later sixth attempt ranmir laid on a pallet in the middle of the room asleep rill stood ready yet again for the signal from reyna that the draught had sedated him when reyna nodded rill extended her arms and cast a barrier in the same hut outside onsallas village three days earlier fifth attempt ranmir woke with a start he did not know where he was he vaguely remembered being brought to this village the mordok shaman was once again casting his paininducing magic upon him he tried to grab the mordok to fight out of his predicament but his arms and legs were pinned down in the background he saw a pointyeared figure with red eyes extending his arms preparing for an embrace with a mocking smile on his lips he lowered his arms and stepped forward as the mordok looked to guidance the redeyed one spoke ranmir calm down please it was rills voice we are trying to help if you wish to come back into the village we must make sure that you are safe sixth attempt with a pained look on her face reyna doublechecked that the restraints were secure she did not like the idea of tying her cousin down for this but for their safety it had to be done in the same hut outside onsallas village two weeks earlier second attempt ranmirs eyes opened the mordok shaman was working his staff around his face attempting gaia knows what upon him ranmirs hands shot around the throat of the shaman seemingly of their own volition the redeyed one took a step forward thrust out his hand and there was a bright flash of light ranmir looked dazedly upon fritha and rill rill was holding her throat with fritha taking a defensive position in front of her sixth attempt reyna called upon gaia for assistance to cleanse her cousin of the darkness that the swamp left him with it would go faster with two she knew but they had tried that once in the same hut outside onsallas village two weeks four days earlier first attempt ranmirs chest felt about to burst he had not breathed this hard since the sprint from the pineed forest when his brother vanished in front of his eyes his lungs felt like they were on fire his heart about to escape his ribcage fritha and reyna crouched in front of pallet upon which he had been resting what is wrong cousin reyna asked it hurts whatever you are doing hurts i cant take it it is going too fast what do you mean too fast this time it was fritha inquiring i dont knowthe painit feels likefire inside me sixth attempt gaias gift began to flow through reyna she saw ranmirs face begin to react to the pain he was feeling even in his slumber in the same hut outside onsallas village six days earlier fourth attempt ranmir felt a burning at his fingertips he looked down at them and saw they were resting in embers he tried to pull them out but couldnt move his arms he could focus on nothing else but his fingers as he wriggled he caught a glimpse of a mordok but as he tried to look closer only saw fritha looking down in concentration sixth attempt reyna felt the warmth of gaias love as it tried to replace the darkness that had coalesced on ranmir in a hut outside onsallas village ten days earlier third attempt ranmir looked up at the mordok he knew this mordok he had seen him somewhere long ago or was it only moments ago could recent events have been a dream time seemed to be a blur sixth attempt ranmirs mind began to travel as the darkness gave way to light the time lost to the swamp began to come back he remembered having been visited by the redeyed one who would talk to him and make him forget he remembered a village of ramshackle buildings being reclaimed much too new to be ulven he remembered the torture and the sleepless nights he remembered things he wished he had never seen and would never see again ranmir woke slowly unable to speak his mouth too dry to form words the bonds had been lifted reyna fritha and rill stood by fritha handed him a bowl of water please drink this selena made this cleansed water she says it helped when she and stanrick came home sick from the swamp she wanted to help reyna fritha and rill had agreed that in her state it was safer to keep her away after a long drink ranmir spoke i am tired please cousin tell us what you have seen reyna requested this had become the order of things since the attack on rill ranmir simply replied when i am readybryech marched alongside the rest of the longfang warriors bracing himself against the bitter cold he looked around him as warriors from the stormjarl war packs marched next to the veteran longfang warriors and was filled with a strange feeling he was now one of the greenest members of the longfangs the other was orrin orrin was barely an adult and he was marching to battle the whole thing still didnt seem real to bryech he was in a way numb to the whole thing like it was routine even though all of this was new to him the sense of anger that had always fed his fights against the mordok was gone for now bryech felt different about this battle that he now marched to the people he would be fighting were people not beasts with only one purpose in life these battles would be different these battles would be remembered in history however bryech did not feel happy that he was going to be a part of it the mother and father are shamed bryech says to himself as he once again shrugs against the cold and keeps on marching toward war the first few days after graytir had announced the remaining neutrality of clan stormjarl were cold very cold the few fights that did break out were small skirmishes that resulted in almost no deaths like two wolf packs sizing each other up bryech had never felt this cold before he could feel it in his bones the stinging cold made everyone weary to fight it went on like that for weeks the longhouse of the village was now serving as a barracks for the stormjarl and longfang warriors the stormjarl militia were constantly moving in and out as warriors took up defensive positions the longfangs were constantly on watch the real fighting began two weeks after stormjarl neutrality was claimed it started with horns signaling enemy approach all of the warriors from pack longfang and clan stormjarl were ready and being deployed as the war leaders saw fit longfang warriors go cover the main road my warriors will assist and handle any flanking units one of the stormjarl chieftains yelled over the clamor of warriors preparing for battle the warriors jogged into their positions on the road bryech stood somewhere in the middle of the formation waiting bryech went to pull the gaias star out from underneath his armor and cursed himself he had left it in the barracks at onsallas village the horns sounded again this time even though the enemy could be seen the grimward forces outnumbered the stormjarl and longfang at almost two to one but that was no concern to the longfangs the grimward troops stopped about fifty yards from the longfang formation the two forces looked at each other neither unit saying anything bryech followed his instincts and started barking orders he wasnt their leader but he was getting sick of waiting shield wall bryech yelled his response was the sound of shields locking together and warriors taking their fighting stances the road formed a natural choke point just in front of the longfang formation the grimward war pack leaders started to bark out orders and on their side a shieldwall formed bryech was ready and he roared the rest of pack longfang joined in and their collective battle cry was fearsome the grimward responded with their own battle cry the grimward war pack leaders sounded for the charge seconds passed and the two walls crashed together the sounds of warriors fighting became deafening for the first few minutes the two lines fought warriors on both sides trading blows but so far none had fallen bryech watched from the rear line but he wanted in the fight but he was ordered to stay back until the front needed reinforcements watch above theyre trying to jump over to break the line orando hollered over the sounds of combat bryech looked up just in time to see a grimward fighter in the air heading straight towards him bryech flipped his javelin in his hand and hurled it the javelin made solid contact and punched right through the fighters ribcage bryech wasnt prepared for the grimward to keep falling and landing on him he was knocked over as the corpse had fallen back to the ground he rolled the body off of himself and stood up he surveyed the carnage and things were getting bloody with warriors from both sides suffering injuries the chaos and flurry of combat making the rest of the world blur out into nothing but warriors trading blows suddenly a warrior right in front of bryech fell back dead an arrow sticking through his eye bryech didnt waste a second he jumped into the open spot in the shield wall bryech roared and started hammering against the warrior in front of him while the spearman behind him took the opportunity to stab the grimward in the thigh the warrior fell with a scream of pain bryech kicked his shield off his chest and stabbed him in the gut after punching through the warriors leather breastplate bryech felt something solid hit him in the back of his exposed left shoulder and felt the blade of a sword slide across his hauberk he turned to his left and stabbed skewering his attacker through the throat a spray of blood gushed out and splashed against his arm and cheek falling back into line bryech sounded for the line to push forward with a resounding roar the longfang line crashed into the other line sending the grimward back suddenly to his right one of the longfang warriors roared and began smashing through the enemy line the grimward warriors cut at the raging longfang and stabbed him but it seemed like he couldnt feel it there were several arrows sprouting from his torso and his armor was rent open from dozens of slashes and weapon strikes he was well on his way to a warriors death but intended to tear into the enemy before he went down the line is broken push through orrin said bryech looked to his right to see his friend hook an enemys shield with his axe while azra stabbed him through the chest with a javelin suddenly harlok appeared to his right and grunted at him to push through with a nod bryech looked forward and kicked the shield of the warrior who had replaced his recently fallen opponent sending him back a few feet together bryech and harlok tackled the warrior so he couldnt get up bryechs sword had fallen out of his hand when he tackled his opponent bryech pulled his dagger while harlok punched the warrior in the face while deflecting a few attacks with his shield bryech slammed his dagger into his opponents neck warm blood gushing out onto his hands killing the warrior almost instantly harlok jumped forward and charged into the fray the two lines had broken and the battlefield was a mass of warriors clashing against each other bryech rushed in after harlok he looked to his left to see a grimward warrior was charging towards him bryech took a low stance and flipped the warrior over him with his shield turning around bryech saw that the grimward was already on his feet and having dropped his shield he swung his axe twohanded the axe buried itself into bryechs shield with a loud crunch the warrior pulled and knocked bryech off balance throwing bryechs shield with his back swing he gave bryech the chance to regain his balance bryech and the grimward warrior began circling each other bryech with his dagger was at a disadvantage to the grimward warriors axe but he knew what to do with a battlecry he rushed the warrior who in turn swung his axe just as bryech had hoped he would have bryech reached his left arm out and grabbed the axe by its wooden haft stooping his opponents swing the blade of the axe slammed into his upperarm causing bryech to cringe in pain bryech then plunged his dagger into his opponents torso breaking straight through his chainmail hauberk bryech let go of his dagger and the warrior sank to his knees bryech crouched in front of him the fighting had moved away from the two of them as the longfang line reformed whats your name bryech asked still holding the grimwards axe sven shieldsplitter the warrior replied blood pouring out of his mouth i can tell how you got the name bryech replied gruffly sven looked bryech in the eyes and nodded bryech replies to his nod in kind you fought well today sven shieldsplitter and the great wolfs ears ring with your name as we speak bryech tells sven putting out his arm sven returns the greeting i am bryech savagefang first and only son of davrik savagefang that is the name you will tell the great wolf when he asks who sent you to him on this day bryech tells sven sven nods barely conscious bryech pulls his dagger from svens torso and drops his axe as sven falls to the ground dead bryech get up here now we need to reform the line orrin yelled bryech looked up and nodded while grabbing his shield which had luckily landed next to his sword that he had dropped after grabbing his gear bryech rejoined the shieldwall what in the name of gaia were you doing azra asked him angrily one must always take the chance to honor his opponent bryech replied raaaaaggggghh harlok growled smiling bryech says see he agrees with me the first battle of the northernmost stormjarl settlement was a victory for the stormjarl and their longfang allies but eventually after numerous attacks by grimward and whiteoak forces the stormjarl line crumbled even with the help of the longfang warriors from there the warriors of pack longfang and stormjarl militia retreated to a secondary defensive line all warriors suffering from grievous wounds and infection their elite training and discipline maintained an organized retreat and kept the grimward warriors from overtaking them as the wounded and villagers were evacuated deeper into stormjarl territory bryech soon came to realize why the humans speak so badly of war for it is the worst thing imaginable people forced to kill people that they once called brother watching their friends die beside them war may make friendships stronger than the ties of family but it costs so much morethe other hunters grimward only ever sent scouts it made sense for all they knew the great road through the pass was the only way over the mountains that could accommodate an army but that didnt stop khulgar graytide from looking for another route an unguarded way into nightriver territory among the narrow unsteady paths the coywolves walk when time is more important than safety of course unguarded is a matter of perspective when one is discussing the low mountains the mordok may have learned to give the road a mileswide berth and do not venture into the wideopen space of the tundra but the foothills and valleys those dark tangled spaces are second only to the dirge swamp especially with the war distracting those who usually keep them at bay it takes a great deal of luck or skill to avoid them and if grimward does get lucky and find one of the paths that snake between mordok dens well then there are the others the hunters that did not seek food banning redscythe looked down from his perch at the scout party drawing near four ulven rather than the usual party of six their clothing torn and bloodstained in places  clearly they could have found a luckier path only one of them carrying a bow and he was almost out of arrows looking closely banning could see family markings on the scouts clothing and weapons all crests and colors hed seen before but none that he knew personally good the redscythes were part of grimward once some of them still are and banning hoped never to meet family on his patrol he had left his rucksack and one of his axes  the ice axe not leikn he wasnt an idiot  on a snarl of roots two trees over when he heard the grimwards coming as a sort of bait it was almost embarrassing how easily they took that bait heading straight to the bag without noticing the fresh pine sap oozing from the marks his climbing spurs left by the time they started scanning the trees for him it was too late the first small round stone to leave bannings sling landed squarely on the archers temple dropping him instantly their confusion at the sudden attack bought time to launch a second stone this one glancing off the leaders ear  stunning but not killing her the remaining two scouts rushed the tree clearly not expecting him to come down they were wrong calk boots can do quite a lot of damage to an ulven neck especially at the end of a long drop rolling out of the fall he drew leikn his fighting axe and made short work of the last mans knee and breastbone before the leader could draw herself back to her feet he closed with her and  seeing the string of phalanges she wore around her neck  turned his axe crushing her skull with the hammer side not the blade looking around banning sighed and cleaned the blood off his axe the easy part was done and much faster than he had expected these four would meet the great wolf soon but not immediately he removed the bandages from the older wounds the mordok had given them and pulled a few items from his rucksack a few extra blows with a chipped and rusty scimitar here some scuffed up leaves there he broke the archers bow and buried the scimitar in his skull obliterating the mark from the sling stone tossed a few shards of a broken shield near the grimward with a mangled neck he did not quite have the stomach to make the scene look much more like a mordok attack than that even in the case of the leader with the fingerbone necklace but that was all right night was coming and the still notvoice in the back of his head told him the coyotes would finish the job in a few hours well enough that khulgar would not be made aware of the coywolf hunting party intercepting their scouts in the unlikely event another party made it in this far not even the longfang warriors stationed near edanas pass quite realized what the hunting party was doing banning and the others left the settlement with a group of hunters who actually were after food perhaps they thought this excursion was just a bunch of trappers and that ifor bloodskin was a passive champion biding his time in the longhouse until the conflict either spilled onto his doorstep again or ioan hindsblood was magically returned without a scratch on him whatever they thought it didnt matter what mattered is the back ways and deer paths through the mountains remained open to bring supplies to the watchwolves and closed to any grimward incursion the fewer people who knew what a farce their neutrality was the better as banning changed out of his heavy boots and spurs into a pair of swift turnshoes a few flakes of snow began to fall from the sky it was time for him to move on leaving a trail away from the fight would be counterproductive and if he didnt make it to the rendezvous point in a few hours his shieldsiblings would worry they were beginning to pull back to the pass  soon the mountains would be so choked with snow that their patrol would be redundant it was time to go home and see firsthand what the past month had brought to the rest of the packeverspring spirtclaw territory a week before midwinter the little bell tingles as i enter the shop its a smaller shop but there is a lot of bins and containers packed with dried ingredients giving off aromas both fine and foul the small building serves as both a tea shop and an apothecarys storefront i came here alone as i really didnt want stanrick to know what i was doing here there was a lot about today that i dont want him knowing about but this bit i knew would only make him angry truth be told i am not sure i am really okay with what i am doing here i pull out a container from my shoulder bag and stare at the bulk containers i know the recipe every female knows the recipe passed down from mother to daughter for as long as anyone can remember my mother and i had that talk shortly after i got my fangs its two parts dry juniper berries to one part wormwood and some mountain mint to help mask the piney taste that the juniper berries can have if they were harvested too early we all know its not a guarantee but its a time honored recipe that can help prevent pregnancy especially during that week when a female is in heat i can feel my week about to start i have had the warning sign that craving where you just want to be with your mate and i am getting easily distracted i will sit and stare into the fire but not really be thinking about anything its disconcerting even though i know what it is my scent hasnt changed yet but i know that is going to happen soon and i have to admit i am nervous about that i have been lucky so far as every month that it has happened i have been in the midst of traveling alone or have been too injured to really notice this is going to be the first month that we are going to be together and not injured we already are way more active than most ulven our age should be so i am really unsettled i take a deep breath and start to measure out the amounts even though i know its a good idea i am still torn i am not even sure i can still have children so the notion that i am trying to prevent an event of nature is weighing on me i am torn between my duty as a truthseeker and my duty as a female i fear bringing children into the middle of this war even though my father traveled with me and my brother we still had my mother and my grandmother with us and our only concern was mordok now i must stand against mordok outsiders and even other ulven when i travel with stanrick as my only companion i fear losing the children to outsiders or even worse other ulven i am not the best fighter and the notion that i could only save one or the other keeps me up at night the great wolf would eat me for bringing the children into known danger yet gaia curses me for preventing her path though i also know that if it is my destiny to have children with stanrick gaia will make sure it happens with or without the tea i place the container on counter the old woman double checking my measurements as i offer her some of the dried deer meat in exchange for the tea i step into the cold streets making sure the door is secure behind me we are about half way through lunas season while i have a strong connection to luna i tire of seeing her mate the winter wolf the bitter cold he has brought with him this season is brutal we have had quite a few elderly and some of the refugees die due to the cold i know most of the other clans tend to view the seasons as a pack of wolves my clan tends to divide the seasons up by the first pack winter is controlled by luna since she is the most affluent as the nights get longer spring is the great wolfs season its first time in months that we are able to hunt and replenish our meat supplies it was also according to the epics the time that gaia and the great wolf first mated summer is of course controlled by sol there is a little reddish brown wolf that is said to run with sol though her name is unknown as she likes to hide it is said that if you look carefully through the waves of heat that raise from the land during a midsummer festival you can spot her watching its suppose to give you good luck if you can see her autumn is controlled by gaia as we give her thanks for the bounty that she has nurtured for us throughout the spring and summer i pull my hood down over my ears tighter as i weave my way through the streets i stop before the jewelers and enter a male slightly younger than me smiles as i enter selena its been ages since i seen you he smiles yes it has sten i smile back sten was my fathers cousins son we normally only saw them during pack moots he has been a gifted jeweler since before his marks came in he designed my last mates gift when he was eighteen sten smirks at me i figured you would be stopping by sooner or later i heard keres challenged him when you all first got here i sigh yeah and she got her butt thoroughly handed to her too i dont know what she was thinking challenging a veteran warrior let alone a veteran longfang he giggles yeah he pulls out a black cloth and lays it on the counter so i have the base piece done  he pulls out from under the counter a talisman made of bronze the shape is of a wolf slightly bent down in front like it is about to sprint to take off after something i am going to put detail in the head and on the rump i smile i love it  i dig in my hip pouch for a second and toss him a silver coin these any use to you i ask the outsiders say they are valuable and they trade them like we trade meat but i cant figure out why considering their value seems to change more then i change my socks sten looks at the coin carefully and takes a little jewelers hammer to it and listens to it resonate yeah i can melt this down and make a pair of earrings or pendant out of it its mostly silver i nod finally something practical that can be done with them he nods ill have it done before the midwinter ceremony come back in a couple days  stanrick was sitting in the training yard smoking his pipe he had once again beat the tar out of keres and not even broken a sweat she lay on the ground and every muscle refused to move he watched the other guards careful not to stare for too long in fear that they would be the next to fall  at this point thats all this was to him anymore and the few veterans that had been town guards started to use his methods on the younger guards your pups really do this every day at onsallas asked conrad spritclaw every day most ulven they are tradesmen first then they are warriors second then there are warriors who work a trade as well longfang warriors are only warriors that is their trade their hobby and their life he watched the guards train conrad was the warrior that was tasked with training the young guards the first day stanrick had shown up with selena conrad had watched keres honor duel with stanrick and felt ashamed at the fact she lost as bad as she did it left a bad taste in his mouth and the next morning he had told stanrick the same thing he told all the warriors that came to train if you want to train here you fight me first the grin on stanricks face was perhaps the most unsettling thing about the fight guards and villagers alike were drawn to the spectacle a small ring of observers gradually swelling into a crowd half an hour into the match both warriors had resorted to brawling in the mud their wooden swords splintered and their shields shattered growing exhausted conrad eventually conceded the match the two became fast friends after that when you put it that way no wonder i couldnt get a upper hand i will be honest i was a little afraid when you started laughing when your shield broke conrad scratched his head and he laughed nervously oh i never said that was my way of life i think there is more to gaias path the killing mordok dont feel any shame in our fight you were doing fine till we hit the mud then my smaller size is the only thing that saved me stanrick grinned conrad got up and went back to training the guards but stanrick stayed seated puffing away do you plan to get up some time today keres he asked looking past her to the gate nope im fine here the mud feels great on my face she stated as she rubbed her face back and forth in the mud pool i am so glad you are only a town guard i would hate to have you in my shield wall stanrick glared down at her i had a long night last night she muttered into the ground so did i but you dont see me on the ground he replied i dont want to know she yelled muffled by the ice covered ground stanrick smiled and continued to smoke away when he saw a younger girl enter the gate it was brigit she held a hot teacup and sipped away at it as she walked up she smiled and waved at stanrick mother said you would be kicking keres butt so i thought i would come down and watch the show she said with a smile go away brigit im not in the mood to deal with you keres tried to get up but she could not get her legs to work stanrick shook his head you can stay your sister is learning life lessons brigit sat down and watched the young males fighting in the yard stanricks thoughts deepened as his senses were now picking up on things he normally would ignore with females their age but it was now painfully obvious that the sisters like their cousin were in heat and brigit was here to watch the males she had a little grin on her face as she watched one of the boys with dark black hair who was showing off and was clearly top of his class stanrick could you do me a favor brigit said quietly as she sipped her tea maybe what do you want stanrick ask carefully that boy is jornel solfire would you fight him for me i want to see if he is all he claims to be she kept staring youre not going to be happy when he is in worse shape than your sister stanrick said as he watched jornel take down his opponent he took a drink of water then walked over past keres oh look the bitch doing what she does best laying on her back he didnt get too far before he walked into stanrick he locked eyes and he tried to make himself look tough but it had no effect on stanrick jornel i think you need some more training he said quietly as he grabbed the young male by the collar of his tabard and dragged him to the center of the ring everyone gathered quickly to see what was about to happen but no one could have imagined what stanrick did as jornel took a swing with his ax stanrick let go of his shield and grabbed the ax handle dragging the boy in close to him jornels eyes grew as large as plates stanrick rolled him around and put the wood blade to his throat whispering in his ear never say or think anything that disrespectful again or it wont a wooden sword next time am i clear jornel made a small nod then stanrick kicked him down in the mud then stormed off back to his table boys like that are not worth your time brigit he said as he picked up a mug of mead oh i didnt have any interest in him i like the boy that he was fighting he is really good at wood carving she said looking at a young blonde boy who had yellow eyes she smiled at stanrick and finished her tea but i see what selena sees in you youre not just a mean longfang so i wont tell anyone what you did for keres fair enough by the way what is with the mint tea brigit blushed a bright red im flattered but your mated with selena i didnt think i would have got your attention what i asked about tea for the love of gaia she blinked at him a few times oh rightnot from here well see it is a special tea for females when wellmost of the time when a male points it out it means they have some interest in the female because we all know what its for the mint kills the taste of the junipers honestly im nervous ive never mated before and i think its better if i dont have a pup yet stanrick looked off past the gate and he felt his heart sink a little something wrong stanrick brigit asked he looked to her and he twitched a small smile dont worry about me i will be okay just dont rush your choice make sure your mate is worth your time he said with a smile brigit nodded and smiled got up and made her way to the blond boy ok i get the point stanrick i need to make sure i can fight at any time i promise i will be better tomorrow keres had gotten up and slowly made her way to the table i wont be here tomorrow so unless youre on duty just take some time for your self besides you cant really enjoy some old warrior beating you up every day she stops and looked at him confused i may not always be around to protect selena i want to be sure that she is protected when i go back home he sipped his mead keres sat down across from him still confused you can lie to brigit but i think she was right something is bugging you why would you ever leave selena she tilted her head i dont want to but with this war i may have to my shield brothers fight grimward as we speak in stormjarl territory i dont know why i am not with them but i could be told to go in a moments notice your cousin needs more than a staff if i go i would like it if you would keep an eye on her yeah i can still beat you but i think you can take any of the other guards here and i know you can pound jornel into dust she smiled that means a lot coming from you stanrick you should go see selena if i know her she probably misses you stanrick just nodded he finished his mead and started to walk back to the drunk uncle  i swear ive been staring at this same page now since i opened the book hours ago i sigh exasperated and pick up my mug to take a drink i turn back to the book trying to force myself to focus on what is on the page apparently i failed at that again as i am jolted out of my trance by a sharp pain in my hand as the mug goes flying across the room my head snaps to the side as i try to find the what just slap the drink from my hand stanrick stands there his hair matted down with a cross between sweat and melting snow he is still in his cloak and armor he must have just come back from training the guards his scent fills my nose and i shut my eyes tight for a moment to try and stomp down my instincts what was that for i frown as i salvage the book from getting wet you werent going to tell me he states at me he doesnt yell there is a twinge in his voice though that tells me he is upset i stop and look at him there is a hurt look to his eyes and i wrinkle my forehead in confusion  tell you what i ask carefully your cousin reminded me what the tea was for i saw her with the exact same mixture when she stopped by the training ring today i knew i had recognized the smell but i wasnt sure since you add mint to your version stanrick stated i snarl i am going to beat keres i wasnt keres it was brigit  stanrick corrected i stand there dumbfounded for a moment as the angry momentum i had is suddenly lost i couldnt be mad at brigit this is probably her first season using the tea and if stanrick asked of course she would tell him what its for since he isnt from our pack i blink at stanrick i really dont know what to say i thought you knew what the tea was to be honest you have had many more mates than i and i figured some of them had to have used a version of this tea before  he nods some of them have ive seen other longfang females use it too after battles before they decide who they are going to mate with that night this is different though he looks me in the eye we are life matesdont i get a say in if we have children i can feel my mouth slack open as my jaw drops a little i inhale sharply as i wrap my arms under my chest and turn from him i go sit on the edge of the bed and look at the floor unable to look at him i know he is right he should have a say i just didnt think he had shown no interest in sirens upbringing nor any of his children as far as all the stories i heard so i figured he didnt care i justi thought i stammer i stop and take a big breath i am conflicted i am torn between my job as a truthseeker and my duty as a female i am afraid to bring children into the middle of this war it used to be all we had to worry about was mordok now we have to worry about them outsiders and our fellow ulven the thought that should something go wrong and i could only save you or my childit keeps me up at night  i see stanrick take off his cloak and armor and he sits next to me on the bed you didnt really have a hand in sirens upbringing or that of your other children i didnt think you cared about children so it didnt cross my mind to ask i stare at my hands in my lap my lack in sirens up bringing is not as much as she would have you think i was always there for my pups when their mothers let me they were my children after all i taught my son all i could he takes a deep breath our children will have a mother who wont pass her young off to others and wants to be a part of their lives he puts his arms around her between your family and us i know we wont have a spoiled daughter who thinks everyone left her because her stepmother died in childbirth youre not wrong in your thinking i just wish you would have talked to me i am sorry beloved i whisper he tilts my chin up so i have to look at him he leans in and kisses me softly i know you are he smiles back at me i lean in and kiss him againtired of fighting my instincts  bowmen stood at the bar getting things ready for the evening rush selena and stanrick had been fighting for over an hour but they finally seem to be making up he was happy that selena finally found another mate he was worried about her after she lost her family to the lich two years ago even though they are still learning about each others customs and ways of life bowmen knows that itll be rough but thinks they will make it they seem resourceful like that and truly in love with each other bowmen looks up at the sound of the tingling of bells a small female that he doesnt recognized enters he would put her at selena age short brown hair and brown and burnt orange clothes long heavy wool cloak she has the composure of a longfang he thinks as he watches her study the place for a moment welcome he smiles is this where a truthseeker and a longfang are staying she asks bowmen frowns it is why do you ask she smiles becoming excited i am the longfangs cousin my name is reyna longfang he should know that i was coming i sent him a message are they here bowmen nods yeah theyre upstairsbut i he trails off as he watches the young woman bound up the stairs bowmen leans on the bar and slowly starts to count backwards from 5 321 bowmen thinks stanrick longfang for the love of gaia i know you know how to use a latch reyna shrieks from upstairs and a door slams bowmen start chuckling uncontrollably as reyna comes back down stairs eyes a little wide and cheeks burning red bowmen pulls a brass key from under the counter i tried to warn you this is for the first room at the top of the stairs dont worry there is a room in between you and them they do go at it quite a bit just so you are warned  reyna takes the key from him and nods ill get you guys some mead i am sure you guys have a lot to talk aboutespecially now bowmen snickers trying not to laugh as he goes in back and gets a pitcher and some mugs he comes back out with a tray and sets in on the bar as he sees stanrick come down the stairs obviously having gotten dressed in a hurry damnit reynait helps when you include when you are expecting to show up in your letters stanrick growls bowmen is still trying to stifle laughing meads on the house  bowmen walks into the kitchen to start dinner prep while the kids talk it out up front  midwinters eve bowman was not kidding you two are nonstop said reyna as she followed stanrick down one of the side roads she had some shopping to do stanrick agreed to take her around the town to get everything she need we are not that bad stanrick pulled his hood over his head to keep in the warmth nonstop you remember that week you met mina yeah more times last night then that week i saw this cute couple yesterday clearly in their prime they have nothing on you do you even sleep at night they turned down an ally found the store reyna was looking for yeah we sleep you just showed up at a strange time okay he muttered she stopped at the door and looked at stanrick oh my sweet mother youre trying for a pup she said with a child like grin what no i we okay maybe i am but i dont know why stanrick muttered as he reached for the door reyna stopped him and pulled him off to the side what is there not to know she was in heat and you are dealing with others in heat all day add the fact you care about her i can see why you would want to have a pup with her she is a much better choice than senna she didnt seem to care about pups she is much prettier too so did you have a joining yet reyna was now really excited about all of this joining no i never put much thought into it he looked out across the streets well you should you are lifemates you said so yourself is it wrong to ask gaia to bless the path you both walk just think about it okay she opened the door to the shop and walked in stanrick looked at the tunics but saw nothing he liked he only had three changes of clothing in his bag and yawn ripped his fourth shirt reyna looked at bolts of fabric so what did you get her for midwinter she asked as she checked the weight of the cloth im giving her my first sword she needs something to keep her safe if im not there im not using it any more anyway he looked at the pattern on the fabric and gave her a simple shrug stanrick longfang you really can be sweet when you want to im sure she will love it i am getting this one i think i can make a nice dress with it or something she went over to the shopkeeper and began to haggle with her it did not take her long she took the bolt and went for the door lets go stanrick i have what i needed stanrick followed her and they put up their hoods to keep out the cold everywhere they looked houses had evergreen branches and wreaths decorating the houses for midwinter they really go all out here over midwinter dont they she asked him clan spritclaw has a deep connection with the first pack and show reverence to all our gods not just gaia and the great wolf midwinter is lunas night so it is more than just a celebration of the nights getting shorter i wish more clans would pay attention to what this holiday is really about stanrick was always a devout believer and this time in spritclaw had reaffirmed things he already knew not that he would stop selena from explaining her beliefs but his mother had taught him much about gaia the great wolf and the first pack solvig had expanded on her teachings by telling him stories that most ulven did not know such as how gaia taught the great wolf how to change so what is the true meaning behind midwinter asked reyna oh i have no idea but i think it has something to do with stars selena told me about how if a pup dies before their marks they go live with luna mother said something to that effect when solfie passed but i never put much thought in it till now he stopped in the street and looked at the night sky already there were more stars out then he could count even back home do you ever remember this many stars over the last two years the number of stars in the night sky has only grown i think she is right he started to walk again not waiting for reyna she was still looking up at the stars when she realized that he was about 20 feet away she ran to get to him there were fewer people on the streets tonight than stanrick had come to expect a few guards walked down the street and simply nodded a greeting to stanrick he reached the front door of the drunk uncle he opened the door and saw selena and brigit working on a project what are you doing he asked  what are you guys doing stanrick asks as he walks into the inn reyna following behind him today i had brigit over to help me construct our sky lanterns we were all spread out over one of bowmens downstairs tables making lanterns for everyone making sky lanterns for the rite tomorrow i state oh what rite reyna asks intrigued tomorrow is midwinter the longest night of the year it is the night that luna is at her most powerful its also the night that the veil between realms is supposed to be at its thinnest seers have an easier time with their trade those that have lunas gift supposedly are given visions the rite not only honors luna as a seer but also acknowledges the children that are living with her in her realm the children act as messengers between this realm and the next we send messages to them and they take the messages to our loved one that have passed brigit explains i nod correct since the veil is suppose to the thinnest this time of year my clan constructs what is known as sky lanterns to take our messages and thoughts up to the unseen realm so the children and those that have passed on there know they are not forgotten isnt that interfering with their journey reyna frowns at me i blink at her for a moment and tilt my head a little surprised i frown no they are where they need to be we are not pulling them back here or taking them off their path would you insult the hawks for delivering messages between two ulven think of the lanterns as hawks this is the only time of year that we can send messages to this place reyna seems to dwell on this for a moment we all have people we miss for one night a year we can say something to them and know that we will be heard i sigh stanrick walk up to me and looks at the table alrighthow does one make one of these  stanrick reyna and i stand huddled around one of the braziers that have been place around the steps leading to the clan leader halls i frown a little as i look around normally this rite gets people from the entire territory but the turn out seems to be sparse this year i am hoping its just the cold and the snow that is keeping everyone in their own villages the buildings and streets around the settlement have been adorned with holly witch hazel and evergreen branches balls its cold i hear stanrick curse under his breath as he warms his hands at the fire high priestess morrigan walk out on to the steps of the clan leaders halls she is adorned in a long forest green wool robe on top of her head is a wreath of the rare white holly like the moon flower in summer it is said that the berries contain the essence of luna it is said only priestesses know how to extract this essence and its use to help with vision quests or other scrying techniques as morrigan rings a large ornate brass gong the crowd fall silent and turns their heads towards her tonight we honor luna the seer of the first pack and sister to the great mother through her keen sight and benevolent touch she raised the fallen children of our clan to the sky and imparted some of her glory unto them so they may find names for themselves in unseen realms before returning to be with our loved ones in the great forest tonight when the veil between realms is at its thinnest we offer up our thought and prayers to our deceased family and friends and hope the children can do their duties proudly and with honor so they may return home morrigan proclaims proudly her voice carrying over the crowd she makes a little motion with her hand and henrick the clanleaders son comes forward with a sky lantern clearly his own handiwork as shown by the pictures crudely drawn on the outside of the paper morrigan carefully takes the lantern from him she chants blessing the lantern before she lights it and lets it go i repeat the chant as well lighting our little lanterns and soon the sky start to fill with little lights floating towards the sky h a s k fr minn h a s k mr mna og brr mnir og systr mnar h a s k lnu jar minnar aftur til og  byrjun lo kalla eir til mn eir bja mr a taka sti mitt  meal eirra  rjrinu vi

watching the light float higher and higher do you think they will get our messages he asks i sigh and lean my head on his shoulder i am sure they will reyna looks at me and frowns can you teach me that prayer its old ulven correct i nod  its basically a prayer honoring our ancestors but yeah i can teach you  the three of us sit downstairs in the inn after the ceremony stanrick and i are curled up on the couch and renya is regaling me with a tale about about when she stanrick harlock and someone named ranmir were trying to steal supplies from of the towers of the outpost for some sort of shenanigans bowmen comes out and requests my aid in helping prep for tomorrows breakfast the pain in his hands was starting to get too much for him he is having trouble kneading the bread reyna said she would help to help pay for her room and goes and disappears into the kitchen i turn to stanrick the apothecary wasnt the only place i stopped the day i got the tea i did make one other stop stanrick frowns at me oh i reach my hand into my waist pouch i had been carrying it all day looking for a good time to give it to him i take his hand and place in it the talisman that sten made along with a matching brass chain i have been trying to think of something fitting for you since we meet something i could give you so you could have a piece of me with you always my cousin sten is a brilliant jeweler and helped design it its seemed most fitting to give it to you on midwinter stanrick smiles and kisses me i love it that reminds me stanrick runs upstairs for a moment and comes back down holding a long covered item i found it in our things i know its not mine he states i uncover it to find a sword i grab the hilt its not horribly balanced from what i can tell though its been twenty years since ive held a sword i study the blade there are a few dings in it saying its been used at some point and it could use a good oil and sharpening its been sitting for awhile but other than that its a perfectly useable sword i sigh exasperated is it one of yawns did he leave his things at your place again and we grabbed it when we packed the cart to come here stanrick laughs no love its yours i blink what stanrick smiles its yours it was my first sword but i cant use it anymore its too short for me but its the right length for you your clan isnt the only one who will occasionally exchange gifts for midwinter i am about to smack him with the flat of the sword when i think better of it i frown a little you know i havent wielded a sword in 20 years  stanrick nods i know ill teach you after the swampyour staff just isnt going to cut it anymore hun i sigh and look at the sword funny stanrick leans in and kisses me dont worry what better person to teach you i smirk assuming you can focus on the lessons with me about i lean in and kiss him back oh for the love of gaia will you guys knock it off i swear you two act like you just got your marks or something reyna states coming back into the room bowmen needs help racking a new batch of mead he could use all of us hell let us taste test it if we help  early february selena you been summoned by the clan leader i hear keres yell from downstairs i pull my hair back into a tail as i come down the stairs any idea on what about i ask nope keres shrugs stanrick and i enter the great hall and was told that the clan leader was waiting for me in his study cahal you wished to see me i state as i enter yes i received word that there is a meeting of the people in nightriver territory to talk about the war and each clans place in it i want you to go in my stead most other clan leaders are not going themselves i think they are using this to feel each other out  cahal announces to me i blink a few times i am just your eyes and ears i have no authority to speak as a voice  i state you do now you have a good grasp on what is good for the clan you have had a sense about what is wrong with this war you now have the opportunity to voice it cahal states plainly i frown not sure what to think about this cahal turns to stanrick i am officially hiring you and your cousin to be her bodyguards for this selena is more than just a truthseeker for this mission she is my voice as well i have already sent word to solvig and she is going to be sending one more to meet up with you on the road there cahal said stanrick was just as shocked as i was about this but we agreed and made preparations to leave post haste even reyna seemed out of sorts by they speed of it all but fell in line quickly and seemed to appreciate being able to spend some time with her cousin i wondered if this was the first time they had officially had a mission together  the dinner didnt go as i had expected there were a lot of outsiders there which was unnerving to me this is suppose to be our war and theywell some of them anywayshave this idea in their heads that they need to be the ones to stop it im not sure i like that i sat by the fire at camp as we made our way back towards spirtclaw territory reyna stanrick and the guard sat and talked by the fire while i tried to formulate the letter i was sending ahead of me  clan leader cahal the dinner went off fine you were correct in the notion that most clans dont know what they are doing with the exception of a few goldenfield threw their lot in with nightriver and riverhead said that they were going to do what was best for gaia and continue to fight mordok as they always have shattered spear was silent i am a little concerned that they didnt send anyone most were too skittish to make a solid claim as you were correct in the thought that they are still feeling each other out some were looking to advance their own needs i will fill you in on details upon my return after hearing what is going on in stormjarl i started talks with our neighboring clans to try and get them to at least support each other even if they didnt want to support the war i would hate to see what is happening in stormjarl happen somewhere else steinjotunn is the most favorable to the idea of neutrals banding together ironmound was a maybe i was unable to talk to squallborn though i was hoping to confirm or deny the rumor i heard that they had hand in helping grimward and whiteoak i made a plea to remember tradition although i fear it fell on deaf ears stanricks speech about honor had more of an effect than mine did i am still a little unnerved on how good he can be with words things almost got bad when one of the humans decided to grab me and shake me she was frustrated that it seemed that there was nothing they could do and was tired of us treating them like children i sympathize with her but one person cannot speak for their entire group it seems they have so many others making them look bad once she saw three ulven stand hand on their weapons she quickly apologized and things calmed down the dinner wrapped up quickly after that all in all i dont think anything got solved and that makes me fear for our future i will make a full report when i return truthseeker selena stargazer  i fold up the paper and seal it for transport on the next hawk i findletters in the wind ylsa began writing as soon as the expedition stopped to rest scratching words onto paper by dull firelight while the rest of the party stood guard or slept or tore their cloaks into bandages for stanricks wounds as soon as the party made it back to onsallas outpost she sent her messages into the wind a very young longfang volunteered himself as one of the fastest runners in the pack she sent him to follow the phoenix caravan bearing this brief note written while selena stargazer yelled and extorted promises from thrand the first night of the return journey honored laertes and aiden our mission was successful but the document we sought was stolen before it could be examined keep those fine ears of yours in the wind for any sign of them also as you may have learned on you own by now the symbol you were inquiring about is mark of the pack stormjarl chieftain ylsa next she saw a familiar messenger hawk perched atop her tent as if waiting for her return to that birds leg she tied this tightlyfolded piece of paper bearing a message scrawled out while the rest of the party divvied up the last of the food and water on the second day of the return journey one i have reason to believe that the pirates of oarsmeet are very soon going to be selling a book or some other form of document they found in the dirge swamp if you would like to keep the original for some perverse reason fine i only ask that i and one of my associates be allowed to handle it and transcribe its contents i will pay you i will continue to provide you with information just get me the book i do not care where the pirates are i do not care if agnosco is who they are selling it to in the first place just find me the book ylsa stormherald finally a weathered old ulven hunter began the walk towards the watchwolves of sol with this letter  composed during ylsas turn watching stanrick in case he stopped breathing in his sleep the night before they returned to the outpost  carefully rolled and hidden in her boot dearest raskolf the expedition into the dirge swamp fared far better than most expected but not as well as hoped the mercenaries betrayed us and were slaughtered to a man whether this was treachery by the new aldorian prince or whether the mercenaries were secretly under the employ of a third party i do not know most of the volunteers who ventured in have made it back out again despite this treachery although i fear stanrick may not last long despite our best efforts silvermane gave his life to save rhodi a group of boomhowlers bastards and myself when we became separated from the rest of the group  may the great wolfs ears ring with his name as to whether or not the mission was actually successful it depends on your point of view our truth seekers divinations led us near to a vilely corrupted site so i am told  i did not see it myself and at that site we found a small chest containing a few silver and gems but the book we sought was nowhere to be found just before we found the chest the two oarsmeet pirates traveling with us disappeared and just after the seekers magic told her the thing she sought was moving such a coincidence is too great to have been an accident i could be mistaken but for now there is no doubt in my mind that the pirates took what we were seeking and left to try and sell it to whom i have no idea but what i do know is that the pirates seem to be somehow blessed with magnificent luck and a party of two is harder to find in the woods than a whole expedition there is a very good chance that the item or items they took made it out of the swamp intact i intend to make contact with the agnosco network  if anybody will be able to find the information we need it will be them assuming they are not the ones the pirates sell it to in the first place also the day before the expedition began two of the phoenix syndar approached me regarding a large goldwood claimant found in the swamp some months ago they did not know where it had come from or whom it belonged to and neither did i last i heard were attempting to arrange a meeting with solveig longfang to discuss it since this conversation i have learned that it bore the mark of the chief of pack stormjarl  it seems likely to me that they were attempting to contact longfang and met with misfortune on the way keep your ears up for any news may you ever hunt downwind ylsa ps tell anjan and lygari that i spoke with the strange blackskinned syndar once more she described another one of her friends to me  another syndar living in the swamp one that knows the mordok a pale mean syndar she said to tell him she has a present for him id love to think that present was my blade but knowing her its probably an interestingly shaped rock  at least in the voice she spoke to me in her other voice is more vicious either way it eases my heart to hear of him i had begun to fear that what i saw when i was captured was just my fevered imagination knowing that there is another who has seen him even if that other has a fractured mind soothes me greatly there were other letters sent out that day brief missives cryptically seeking word of the stolen journal passed from hand to hand among the kind of people who learn and tell stories like the rest of us breathe the air but these are the ones ylsa stormherald will remember writingits big i hear stanrick mumble under his breath as we stand on top of hill in the road so he can get a clear view from here we can see the healers hall the clanleaders halls and the four foot stone wall with its large wooden burgwall perched atop it  a reinforced fence around the settlement complete with watchtowers jutting from the wood every thirty feet or so i shrug saying such a fortified place isnt something you think of when you think of my clan i know    especially considering our highest ideals are knowledge and learning not warfare the wall around the city has been there as long as anyone can remember nobody is sure when it was built but we keep it in good repair if its there we may as well use it i take his hand starting back down the road rambling about the history of the area everspring is built on the largest hill here the settlement sprung up around the natural hot springs and the safety of the hill didnt hurt our territory is a mix of everything the land has to offer  weve access to the great forest to the north and thats where the stargazer holdings are it opens up into rolling fields to the south  thats where we are now smiling faintly i continue not as fertile as goldenfields but enough to supply us with food the land gets rockier the further south you get  good enough to hold a few mines pack windwalker mines salt from the walls of howling cove seeing stanrick perk up at that i pick up a bit how they mine the salt is how they got their name i should take you there come spring its quite a sight our main trade with other clans is the truthseekers  our knowledge of the the laws used to be sought after by a lot of clans i said a bit of pride creeping into my voice most of my fellow seekers are off studying the same thing i am though this war has us all scrambling trying to understand i sigh a little though for physical goods its salt to preserve food stone clay and gems to those that dont have good mining land our clan is made of 5 packs the story is that pack spritclaw pack stargazer and pack solfire are all related spirtclaw and stargazer were brother and sister  some say they were twins  and solfire was a cousin the founders joined forces to defeat what we believe to be an emanation of the corruption at the springs and they formed the core of the clan the smaller packs of windwalkers and cloudwatcher joined later  coastal lands that joined stanrick looks at me like i have lost my mind and i sigh sorry he stops and kisses my forehead everything will be fine he states as we near the gates i watch as stanrick eyes the refugee tents off to the left of the gates they have been here long enough now that they have even erected a spiked fence made from logs around their camp site i frown as i look at the gates im nervous and i dont like it im home  i should be happy but yet all i feel is weariness stanrick tugs my hand lets go love standing out here isnt going to make it easier we enter the main gates passing by one of the larger wells i can feel people turning to look at me as i walk past my blue gambeson and ravenheaded torc giving away both my clan and my job i can see people leaning in and whispering to each other as i pass hand in hand with stanrick i set my eyes to the smoothed path in front of me helping stanrick pull the sled across the stones  had i been thinking i would have attached the wheels so it would behave like a cart before we entered the settlement stanrick looks up and around at the houses and structures as we pass they vary in size depending how big a family is living there most of the houses are wooden in construction fortified and strengthened against the winter with stone or fired clay brick the clans tradition is to build two floors  though the first is normally sunken into the earth a few feet to help keep cool in the summer and warmer in the winter and to aid in storing grains and dry goods over the long winters with their thatched or wooden roofs theyre another reminder of what ive left  theres nothing nearly so elaborate at onsallas we pass by the main square where more refugees have set up and i can see stanricks hand rest nervously on his sword i show him down a path off the main square and stop before a communal house  close to the humans inns but with promises of work and hospitality rather than money walking past the familiar handpainted sign declaring it to be the drunken uncle i help pull the sled to the back of the building and into one of the storage sheds well take out what we need and can come back for the rest later you dont have a house here stanrick asks as he tucks his extra armor under his arm and a pack over his shoulder no i am not allowed one i state as dig out my packs and hike them on my shoulder he frowns at me i am still an active truthseeker i get sent all over the place it used to be to help settle disputes over territory lines or to help a chieftain research a problem because he cant see an unbiased view of the issue im not here often enough to make having a home practical if i ever get taken off of active duty then i can have a home maybe i say we walk around back to the front and up the small steps to the door which i push open the warmth of the room washing over us as we step in its quite large with a heavy stone hearth in the back holding a nice warm fire the bar sits off to the left a dozen seats set before it and the room is scattered with about five or six tables there is a door to the right of the bar that i know leads off to the spacious kitchen with its brick ovens and large cooking fire as well as the part that would interest stanrick the most  large casks of mead and wine ready to be tapped for thirsty warriors furs and tapestries hang from the walls in the main area and a set of stairs head up from just to the left of the hearth i hear rustling in the kitchen as a older male walks out behind the bar he is not a little man with the physique of a warrior that has long since retired from the front lines in his late 50s with gray creeping into his closelycropped brown hair  a habit he still hasnt given up from his fighting days even if his long mustache and beard both need a good trim his eyes light up as when he sees me coming around the bar he pulls me into a huge bear hug before i could even say anything unbidden tears begin stinging my eyes  more than anything else here now i feel like i am home bowmen was a close with my father often acting as his bodyguard back before my parents met they both defended the walls when the mordok came in force to everspring  he was my fathers best friend the father i never knew i had after my family had died it was bowmen who picked me up off his tavern floor when i stumbled in he put me to work taking care of me and making sure i didnt lose myself to grief keres shared the letter with me about what had happened to you in the black you have had everyone worried child he scolded me as he hugs me tightly sorry i mumble into his tunic he holds me out at arms length looking me over checking for wounds and the like satisfied he finally notices stanrick they stand there for a while silently sizing each other up in the way only warriors can do stanrick longfang warrior of pack longfang stanrick finally says breaking the silence hold out his arm bowmen eyes it for a moment before clasping his wrist bowmen spirtclaw pack spritclaw i am assuming you were charged to guard selena by your pack elder stanrick nods i was i wasnt about to complain either i can see bowmen raise an eyebrow at that as he smirks a little yes bowmen stanrick and i are mates i finally sigh i could see him putting the pieces together already bowmen smiles broadly and i can hear the sarcasm creep into his voice no you dont say  i glare at him and he laughs heartily the same bowmen from my childhood it was about time child he says walking back behind the bar so what has brought you back i was expecting to hear word back from the clanleader about my next move after i came out of the black i didnt receive anything so once i was well enough to travel again i came home is there anything wrong here i ask bowmen frowns saying nothing out of the ordinary as far as i am aware we are still getting refugees maybe two or three a month some of the clans daughters have set up a kitchen in the square to help feed them theyre trying to pull their weight and be good guests while in our territory some of those who want to be warriors help with patrols and keeping everyone calm others help cook in the refugee kitchen they even go out to try hunting and fishing to help offset the burden they even helped clear the paths of snow during the last snowfall as he lists this off i see stanrick shift uncomfortably i frown and sigh i see how are stores holding up they are good for now though if the troubles increase we are going to need help to feed them all bowmen states i nod i am not surprised i am hoping the elders are already talking to the neighbors to secure extra food should be be necessary i will bring it up with clanleader cahal how long you staying bowmen asks i shrug  i dont know the weather was getting bad on our way here we may get snowed in for a while you know the trade you cook while you are here and everything is fine bowmen smiles i know stanrick caught a deer a few days ago so we smoked it to preserve it long enough to get it here  though it needs to be properly cured and dried i state bowmen smiles ill bring it in and set it up for curing bowmen reaches under the counter and pull out two brass keys handing one to each of us ill keep some of that deer and send the rest to the kitchen in the square i nod in agreement leading stanrick up the stairs to the door at the end of the hall i open the door for him and push it aside the room is fairly large with a small stone fireplace and mantel on the left with a cooking hook for a tea kettle or hanging oven as well as a small stash of wood near by a large four poster bed covered in blankets and furs sits against the back wall with a trunk at the foot a large round table sits to the right of the door across from the fire place  a cozy place for travelers walking to the back wall i set my bags down stanrick looks around  its smaller than then his cabin though not by much are the other two rooms we passed this big as well he asks no they are smaller they have cast iron stoves and double beds  its where my brother and i stayed when we where younger so whats next stanrick asks  i sigh saying next    i go make my presence known to the clanleader and we work from there  stanrick and i stand at the steps of clanleaders longhouse set atop heavy stone risers carved from the hillside itself perhaps the largest longhouse ive ever seen it is about two and half stories of solid oaken structure with intricatelycarved and inlaid pillars on either side of the door if you have a trained eye you can see the protective runes embedded within the knotwork the doors are imposing with reinforced hinges and an elaborately decorated archway carved to look like two large oak trees each holding a raven watching any who enter i paused just outside the doors forcing my face to go blank and trying to stamp out the roiling emotions i felt i need to be about business now adjusting the backpack on my shoulder i meet the guards eye and he nods at me only glancing at my escort for a moment before tapping his neck i nod back adjusting my torc to be perfectly straight and smile at him before signaling that he can open the door taking a deep breath i enter the halls the main hall is large twolevel room with individual boxes on the second level balcony for the clans elders to have meetings away from the general public who even nowc crowd the lower level benches stored off to the side offer seating and can easily be removed from hall tapestries depicting the symbols of the packs that make up spiritclaw hang from certain boxes denoting the pack that sits there today is like every other the hall busy with dignitaries from the various clans vying for the clanleaders attention stewards meeting with craftsmen and traders making sure their goods and skills are put to best use the hall is more crowded than usual however  refugees trying to stay warm no doubt i feel stanrick right on my heels as i weave through the crowd i think i saw dignitaries from clan grimward and nightriver i hear stanrick whisper to me i nod responding not surprised i am sure they are trying to convince my clan to pick a side approaching the simple riser that has three elaborately carved chairs  a large one in the center and two slightly smaller ones flanking it  sitting in front of doors on both sides that lead to the studies and living quarters of the clan leader and his family as well as for the high priestess between the doors hang a large dark green banner with the three gold arcing stars the symbol for clan spiritclaw to the left and right there are smaller banners  red with a golden flame in the middle for pack solfire and an one from clan steinjotunn vedrfolnir i believe these banners represent the clanleader the high priestess and the clan leaders primary mate i need to take a few moments to take in the entire scene the clanleader the high priestess and his mate all sit in their appointed places  not exactly a rare occurrence but a reminder of what my clan holds dear that and the reasons i have returned clanleader cahal spirtclaw perches on his chair studying a manifest that had been handed to him by one of his stewards cahal looks to be in his sixtieth winter and has been clanleader for about 20 years i still remember when he got elected  i was in my early teens and i remember the moot that it happened at it was one of the largest moots that anyone can remember his short cropped blond hair just barely dusted with gray though its hard to see serves to highlight his yellow eyes  an especially bright mark of the great wolf  and even at his age his fangs remain quite large born on the cusp of the truthseeker moon and the talesinger moon he seems to have the unique ability to both see the balance of the situation and express his thoughts eloquently seriously wounded in the mordok attack that bowmen speaks of he recovered after a time but needed the use of a cane since then moreso than any other clanleader in our history he relies on his truthseekers as traveling is difficult due to his infirmity though he has been known to show up unannounced in especially tricky situations dressed in dark green woolen pants and a white tunic overlaid with his dark green woolen doublet as well as a silvery wolf pelt over one shoulder demonstrating that he is both clanleader and chieftain  and warding off the chill i suspect to his left in high priestess morrigan solfire bearing the dark red hair and yellow eyes that all females in her pack acquire as marks and wearing a burgundy dress  wellsuited to her hair  over a black woolen chemise despite being the high priestess for about 30 years she is younger then clanleader cahal pack solfire has always had more daughters than sons  and while not quite as numerous as the daughters of goldenfield they certainly produce the most daughters in our clan morrigans eldest son faelan leads her pack as chieftain though morrigan is still a pack elder and is often consulted on matters  no matter how embarrassing it is for him to be chastised by his mother for rash actions faelan happens to be at court today leaning over his mothers chair and talking to her about whatever matter happens to be on his mind only a few years older than me he has had his marks for a long while  dark hair worn long and pulled back into a tight ponytail red eyes and  like his mother  the great wolfs fangs to cahal right is gjertaoriginally from one of steinjotunns packs even though her and cahal are mates she does occasionally travels between the clans so she can visit her relatives more than just the clanleaders mate though she oversees our clans hawks explaining her presence at the high seats of the clan near her their son henrick is studying hawk feathers  the same age as asgeir would have been they played often when i was in town he is actually the first one to notice me and comes racing down the steps to tug on my gambeson while smiling up at me i kneel down as he eagerly holds up two feathers this is from a redtail hawk and this one is from a gray one he says eagerly thats very good henrick are you going to follow in your mothers footsteps  i ask i dont know yet it depends if i have any skills with the actual animals but mom says i cant play with the hawks till im older he states with the enthuasism of a child he holds the gray feather out to me im glad youre home i was afraid you disappeared like asgeir did as he finishes speaking i take the offered feather it amazes me how children can say the simplest things and  yet  touch us to our core thank you henrick i smile and he turns to bound back up the stairs his mother witnessing the entire exchange smiles and leans over to her mate while nodding her head in my direction cahal looks up from his manifest and studies me for a moment before handing it back to the stewards and dismissing him he motions me over and i kneel down before him rise truthseeker you are home now he states thank you clanleader i have much to report i start as i stand again i bet you do he says cutting me off though he is no longer looking at me  he is looking past me to stanrick sensing the proper decorum he has taken up a defensive position behind me just to my left i see you have warranted a longfang escort back from onsallas of sorts clanleader runeseer solveig saw cause to send me home with an escort this is true this is stanrick longfang warrior of pack longfang and my mate i state cahals eyes snap back in my direction and he frowns at me i can feel a cold sweat starting at the small of my back as he continues to glare at me i dare not flinch or move feeling the tension in the room thicken stanrick shifts beside me  i now have the attention of high priestess morrigan and gjerta morrigan is studying me with the same gaze as cahal and gjerta looks at me sympathetically as henricks eyes shoot back and forth between me and his father uncertain what is going on cahal raises his cane and slams it down on the floor the echo reverberating around the room as everyone falls silent and all eyes turn on us i try to keep my breathing calm and controlled i knew that this was a possibility you are a truthseeker your duty is to me and my people  your people cahal states loudly so everyone in the hall can hear before this assembly and your mate recite your oath to me so all can remember what it is you do for gaia i breathe in deeply and take off my ravenheaded torc holding out the end for cahal to grasp i selena stargazer daughter of haldane stargazer who was the son of freya stargazer who was the daughter of huginn stargazer whose truth rang in the great wolfs ears do reaffirm my pledge to you cahal spritclaw as my clanleader i pledge to fly out when beckoned as the ravens did for the great wolf and bring back news and information i swear to do so honorably and without prejudice or bias so that you may make a decision with a balanced heart should i fail at my duties i shall be cast out never to see hearth nor home again and upon my death the great wolf shall eat me denying me my home in the hereafter cahal nods at me and loudly pronounces as a member of the ravens flock i reaffirm to you my support and hereby swear on the ring of the truthseeker that you will be my eyes and ears those who threaten you threaten me and as the great wolf promised protection to the ravens for their loyalty and service i hereby affirm that same oath to you so gaia hear my oath and the great wolf hold me to it he releases the torc and i return it to my neck while taking a step back both of you shall meet with us for dinner we shall talk then truthseeker cahal says yes cahal i answer and with that we were dismissed for the time being stanrick steers me towards the wall under the balconies what was that all about he hisses at me i shake my head if i had to wager a guess it was a show of dominance i have a feeling that nightriver and grimward had been pushing him hard it was a show to them and anyone else that he is in fact in charge and he will not be so easily swayed by pretty words i was used as a reminder that he is in charge as well as the fact that i am his eyes and ears so killing me  or any of his truthseekers  will have greater consequences than they realize stanrick harumphs at me make sense i suppose i still didnt like it i know beloved i kiss his forehead stanrick and i walked passed the guards stationed at the doors to the private section of the great hall our escort leading the way evening meal had come most of the hall had cleared out even the refugees has left to go down to the kitchen in the square our escort led us to the large dining room at the back of the lodge my cousin caught my gaze as we entered the room  she is apparently on duty tonight all awkwardness aside the dirty look she gave me when stanrick walked in beside me was quite entertaining there had been two seats saved for us across from gjerta and henrick even high priestess solfire and her son faelan were there tonight i could feel my steps falter a bit as walked taking my place next to my clanleader and across from gjerta stanrick sat to my left next to faelan and across from henrick who studyied him with an unabashed look of awe on his face he had never seen a longfang warrior before though i know he has heard the tales the last time clanleader cahal requested the skills of the longfangs was well before henrick was born but the stories were still told servers began bringing out the food legs of lamb and chicken root vegetables and unleavened breads along with wine and mead gaia bless children for being the ones who can just come out and ask the uncomfortable questions that must be on everyones minds selena    why did you go into the swamp did you not want to live anymore henrick asked i was in midchew on my bread and meat and it took some selfcontrol not to choke on it i could see the blush starting to rise on gjertas face and the disapproving look that cahal shot his son even though henrick was oblivious as he looked at me in wonder sighing i began no henrick i went because i was needed i was told they needed someone who could divine locations since i had fought with the corruption when i helped bring the idol back here last summer they thought i might be more resistant and could handle the swamp better i knew ulven were going into the swamp i was not going to let them go alone when i had the skills necessary to help bring them home henrick frowned at me but you almost died and what about your job to father yes i almost did die there were also a large number of outsiders that went as well and i knew it would be a good opportunity to see how they would react nothing brings out the truth more than facing death fear often strips away pride and prejudice as well as making us realize things that are truly important in that case not all outsiders were good but there were some that rose above even though it took us longer to get home most of us made it back henrick narrows his eyes at me as he contemplates what i said i still think it was dumb for you to go into the swamp he states plainly i hear stanrick stifle a giggle behind his glass of mead i sigh yeah you arent the only one so what were you divining high priestess morrigan asks me at first i thought i was looking for a book that was the item that the majority of the group was looking for when the cart and everything broke down i thought i was trying to find the best way out of the swamp apparently neither of those things is what i was connected to i nudge stanrick who pulls out a star of gaia from under his tunic apparently i was looking for that the group we call the pirates found it amongst other items in the swamp after hearing about how stanrick and i almost died  how annoyed i was that they just left without telling me they found it so i could stop looking  they offered it to me as an apology along with some their tasty drink that and i think they knew if they tried to barter it back to us we may have just killed them to return this to the ulven people  i shrug a little  when i touched it i knew that it was the item i was tracking in the end how such a powerful item got so far into the swamp i have no idea pausing i turn and look at clan leader cahal  the pirates are not the most honorable of the outsiders but they understand the rules of survival better than most the captain understands the idea that he needs to take care of his crew his crew may not like him  nor on occasion respect him  but they do follow him when push comes to shove their rituals are a little strange  i watched them brand his own son as a rite of passage and they have a slave girl who i think is torn between wanting her freedom and wanting the companionship that the crew provides they are unique even among the outsider groups i have seen are they a hindrance cahal asks currently more of a nuisance than a hindrance i state but they almost cost you your life henrick blurts out i blink at the child yes but they also apologized it would be rude not to accept their apology they are trying and i think they are learning their old life of raiding doesnt get you much here we dont trade the shiny things like outsiders do so those things are not on the few boats we set to the seas so raiding our ships is not as valuable as it was at their home  or at least not as valuable as they would like besides the moment they become a hindrance people  either ulven or outsider  will just kill them  i state henrick seemed to calm down with the notion that if they become too much of a problem they will just be removed cahal looks at stanrick you have been quiet the outpost has a constants stream of outsiders and visitors more than any other territory outside of nightriver what has been your take on the outsiders stanrick leans back in his chair pulling out his pipe from his waist pouch he contemplates the question as he packs his pipe finally responding in his quiet voice i have mixed feelings they have stepped up time and time again to defend the outpost when whiteoak tried to raid and take over both the outpost and the village humans came to defend the village there are downsides as well  there has been an increase in bandit activity on the roads leading to the outpost while most tend to behave in the outpost we have some whose silly games have almost burnt it down then again my younger brother has almost burnt down the outpost on occasion stanrick pauses to take a long drag on his pipe honestly cahal they are like our young they dont know the rules or customs and need lessons some are older and never had a hand to guide them so it makes sense that they resent us for trying to show them how to act however i do know one human a honorable man who goes by the name william  you would think him an ulven who just lost his fangs i think he is the reason that even though i lost my first mate and father to them in the war i can look past that and see good reason in keeping them around cahal leans back in his chair in contemplation i frown i saw grimward and nightriver emissaries when i came in cahal looks up at me and sighs yes they have been here for about a month now each trying to outdo the other with getting my attention its why i called you out like i did both their words are compelling but i trust the stories and words you truthseekers bring back they hold more weight as they are not clouded by personal judgment or the judgment of their elders they would do well to remember where my priorities lie  the truth we seek rather than the truth they think exists you weigh the needs of the people with what you see and hear i nod in agreement to that if anyone want to get my attention they best do it through the truthseeker i have sent to discern the truth in this struggle and prove that their side is the one gaia has chosen what is our neighbors take on all this i ask stienjotunn is remaining neutral  or as close as they can while still following the path set out by gaia many rely on our hawks  gerta states cahal nodds goldenfield seems to be leaning towards nightriver as they have always had good relations squallborn are being awfully quiet though their ancient ties to grimward worry some they do not seem inclined to jump one way or another from what i can tell no one has contacted axhound yet though they have had no love for whiteoak for as long as anyone can remember i frown if we havent started talking to some of the neutral clans we should i hear that our stores are holding for now but if the increase in refugees happens we may be struggling high priestess morrigan looks at me its being handled the early snow and cold has made getting messages and sending emissaries out harder than normal i decide now is a good time to change the subject high priestess morrigan has anything become of the idol that i had cleansed she frowns at me  progress has been slow going as you know many tasks have gotten sidetracked due to the war and refugees we are still trying to figure out a way to approach it safely but for now its corruption is contained enough that unless a large band of mordok try to steal it it is of a lower priority i sigh a little at the news disappointed at the slow progress though speaking of new things     she smiles at me my wine glass halts halfway to my lips you have a new mate both stanrick and i shift in our chairs feeling uneasy yes i do is that a problem i ask slowly a hint of confrontation from the earlier display creeping into my voice as my eyes shift back and forth from everyone at the table trying to gauge them i had a feeling that this topic was discussed before stanrick and i arrived cahal began speaking first his voice completely different from our encounter in the hall oh no of course not child your mother would have been elated at your new choice but your father on the other hand     he paused picking his words carefully     would have been weary but happy for you cahal smiles at me  he knew my father and my mother before he became clanleader they had all fought to defend the settlement from the mordok onslaught forty years ago and it was dads pinead sap bandages that helped to save cahals leg you two need a test that you can do together to prove that you are good mates morrigan stated matter of factly what about the job i am already on wont it interfere i ask worried at this new turn of events no the high priestess and i had discussed it cahal says taking over for morrigan we have figured something suitable for both of you and it ties in to the job that you are already doing for me i could feel the sense of dread coming on stanrick looks to me and then at cahal and morrigan we both know this is traditional clanleaders and elder often test new couples to make sure that they are going to work well together but it has been a while since runeseer solveig saw fit to send stanrick on any sort of test with his previous mates we would like you to study the outsiders culture more cahal stated i blinked a few times trying to process this you have more experience than my other truthseekers with outsiders i expect that since your new mate has his own duties to attend to as well that you will be spending more time near the outpost i will shuffle the other truthseekers accordingly to make sure their wings cover all the fields i need to keep my eyes on morrigan and i would like to hear more about the outsiders rituals their lore their gods and their customs cahal says his voice remaining steady seeking any hint of fear from either one of us how does this help you with the war clanleader i ask carefully one of the rumors you brought back to me early on was that many of grimwards forces believe that outsiders brought the undead with them even though we know this lich he said sounding out the unfamiliar word came out of the swamp and to our knowledge no one lives there the underlying thought there is that the outsiders corrupt the land while the watchwolf declaration fixed some of it there has still been a great increase in corruptive idols like the one you brought back as well as mordok attacks if the mordok are using the outsider to feed their corruption it leads credence to grimwards rallying cry to cast them off our lands and if they are aligned with dangerous gods that falls into my territory high priestess morrigan adds i sigh heavily the elders logic make sense and they might be right if the outsiders are going to be used to keep this war going we need to know more about them is your duty understood cahal asks looking at both of us stanrick and i look at each other sighing yes clanleader we respond in unison cahal nodds good i will compose a letter for runeseer solveig and send it with a hawk so she is made aware of your quest as well the rest of the dinner went fine with the mood lightening considerably as we spoke of less weighty matters cahal talked stanrick into helping train the guard while he was here i think stanrick enjoyed the notion that he is going to get to scare the balls off the guard they have not experience longfang training and cahal thinks they were getting complacent especially given our location on mardrun and the relatively safety from the mordok time to shake them up i was to continue my own training with high priestess morrigan as it has become obvious that my magical skills are indeed growing it also became apparent as a bitter wind swept through the hall that we may in fact be stuck here for a while so we may as well be productive about it  it is still fairly early in the night as i lead stanrick through the streets his hand rests nervously on his sword as we pass both the square and bowmens common house where are we going he asks me my chieftains house  i state weary from the day  are you sure you want to go tonight you sound exhausted he frowns at me  i just need to keep it together a little while longer  i state he squeezes my hand as we walk i just need to get all the formalities and introduction out of the way before i lose my nerve clan leader cahal took my return and the news of my new mate about as well as i expected but i had missed the pack moot this year as well as i was in grimward territory talking to khulgar i have a lot to atone for and catch up on between missing that and heading into the dirge we stop in front of a modest house i knock at the door and birgit keress younger sister answers the door she squints at me in the low light before squealing and yanking me inside moooooooom selena is here and she brought a boy with her brigit yells at the top of her lungs shes only seen fourteen winters and looks like she just got her marks since the last time i saw her her eye have turned a emerald green much like her dads which is quite striking against her brown hair i also notice that her fangs have grown in while she is yelling across the house i groan running my hand over my face yeah so much for formal tradition erin come in from the kitchen and garik come down from upstairs erin even though she is dressed only in a dark blue dress over a black woolen chemise you can tell she is carrying the weight of her station the hem of her dress is embroidered with silver stars and she wears the pelt of her station around her hips we stand there for a moment looking at each other before she finally walks up to me and hugs me i finally allow myself to crumble the walls and decorum i put up vanishing as i feel tears start streaming down my cheeks i am sorry i said i was going to be there for you and i wasnt i state as i try and pull myself back together shhh she says raising a hand to stroke my hair you were doing your duty no one can fault you for that the pack knows that your job as truthseeker is more important nobody is mad at you erin move to hold me out at arms length you are here now that is all that matters i nod relieved at that she smiles come sit down and tell me about your escort here erin and garik are only a few years older than stanrick by my guess and the two males have been studying each other while erin and i spoke i nod to her erin stargazer chieftain of pack stargazer this is stanrick longfang warrior for pack longfang and my mate erin blinks at me a moment then grins as she holds out her arm to stanrick stanrick clasps her wrist and nods erin smiles as she introduces everyone to stanrick this is my mate garik silverleaf originally from clan shattered spear though he left his clan and joined ours once we mated you have already meet birgit  she is my youngest garik takes the opportunity to disappear into the kitchen and returns a tray with tea kettle and cups i heard you had dinner with the clanleader probably had your fill of drink for tonight garik states i smile at that thinking of how different this reception is to the longfangs tradition of getting roaring drunk at a meeting we sat at the table drinking and discussing and erin had just finished telling me how the moot went that i startled when the door slammed open keres came storming in shield in hand and was at the table before any of us could utter a sound i keres stargazer daughter of erin stargazer member of pack stargazer and clan spirtclaw challenge you stanrick longfang warrior of pack longfang to an honor duel for the honor of my cousin selena keres yells not even bothering to greet either of us the loud thunk was i was fairly certain all of our jaws hitting the table i was about to retort when stanrick held his hand up in front of me stopping me midthought she made it formal its going to be formal then stanrick states plainly before i could even open my mouth to argue he turns looking keres straight in the eye without flinching i stanrick longfang warrior of pack longfang accept your challenge we shall fight sword and shield nonlethally no magic he says his voice steady keres nods agreed we all head out into the street stanrick and keres stand a good twelve feet apart facing each other weapons at the ready keres begins rushing in with a battle cry at her lips and the sound of steel hitting steel gets the attention of the neighbors and the guard erin informs the guard that this is an honor duel agreed upon by both parties and completely legal the guard then stops to watch keres a fellow guardsmen i merely sigh and sit on the steps scowling i hate being fought over i always have i have no idea what has gotten into my cousin to try and challenge a man at least twenty years her senior and a longfang for my honor no less i am perfectly able to defend my own honor though i have to admit this must be impressive to the casual onlooker  a longfang and a member of the guard going at it i can tell keres is trying to get under his defense as she swing furiously her blade clanging off of stanricks shield i can also tell that stanrick isnt trying very hard right now  fighting defensively feeling her out you can almost tell the moment when stanrick has had enough  his stance changes slightly and he rushes in beating keres shield out of the way taking her offbalance stanrick crouches and sweeps her legs out from under her sending her crashing to the stones beneath her feet stanrick steps on her sword arm as he places the point his sword under her chin yield he states calmly keres glares but sighs yes i yield i walk over as stanrick helps her up now explain what in the great wolfs ball sack that was all about keres looks at me then at the ground before sheepishly starting i   er    you were in the black i wasnt sure you could make sound judgment   i thought he took advantage of that     she stammered out eyes cast to the ground that she had so recently occupied the heat that shot from my eyes could probably have melted the snow around us if i glared long enough keres shrank in on herself a little i am sorry cousin i took a deep breath before hugging her i am sorry i scared you i am home for now she grabs onto my cloak and sobs into my shoulder i hold her for a moment before moving her to arms length smiling as i wipe away her tears oh and if you ever do that again i will make sure i ram my staff so far up your ass you will be coughing up splinters for a year she smiles at me blushing furiously from embarrassment and nods  we bid a good evening to my packmates and i am once again leading stanrick though the city i am tired  body and soul mind and heart i am just so damn worn we head up the hill past the clanleaders halls we stand before another hall that is just as big as the clanleaders long house and decorated in much the same way the outside is decorated with protective runes worked into intricate images of willow branches this is the healers hall i say as we get closer to the doors i hear a familiar thumping noise and quickly grab stanrick pulling him to one side before he can protest he curses as the doors slam open and three boys come running out stark naked their skin steaming in the cold air they jump into the nearest snow bank taunting the others that they will stay out the longest stanrick simply blinks at them in bewilderment too stunned to even articulate a curse i sigh and shake my head tugging his arm it will all make sense in a moment beloved we cross the threshold of the door and i shut it while stanrick stands in awe the longhouse is considerably warmer than it is outside right now pools are carved into the rock face of the hill and from the top a steaming geyser spits out water that trickles down and fills the pools runoff from the pools flows out the sides of the building supplying the stream that runs through town for washing clothes and the like behind the geyser is an intricate mosaic image depicting gaia and the great wolf as well as numerous alcoves that the healers use for private treatment a couple of the pools are roped off the water diverted to the others so those might be cleaned and repaired in one of the lower pools i see what had gotten the boys attention  three young females were staring at us    well staring at stanrick they giggled at each other as i shot them a withering glare stanrick of course didnt notice  or pretended to at least  as they were young enough to be our children they probably just got their marks earlier this year i nod my head in their direction young males try to get attention here through tests of endurance they warm up in the pools with the girls then they all rush out and roll around in the snow  whoever can last the longest wins though its really only a thing during the colder months i state as i lead stanrick over to the dressing alcoves there are boxes and the like that people place their clothes in i start to get undressed with stanrick following suit during summer its a test to see who can stay in the warmest pools the longest ive seen healers have to fish them out after they pass out from heat and stubbornness its fairly late now so the halls are quiet and most of the healers have gone home the pools are open no matter how low the sun dips tying up my hair i take stanricks hand leading him to one of the higher warmer pools i slide in the water coming up to my chest stanrick hesitates a moment seemingly studying something in the pool oh yeah the floors are mosaics as well each pool has its own image if you look you can find gaia luna sol or the great wolf looking down i notice that we happen to be in the one decorated with a picture of luna sitting surrounded by moon flowers absentmindedly i remark remind me to set us up an appointment with the healers stanrick frowns at me but were not injured surely their resources    i smile cutting him off no were not because thrand is quite skilled but the healers here are known for their massage techniques i have seen it do wonders for everything from old wound pains to a stubborn headache that wont go away stanrick contemplates this as he slides in unsure of the textured bottom i glide forward and sit on the ledge stanrick sits next to me and wraps his arms around my body i latch on to his arms and hold him close are you okay love stanrick asks after a few moments of silence i will be i just need you to hold me for a while i sigh stanrick kisses the top of my head okay day 1 i had been expecting a letter or some form of orders from my clan to figure out what to do next it never came so what other choice did i have but to go home it was going to be a ten day walk to spiritclaw territory i wasnt really looking forward to it it had been unseasonable cool all summer and winter came earlier than normal winter solstice is about four weeks away already you ready i hear stanrick call from outside in the yard i sigh and take one last look around the cabin this is his mothers cabin though technically it is his now that she has passed i had been staying with him for most of my time here at onsallas yet this place didnt feel like a home to me or at least not my home though i suppose it could with enough time i shake my head a little and chided myself i am a truthseeker i am not allowed a home as long as i am still active i will never be in one place long enough to make a home i tug the dust cloth over the dining table and bed and makes sure the fire in the hearth is good and out before gathering two book from the table next to the door and stepping out i see stanrick tugging the ropes keeping the camping gear in the wooden cart that i travel with that poor little cart is packed pretty tight as it normally designed to keep just my stuff now its got about two weeks worth of supplies plus armor and weapons i walk over to the cart and tuck the books into my packs stanrick wraps his arms around my waist and leans his chin on my shoulder youre quiet today he states i shrug a little sorry a lot on my mind beloved  i am nervous about this trip home a lot has happened between the swamp and stanrick and i becoming mates i am not sure how my clan my pack is going to take any of it not to mention i am going homewith stanrick he is going to see how i live and that also makes me nervous what if there are too many people for him to tolerate among the thousands of other what ifs i can think off he kisses my cheek and smiles its okay he is about to pick up the rope to the cart and string it around himself and i stop him he frowns at me i take it from him and loop it around my chest if we get attacked by mordok you need to be able to move more freely  i state he just sighs at me i dig my toes into the ground and use my legs to get the cart moving once its moves its not bad my uncle does good work and as long as we dont take it off trail it will make the journey just fine its even convertible for snow as i look up at the sky and sigh again i am almost positive that it will snow before we make it to everspring  day 3 my eyes snap open at the sound of stanrick yelling my name it takes me a moment to orientate myself i can feel stanrick trashing beside me i quickly put up my arm to block being smash in the face stanrick wake up  i shake him to try to get him up but he continues to be lost in what ever nightmare has him i feel his hand brush my cheek as i dodge another swing i sigh as i know as i am going to have to do it the hard way i am no stranger to nightmares but eventually i wake up from them and i dont thrash nearly as much stanrick seems to get lost in them like they are real for him and he is very hard to wake once he is entrenched in one i occasionally wonder if something is attacking him or maybe trying to tell him something through nightmares and that is an unpleasant thought to have i straddle his midsection and grab his arms and pin them down and use my legs to hold them there i can feel his muscles strain under my weight trying to throw me off stanrick i yell as i punch his chest he bucks wildly underneath me still entrenched in whatever is nightmare he is in i lay my weight on him and in his ear whisper beloved wake up i need you to wake up now i hear him inhale sharply and his muscles go still i pull back and he is blinking up at me looking a little confused as to why we were in the tent and not in what ever place he was dreaming about i slowly unwrap my legs from his arms and he wraps them around my midsection and pulls me close i can feel him take in a shaky breath we lay there awhile before he whispers to me we were trapped in the swamp again mordok had dragged you off i was fighting to get to you ylsa rhodi thrand orrin and bryech and some of the bastards where there i could hear you screaming my name it sounds like they were torturing you on top of it no matter how many i fought i couldnt get closer to you bryech and orrin were the first to fall thrand fell trying to get to ylsa and rhodi the bastards got separated from us ylsa rhodi and i got trapped in this thick black tar that was like quicksand and we were sinking i could still hear you screaming the more i struggled in the tar the quicker i sank ylsa and rhodi disappeared beneath the tar i had just sank beneath the surface and couldnt breath it felt like a hand clawing at me pulling me down farther but i heard your voice calling me telling me to wake up i frown and kiss his forehead youre awake and safe now i am here why dont you get up and ill switch out the warming stone and we can lay back down  he contemplates it for a moment before getting up i wrap myself in a rabbit fur blanket and a knitted blanket and slip on my boots and take the cold stones and switch them for the warm ones by the fire placing them in the knitted blanket i cant help but remember that i have dreamt of that black tar before i frown as i stoke the fire and place another log on it to keep it going the rest of the night and go back inside whats wrong stanrick asks as i place the stones its probably just coincidence that you and i are both dreaming of this black tar stuff  i state as i lay the furs back down over the warm rocks stanrick crawls back into bed and i crawl in after him and cuddle up close probably he states as he wraps his arms around me ill keep track of it we dont even know if the tar stuff is real i state rationalizing it mostly for myself stanrick kisses my forehead i know you will now get some sleep  day 5 we didnt get as far as we wanted today a little after mid day the cold came crashing down on us along with the snow i am grumpy mostly because i was right in the fact that it was going to snow before we made it to everspring i finish converting the cart to a sled as there was already a good two inches on the ground and it doesnt look like it going to be stopping anytime soon i repacked the sled and put the tarp on over the top i also got the tent up and staked to the ground before too much snow cover happened which was good cause the wind is whipping even if we are in the shelter of some trees stanrick had already gather a bunch of firewood and had started a fire and then went out for more as we both could feel the temperature continue to drop as the day went on i was crouched over the fire melting snow to fill our bota bags with water when i hear crunching in the snow the good thing about the snow is it makes it harder for things to sneak up on you i see stanrick come out of the trees with a stack of firewood on his back and a pair of hares in his hand he smiles at me they came racing out from under a bush right next to me almost didnt catch them he set the wood on the pile and hands me the hares i take them and walk some distance away do a prayer for the prey then proceed to skin and gut them i save the pelts to treat later so i can add them to the rabbit fur blanket i walk over to the supplies and pull out some of my cooking wear and spices and proceed to cook a pair of hares and i have to say they were pretty good i would of liked some potatoes or leeks or some such to make with them but you work with what you got we sit by the fire in silence just listening to the fire crack and the snow fall i smile a little and snuggle in close stanrick wraps his arms around me i can feel him work his hand under my tunic to keep his hand warm it surprises me sometimes how natural and organic our relationship is we dont need to talk or entertain each other we can just be in each others presence and that is enough i can feel his fingers trace a line on my stomach just below my belly button to the right side about half a palm length its the oldest scar i have you going to tell me about this one he asks as he continues to play with the scar i squirm a little the memory still hurts stanrick frowns at me as i stare down at my lap it takes me quite awhile to work up the words to tell him mom and dad had just negotiated room and board for us in one of the northern settlements of clan shattered spear in between the swamp and the ocean we were still a good two days from onsallas though we had just left the watchwolves about day and half prior we were actually heading to onsallas to help with the pineed sap harvest so we could get more so dad could make more bandages for trade dad and my first mate torolf managed to snag a deer and a couple of pheasants which we split with the village as thanks for there hospitality asgier was asking me all sorts of questions as i was preparing the meal trying to be helpful it was a fairly normal night all things considered we had gone to sleep in the nearby storage house i was awakened late in the night by the sounds of steel hitting steel torolf had already taken asgier to a hiding place i was alone in the house i peer out the window to see my mother and my brother fighting creatures that i can barely describe they were pale and had no eyes their mouths opened larger than should have been normal some looked like fallen warriors though their skin was rotting and their eyes were milky white those that could wield magic even though i was never hit with it just being in its presence made my skin crawl there was one who could wield magic and fought with a weapon that appeared to be made out of bone i watched from the window as my brother was run through by it and dropped i picked up my staff and charged out begging gaia to protect me and give me the strength to defend my family most of the creatures didnt want to come near me for some reason though i have no idea what i did those that did and i managed to hit screamed in pain i remember taking a mace to the hip and in the back before i put my staff through it face i finally got to my brother and dropped down to start to heal him i wasnt paying attention and had no idea what was going on so i didnt notice when he started to move again he sat bolt upright grabbed my shoulder and ran his dagger through my stomach i locked eyes with him i knew he couldnt see me his eyes were milky white i panicked and placed my hands on his chest to push him way but when i did he twitched hard like i had stabbed him and he fell back down and didnt move again i know i had used magic on him but i didnt know what i did i lean back against stanrick and wrap my arms on top of his i could feel the tears sting my eyes threatening to fall as i remember my brother laying there i remember staggering to the side of the building holding my stomach i knew it wasnt good i was four months pregnant at the time so i was trying to stop the bleeding and cast healing magic on myself before the trauma triggered a miscarriage either something waylaid me or a piece of the building fell on me i dont know which but i remember seeing the ground coming up fast and then blackness when i awoke keres was there trying to heal me but it was too late my body had already started to go into labor it was a girl but she was still born keres tried to revive her but to no avail she was just too small and it was too late  i could hear the crack in my voice and feel the tears on my cheek as i continued i named her moira keres wrapped her in cloth and told me that there was a pyre in the middle of town for everyone she had told me how the others died my mother was found not far from where my brother had fallen sword and shield still in hand trying to protect a young family who also didnt make it dad was found pinned to a tree by magic barely a mark on him but face twisted like he had died in agony his quiver only a third empty torolf was found on the trail sword in hand shot through the back with a half dozen arrows when keres moved the body is when they found asgier under him torolf tried to use his own body to protect our son one of the arrows had gone straight through torolf and into asgier keres did the rite for moira and added her to the pyre i remember crumpling to the ground screaming and just rocking with keres holding me till i couldnt scream anymore keres wiped her own tears away and asked me to take the survivors they found to a more safe location i was in no condition to fight how people survived carnage is beyond me she told me to head north then east that the roads they came from are cleared and that the threat was heading south i handed her the last of the pineed sap bandages that dad had made and told her not to die too and we parted ways we didnt run into each other again till she came to fetch me from the drunken uncle saying i had been summoned by the clan leader i swallow hard and pull myself back together but that happened a little over a year ago right stanrick asked carefully i nodded yeah the scar looks older because i didnt take good care of myself and didnt keep the wound and bandages clean enough so it had gotten infected a week or so later the healers werent happy with me  i sigh and look up out of habit and frown the sky is still cloudy and snow continues to fall stanrick pulls me close and holds me dont worry i am sure they are there i nod i know they would make sure i saw them going home we sit in silence for a little while longer when stanrick turn to me and goes did you know they bite i blink for a second what the undead they bite mordok bite and it hurts a lot the undead bite you it is like ten mordok biting you at the same time it the most painful thing i have ever felt and i got bit twice once in the leg and once in the arm stanrick untangles himself from me to go stoke the fire and add more wood i dig in one of the bags next to me and pull out materials to make hot chocolate stanrick continues his story as i warm up some water fredrick was there to help or at least to keep me company as the healers use teas and leeches to tend the wounds they had to use magic too like it refused to be treated until both were used i think the cure is almost as bad as the bite either way the scars disappeared when the lich was killed nobody has been able to explain that  huh interesting i state and sip my drink the bastards seem to always be there when shit goes really wrong yeah theyre funny like that stanrick smiles i sit and contemplate that for while as i finish my drink stanrick suddenly scoops me up and smiles at me enough of heavy talk i am cold and i can think of a much better way for you to keep me warm oh really now i smirk as he carries me to the tent  day 7 it was getting late the sky was still cloudy i knew of a settlement not far from here i stayed there often when traveling this stretch of road this is a popular trade road that runs through clan goldenfield territory and connected it with clan riverhead and clan spiritclaw i knew we were about half way through goldenfield territory at this point i must of let my gaurd down cuase i didnt notice the mordok till they came crashing out of the snow covered trees stanrick was on them before i could even swing my staff around to help he quickly dispatched them as i come racing up behind him to make sure he isnt wounded where are the other two he pants at me what are you talking about there are only three i state no there were two more he glances at me for a moment before he eyes dart around trying to find more mordok no beloved see only three tracks and three depressions in the snow i push back the brush with my staff to expose the three depressions in the snow where they were hunkered down waiting for us to get closer stanrick stalks over and i can see him kneeling down to examine the depressions and the track marks fine he huffs and stands back up i think he is a little upset that there werent more to kill the mordok here are fierce but not like the ones near the swamp they are not has heavily armored and arent in as large of bands i think stanrick was expecting more of a challenge stanrick goes to collect firewood to burn the corpses so they dont contaminate gaia he insisted we burn them i understand his logic its not wrong i fully agree that the mordok are poison and damage gaia especially after the recent dreams i been having though sometimes i think he forgets that i am a daughter of gaia and can cleans things and can do other magic than just heal when he comes back i had drawn a large circle in the snow around where we are going to burn the mordok i was huddled over the my pack digging out my reagents what are you doing he asks as he drops the wood and starts arranging it and the bodies gaia is in more than just the earth beneath our feet she is in the air we breath the water in the streams fire in our souls the fire keeps them from contaminating the ground but what about the rest of it  i finally find what i am look for a wooden box that has runes and symbols on it i pull it out and pop it open and pull out a herb bundle its a ritual to cleanse a space it will keep the corruption from entering the other elements as well  stanrick frowns at me i dont think he understand i just sigh go get more wood stanrick that wont be enough to even partially burn them in this cold it is just after dark when we light the fire stanrick watches me as i light the herb bundle then blow it out so it smolders and start to walk around the fire clockwise arms held up to the sky mother gaia give blessings unto me this rite in this space yours shall be air of high refine purify this place  fire purge this divine space  water protect this circle so its peace shall not be broken by the strength of my soul this prayer unto gaia is spoken i walk the circle five times chanting the prayer its not the strongest of rites i know but will suffice for cleansing mordok taint outside of the swamp i know at least two more cleansing rites that are stronger when i am done i step back from the circle and snuff out the herb bundle in the snow and store it away stanrick is just watching me i can tell he is contemplating something cause he keeps clenching his jaw i lean down to pick up the rope for the sled and he stops me let me this time  he picks up the rope and we start moving there is a settlement about an hour or two up the road here we can barter for lodging at the small inn there for the night i state he nods he barely says two words to me for the rest of the trek whatever he is thinking about it must really be bothering him  day 9 just down this path i call back where are you going selena i hear stanrick call you will see i call i am a little giddy we are about a day out from everspring i pause on the path and wait for stanrick to catch up with the sled i am taking him to my home grounds each pack has a place where their pack started more precisely for clan spiritclaw a place where the pack chose their name some packs have forgotten where or how their names came about some sites have been lost to mordok pack sites are holy ground the flow of gaias energy to her children are stronger at these sites this is why being cast out of your pack is such a high punishment it means you will never be allowed to see your home grounds again and feel that really close connection to gaia on top of never seeing your family again this is especially devastating if you are a daughter of gaia we are always connected to gaia but we dont really feel at peace until we are on our home lands stanrick catches up the sled is lighter now that we been on the road so long but its being unruly on this side path stanrick and i break through the tree line the field opens for miles in all direction the clearing could probably fit the entire clan if it wanted to so it easily fits the several hundred members of my pack and their tents for when we do pack moots here in the center of the clearing jets a rocky structure many feet high from the top one can get a mostly unhindered view of the sky from the horizon to horizon in a complete circle stanrick stops and looks around the clearing i watch him shift warily side to side and im not sure if that is an unconscious reaction to the energy under his feet or if he is cold what is this place he asks as i lead him closer to the rock in the middle so we can set up camp this is the place where pack stargazer got their name  i smile help me set up camp and ill tell you the story while i cook dinner i set up the tent while stanrick went and got wood for the fire i dont know how he does it but he managed to also bring back a small deer as well we build a slightly bigger fire than normal so we can smoke the meat we dont eat and use it for trade once we get to everspring i also take a couple of nice cuts and set them aside for the ritual later i cut up meat for the stew and set it all in the dutch oven with a couple of potatoes onions and carrots that i had traded for a few days earlier when we were at the inn i place the dutch oven on the fire to cook and move some coals on top stanrick is look at me as i cuddle up in his arms so he asks i smile the sagas say that during the time when gaia and the great wolf still walked with us packs were still forming and names were still being chosen the mordok threat was great and the children of gaia and the great wolf rallied in small bands to protect the land hunting parties left and came back successful during one such raid the unthinkable happened the children were left in the den and the young mother we know as jorunn was left to watch them while her mate and family went on the hunting party with the great wolf and the great mother upon their return the den was in ruins jorunn lay broken and battered and barely alive next to the seven cubs who bodies were mutilated and barely recognizable between gasps of pain jorunn told the story of how after the party had left the mordok had ambushed the den from the other direction and that she was out numbered but fought to save the children distraught gaia went to jorunn and laid her hand on her and healed her but when gaia tried to revive the children their bodies were too broken jorunns howls of loss and pain drew the attention of luna who came down and saw the carnage and cried tears of blood for the children tinting her normally pale face red luna being able to see both this realm and the next looked at joruun and to her sister and told them that the children are still here and that she can see them even though their bodies are broken and no longer moving she said she will take them with her to live with her in her domain the great wolf seeing the pain on his mates face and that of his children stated that since the cubs were not given the chance to earn a name for themselves in life they can do so from the other side and asked his mates sister to place them in her realm so that we may still see them from this realm luna agreed luna gathered the broken bodies of the children imbuing them with a fraction of her light and placed them in the sky as little points of light luna kept the cub close together in the sky so they are never far from each other so they are not lonely every night jorunn would go out and watch the little points of light often from the top of this structure which would wave at her from their place in the sky i look up from where i am and easily find the 7 points i am looking for and point those seven points there are what i think are the seven nameless cubs they constantly run around the star we refer to as the den parent all the stars seem to go around this one star who the den parent was is mostly unknown some stories say it was the third child of the gaia and the great wolf that was still born some say that it was a cub who was killed by his siblings some think that it is a child of luna and an unknown father  i shrug stanrick smiles at me thats a nice story so this is where the den was i nod so we believe there is a large cave that has glyphs in it under the outcropping of rock we think that is where the den was our scholars debate if the glyphs are older than the rune language or not or if they worked in tandem we do know they are not mordok writing as my pack has taken care of this land since time began and there has never been any sign that this land was once corrupted  i carefully take the lid off the oven and check on dinner its ready after dinner i have stanrick help me by grabbing some extra firewood taking it to the cave with me once inside we find the burned out fire pit clean it and rekindle the fire once lit it reveals the cave in it simplicity this cave could fit about thirty people ledges to the left and right side the back wall is mostly smooth the rock is one of the harder rocks found on mardrun so how this cave came to be out of it is unknown i have used this cave in a pinch as a temporary shelter when ive been traveling when its too late to pitch the tent or when the weather is too rough normally the pack priestess or witch stays in the cave for the duration of the pack moot it is also used as a ritual site when the weather is inclement or for those of us that travel in winter normally the big rites are done at the top of the structure so the entire pack can see i state as i set up my ritual gear i watch stanrick take a torch and walk over to the writing wall and look at the glyph the glyphs take up a smooth section of the back wall stanrick turns and watches as i perform the homecoming ritual or at least a single practitioner version of it this is a smaller version of the rite we do at the pack moot the large version honors gaia the great wolf the first pack and our founder it strengthens our bond with gaia and casts a protective barrier around our lands so should mordok try and take it the land is not easily corrupted and we have a chance to fight to take it back it also said that the rite will also let the pack priestess or witch know that the land is in danger the barrier lasts a year this is why we do the pack moot every fall this ritual normally involves a live sacrifice normally of a couple of deer or pigs which we then roast and eat at the big revel afterwards the single practitioner version of it is similar but instead of casting the barrier it helps reinforce the barrier every time its casts and doesnt require a live sacrifice i missed the ritual this year i was in grimward territory working during our pack moot to those that came before me i offer these to you and ask for your forgiveness since i was not here to honor you properly  i place the nice cuts of meat that i saved from the deer on the fire as an offering from my box i pull a candle and light it and place it before me i also pull four stone arrow heads that i have hand carved from obsidian stone i place an arrow head to the north i place this arrow to the north so that all bad forces may be ground to nothing by the earth i place one to the east and say i place this arrow to the east so that all negativity may be blown away by the wind i place one to the south and say i place this arrow to the south so that all ill feelings may be burnt up by flames i place the last one to the west i place this arrow to the west so that all harmful intent may be washed away by water i place my hand over the candle flame close enough that i can feel the heat by the power of my soul i add to the shield of this place so nothing negative may enter let this shield remain all days and all the nights till the season comes around again i sit there a moment as i can feel the energy flow from me out into the earth i quietly pack my stuff up and stand i sway a little and i feel stanrick grab my arm you okay he asks i nod yeah heavier rituals take a little bit more ill be fine still not as bad as when the idol was cleansed i lean my head on his shoulder a moment do you know what any of these glyphs mean stanrick asks as he holds a light closer to the wall so i can see the glyphs we think the one that looks like a hill is the symbol for gaia the one that has the hill with an upside down hill above it with the little tick marks on the hill is the symbol for the pack or for the ulven as a whole there is still debate about that i been told the more complicated symbol that looks like its crying is the symbol for love that is all that is really been figured out so far with the outbreak of the war and with the current activity in the mordok and the corruption weve been so focused on learning about what is going on a lot of our other clan research and learning projects got pushed to the wayside i sigh lets head back to camp i am tired and could use a hot drink stanrick nods and takes my hand and leads me out of the cave  day 10 in the morning we pack and finish the final leg of our journey to everspring now my work is about to beginbefore him i am bound by honor  rill walked through the village with a purpose if her nononsense stride wasnt enough to convince others to move out of her way her fiery and angry scowl would do the trick she had just returned from the coast with a dozen longfang hunters they had escorted her to see the small group of longfang warriors off on a stormjarl longship the ship along with the emissary was to make its way to the southern edge of nightriver territory and link up with other ships that would take the longfang warriors to clan stormjarl territory she continued to walk lost in her own thoughts as she approached the long house of onsallas village she was still at a loss of words that the phoenix syndar had brought to them a claimant bar from the stormjarls how did they even get the stupid thing she knew she was a bit harsh in seizing the syndar female and forcing her to turn the claimant over even temporarily but she was willing to ruffle a few feathers in order to look into the reasoning behind the bar the claimant being found and brought to the village was the worst timing ever she didnt even fully understand why it was so damned important its arrival had confirmed clan stormjarl calling upon an honor debt that pack longfang owed them from decades ago pushing past the burly guards to enter the long house rill shoved the giant wooden doors aside and stormed into the room behind her the guards quickly shut the door inside the room a few daughters of gaia were tending to their duties and waiting quietly and patiently the runeseer was deep in her seeing mediation unblinking eyes shining like glowing moons turned to rill as the runeseer cast another hand of runes onto the mat in front of her soulveig this is wrong what are we doing why are we sending our warriors to clan stormjarl demanded rill as she came to a stop in front of the runeseer it was obvious that the time for any honorifics or professional greetings was over silence rill you know better than to address me this way reminded soulveig in an even and emotionless tone no not this time gaia be damned i wont stand by and let this happen roared rill as she bristled and looked as vicious as ever she looked like an angry wolf ready to pounce and kill an odd silence hung throughout the room as rills angry gaze stayed locked with soulveigs emotionless stare the other daughters in the room conveniently moved to the edge of the room hoping to be close enough to listen in but far enough away to be spared the wrath of either of them it was soulveig who finally broke the silence we are ulven child we are pack longfang honor and loyalty flow through our veins and give purpose to our charge  priestess you know what is happening is wrong i dont care about the honor debt we can send a hawk and discuss terms for the debt in the spring you know this could be a trick to remove our warriors from the war if we turn our backs on honor we are no better than the mordok i will hear no more of this nonsense rill you of all daughters here should know better than to even hint at straying from that course rill thought about the situation she thought about the consequences the words she had spoken in one final act of defiance she exhaled a forced sigh and softened her features she knew it would do her no good to argue with the runeseer i am sorry priestess i let anger and emotion get the best of me it will not happen again at that moment soulveig closed her eyes and squinted for a fraction of a second and opened them the shining light in her eyes was gone and she collapsed a bit from the strain of maintaining her meditation she coughed a few times and several daughters came over and helped her with a drink her eyes studied the runes she had cast in front of her concern spread across the runeseers face and she looked again as if willing the runes to speak a different message would actually make them change when she finally spoke she croaked the words through parched lips no no it isnt supposed to be like this priestess what do you see said rill as her own worry began to rise she had been training under the runeseer for quite some time now she had begun to learn how to read the runes and she could see the divination cast out before her  some members of pack longfang apparently were never meant to be sailors the first day on the open water saw fair weather and good travel as the stormjarl longships took them to stormjarl territory the second day however was a completely different story howling winds and a dusting of light snow raced to attack them finding ways to penetrate under their armor furs and cloaks once calm waters had turned into churning waves and a constant rocking motion that seemed to never end periodically a warrior of the longfangs would stumble over to the edge of the ship and wretch their stomachs into the oceans bryech savagefang and orrin kair recently traded to pack longfang from pack bloodfang were excited at the opportunity and the challenge to join the ranks of the elite longfangs now they sat huddled and miserable against the side of the ship gathered in their cloaks and spare clothing the conditions were terrible but no one spoke a word of discomfort for the longfang warriors were too well disciplined and the stormjarl sailors were at home even in these conditions harlok and azra sat opposite them showing less visible discomfort but obviously enduring just as brutal of conditions next to them and bundled in a thick wool cloak and still sporting the red face paint was the stormjarl emissary her task of summoning the longfangs and overseeing the claimant bar and the honor pledge was now complete and she was returning home five longships sailed in close formation to one another as the entire war pack of pack longfang was being sailed to clan stormjarls main settlement after several hours of harsh conditions the settlement became visible to the ships and the crew and the waters calmed as the snowstorm had passed longfang warriors stood on wobbly legs not accustom to sea travel and rose the cracking of ice on their cloaks and clothing audible to those on board the settlement of graytir stormjarl clanleader of clan stormjarl spanned out before them as they entered the port and prepared to dock their ships standing on the dock was a commanding looking ulven he was dressed in black and brow leathers and mail armor with an ornate sword sheathed at his side a thick mantle of what appeared to be bear fur sat on his shoulders his head was shaved tight and he wore a medium length and neatly trimmed black beard standing directly behind him in full armor and in formation were a dozen viknar these veteran warriors were the shock troops of the longships and honor guard to the different chieftans and priestesses of the clan although not quite as well trained as the elite longfangs they were very formidable nonetheless as the ships came to dock on both sides of the long pier the ulven greeted them proud and honorable warriors of pack longfang i am bolverk stormjarl warleader of clan stormjarl i welcome you to clan stormjarl territory and the settlement of graytir stormjarl clanleader of clan stormjarl  graytir stormjarl walked with purpose through the hallway leading into the great hall the mud and stone base of the hall was simple yet elegant wood carved with runes and knotwork traced along the edge of the ceiling and gave the building an even more profound setting the great hall of the clanleader was simple yet lavish in its design a beacon that could rival any other clan in size and aesthetic value wooden statues adorned both the halls and the steps leading up to the entrances clan stormjarl was wealthy and their great hall displayed this quite well behind him the noise of mail armor could be heard as two of the clanleaders personal viknar followed him outside it had started to snow any other season graytir would have stood quietly and admired the beauty in it from the balcony on the second or third floor of the great hall now it was just a reminder that his time was up and he had a hard decision to make graytir pushed the doors open to the main room in the great hall a massive chamber stretched out before him serving as an auditorium for meetings and gatherings where an entire assembly of chieftans and priestesses of his clan would normally meet to discuss matters of the clan every year now only a handful of them gathered near the front of the auditorium standing at the center of them was svayla hendray high priestess of stormjarl and mate to the clanleader graytir saw her and it warmed his heart although graytir was a good looking male ulven age and leadership had crinkled his features and started to put gray to his short hair and short trimmed beard his mate had aged well looking very lovely despite her only being a few seasons younger than him i wish we could greet you on more pleasant matters clanleader said bolverk stormjarl as always the warleader was adorned in blackish brown layers of leather and darkened mail several weapons were sheathed or hung in rings on him older than graytir the burly man was a master of melee combat and his muscles were taught and corded from decades of use constant practice and overseeing of the training of each chieftans viknar kept him much more youthful than his years would dictate pack longfang warriors have been brought to the settlement the emissary we sent confirmed that soulveig longfang upheld the honor debt without hesitation honor serves them and they are loyal to you good we are going to need them in the months ahead replied graytir as he walked in and stood next to his mate near a large table a few maps and some carved wooden warriors were placed on them in strategic areas i have received two letters just recently and felt that their words should be heard by all present here today before today the only letters that arrived were from some colonist group called agnosco i know their words angered us and were not well received but i dont think they truly speak for the colonists as a whole after months of very little word from any of the other clans these arrived by hawk this morning said the clanleader as he unrolled the first of two small letters and read them out loud in front of his audience free people of mardrun this may very well be my last correspondence the grimwards enemies of gaias ways who forsake her tenets and emulate the gruesome trophy taking and blasphemous rituals of the mordok have routed our troops and besiege our final settlement where for countless generations my people have faithfully guarded the western horizon as was our sacred duty the watchwolves of luna have waited nine months for relief and our staunchest of allies the longfangs faithfully held the pass through the wolfs hackles though we opened our halls to colonists and fellow clans and organized the grand alliance against the undead incursion our pleas for help have gone unanswered as three seasons have come to pass a wise elder once said the true warrior does not love the flashing blade for its sharpness nor does he love the black fletched arrow for its sharpness nor does he love the glory of war a true warrior cares not for these things a true warrior cares only for the ulven people the clan the pack and the family those are the only things worth dying for though the watchwolves of luna are hopelessly outnumbered and besieged i raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolves promise you that we will not waver in our pledge to gaias children we will perform our sacred duty to protect the western horizon even if we fall to the last soul we do not do it for glory we do it because we know that should we fall a powerful portent of the apocalypse will come to pass we do it not for ourselves we do it not for selfish glory we do it for all the free people of mardrun we do it for the future of all ulven we give it our all because some things are worth dying for elders of stormjarl by the time you read this message it may very well be too late for my people but i urge you to look inwards in your chests beat the hearts of true warriors figuring out the right thing to do is always easy but finding the courage to do so is another matter entirely be brave my friends be brave the eyes and ears of the great wolf are upon you and you will be judged signed by my hand this day raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolves said graytir as he put down the first letter and unrolled the second letter before continuing to my brothers and sisters of clan stormjarl about five decades ago your clan believed in my pack so strongly that you helped us set up our lives on the edge of the world an action that other packs and clans thought foolish and for five decades we still stand at the swamp our warriors have protected every clan at one time or another because we are one ulven people and that was the path gaia had set our feet to gaias path is not always easy and we all will have great loss at times we know that if we walk this path that our deeds will ring in the great wolfs ears my father was dennagrath stormjarl a carpenter ship builder and warrior of pack longfang one thing he taught me was that as ulven one thing we should never give up is our honor and he told me that clan stormjarl was a clan of honor but now we find our race in strange times ulven killing ulven and you are not in a safe place your people look to you for guidance and you stand before the maw of grimward you have three choices one give in to grimward let them use you as they stray from gaias path and you will be known as the lap dog of grimward win or lose that will always be the case you asked for our aid and we sent it if you join them your actions will look to every one as a trick to take the longfangs out of the fight even if that is not your intent two stay neutral no ulven should have to give up honor because other clans say they will kill you if you dont the longfangs would gladly stand and fight defending a clan that stood up to grimward your honor would stay and we could buy you time if you chose to evacuate your people if need be with the promises that we will one day return you to your home three join nightriver in defending the humans your clan is strong and wealthy your skills with ships unmatched and i know you can see the advantage of having humans here to trade with from what i have heard you are a wise leader and have already tried to trade with the colonists your goldwood coins are in the hands of many people ulven and colonist alike i am not saying that they are all good i am saying that they are like pups in need of a chance to grow we cannot give them that if as ulven we just kill them some have proven honorable and even now some march to aid the watchwolves like any honorable pack or clan would do if their friends were in need you gave my pack a chance look at the path gaia laid before your feet do you really feel that siding with a group that is so driven by hate that they will kill their own kind to seek vengeance the graytide had killed with out mercy in this quest human syndar and ulven the elders and the pups they take trophies fingers and ears even the fangs of other ulven in a way i under stand what khulgar graytide had lost my first mate was killed in the war with humans as was my father but peace was made every dead human syndar and ulven is one less to fight our real enemy which is the mordok of this the great wolf would be right to forget our names you must of course do what you know to be right for not only you but for your people so i ask if you do join with clan grimward that you show every one that you are not a trickster and dishonorable and to return our warriors stanrick longfang warrior of pack longfang an intense silence filled the room everyone attending made sure to listen intently everyone attending made sure to think thoroughly about what was said it was finally the warleader who spoke clanleader these letters are full of inspiring words and of reminders of honor but i feel that it is too late now where were they months ago where was the pledge of support and the actions to back them nightriver is wise not to cross the river and attack clan grimward in their own lands but the complete lack of any backing to these claims of support means we have to look out for the survival of our people warleader you would have us take a side in this war i know our clan has always had good relations with grimward but to side with them they openly started this war and are going to throw us into a fight that would dishonor our entire race replied one of the assembled chieftans pup you see only what your young eyes can perceive directly in front of you look around what support do we have from clan nightriver what support do we have from the rest of the clans if not for the honor debt to pack longfang we would have no aid at all and that is only a couple dozen warriors you heard the words from raskolf vakr on that letter the western settlement of the watchwolves is under siege haygreth pushes north and is winning if we turn against grimward we will share their same fate enough please we need to discuss this openly between us i know the other chieftans are not here to voice their opinions and concerns but i have been given their support to act on their behalf they are tending to their packs and their villages and preparing for our decision one way or another interrupted the clanleader svalya what news from the emissaries clanleader they have reported to me directly and we have discussed numerous topics related to each side of this conflict clan nightriver promises support and aid but we have not seen any evidence of this clan grimward promises support and aid and has already proven they are willing and able to give it we have had no chance to discuss matters with the colonists or any of their settlements the letter we sent to the settlement of new aldoria during the humans market faire went unanswered and our daughter is still missing replied svayla in an authoritative tone until the last part of it where her voice wavered with emotion the other clans underestimate haygreth i have known him for many years and he is not the brute that others believe him to be he knows what he is doing he has planned this out and he has something that other clans do not conviction he has put plans in motion as others sit and talk we are even guilty of it i respect the watchwolves for their decision to back nightriver but they now suffer for it said graytir clanleader the other chieftans have sent word over the last few months clan grimward waits at our borders for our decision they have not been hostile they have even been helpful and respectful of stormjarl territory but we cannot be fooled the mobilization of these war packs is no coincidence they wait for the command from haygreth and his warleader replied one of the chieftans that very topic was on everyones mind as haygreth made no attempt to hide the warriors he was gathering at the stormjarl borders it was an obvious tactic to try to sway their decision i know one of the reasons why some of the other chieftans are not here is because they are seeing to the defenses of some of their settlements we have never needed to stockpile weapons and food and build defenses for our villages from mordok attack let alone try to prepare for war clanleader if we oppose clan grimward and we receive no support from clan nightriver we cant win their war packs are trained and seasoned warriors it is well known that they are willing to push brutality to extremes against the mordok our people are not prepared to be the target of that said another chieftan emotion filled his voice and it was no surprise his packs village was located near the border between the two clans and would probably suffer first if the two clans went to war the discussion continued for a bit as other chieftans and even the priestesses started to chime in and try to speak their mind graytir thought about calming them but felt that allowing them to speak was the right choice this continued for a couple minutes and started to die down clanleader we must make preparations for either decision if we join grimward in war the chieftans can supply grimward warriors with longships that can sail anywhere on the continent we would be able to land their warriors on any coast or river on mardrun this mobility would allow them to attack and raid almost any clan and even attack the colonists directly if we support them this way it would be the safest way to involve our people in this war which means an end can be found and peace can be made on the other hand if we side with nightriver the longships will not be of much use if we are defending our homes the border we share is too big and controlling the river and coasts will do nothing for grimward warriors marching across our lands we may be able to bring allies to our coast and have them assist with the fight and we can patrol the river and keep the bridges open so supplies and allies can come through control of those bridges will be key in bringing in any support from nightriver or the colonists but that is also assuming we actually get the support we are promised said bolverk as he laid out the tactics related to joining both sides of the war clanleader i know this decision is difficult but we need to look out for the survival of our people  graytir opened the thick oaken door to his personal chambers svayla followed him in and closed the door allowing the two privacy graytir walked through the lavish and decorated room to the large windows that overlooked his settlement he was deep in thought and svayla could sense his emotions my mate i know you are troubled talk to me svayla what is happening how could we the ulven allow things to get to where they are for generations our people have settled our disputes and focused on the real enemy to the north or worked together to expand our settlements it is almost as if we have completely forgotten them and turned inward to tear our own throats out i dont know what to do my love i am scared for the future said graytir as his resolve was fully assaulted by what was happening around him now that they were in private his defenses were down sensing that this weight threatened to crush him svayla walked up and put a reassuring hand on his back and his arm and stayed close to him graytir you earned your place as clanleader you know this and so does everyone in this clan the chieftans stand by you and know that you will look out for them they trust your judgment even if the decisions that lay ahead are difficult your people are with you are they i mean are they really willing to live and die by my decision it is easy to look at those maps and talk about honor but when the war is at our doorstep and blades are drawn and blood is spilled i am not so sure haygreth will not just go away if we decide to join clan nightriver and the other clans may look at us with shame for joining the first clan to start a war with our people said graytir as he turned and looked his mate in the eye svayla could see the anguish and torment behind his features i dont know what the right answer is my love what decision am i to make svayla paused a moment and looked at her mate she took his hands in her own and held his gaze the one you believe in she said as she leaned in and kissed him  as dawn broke across the horizon and welcomed the new day the light flowed across the plains that lay outstretched before the northernmost village of clan stormjarl normally the farmers and fishermen would greet the dawn and go about their work as other villagers would awaken and begin their daily lives on any normal day the sunrise would have been beautiful today the sunlight glinted off of weapons and armor from almost two hundred warriors assembled in a field just outside the village warriors stood in formation opposing each other and stared in silence to the north dozens of warriors in leather and furs with gray sashes stood next to more warriors standing in full mail and layered armor wearing the gray braid of pack graytide some had painted their faces with dark masks and lines and wore their bloody trophies taken from their fallen enemies from previous battles to the south stood a perfect formation of viknar in matching helm mail and shields their prestine armor and rehearsed formation making them seem rather impressive if not for their constant training giving proof to their skill their unscathed look would have been viewed as pompous or the mark of a unit that does not actually see battle next to them in an impressive shield wall stood the warriors of pack longfang with furs and leathers that looked well battle worn their experience and fearlessness earned them a formidable reputation and their presence during this meeting was no mistake standing in front of the longfangs and viknar was graytir and bolverk opposite them in front of the grimwards and graytides stood haygreth and khulgar graytide i graytir stormjarl clanleader of clan stormjarl and bolverk stormjarl warleader of clan stormjarl greet you said graytir in the usual greeting of the ulven i haygreth grimward clanleader of clan grimward and khulgar graytide chieftan of pack graytide accept your greeting khulgar is here as an advisor to my warleader for they are unable to attend this meeting said haygreth in rehearsed formality bolverk and khulgar stood opposite of each other and one step behind their respective leader they knew that this meeting was between graytir and haygreth and their voices would remain silent the civil war continues to rage across mardrun graytir the colonists have deceived clan nightriver and branthur has abandoned his ulven ways and allowed himself to be manipulated i come to you today to ask for your support in bringing peace to mardrun said haygreth haygreth our clans go back for generations your warriors have diligently protected your lands from roving tribes of mordok and in doing so it has helped protect my people as well we have grown strong and wealthy and i know we owe your clan gratitude in helping us achieve this we have respected your ways and you have respected ours you know that we have been involved with the colonists in the last few years and learned from them why do you wish death on them the outsiders brought death with them you saw the letters but you did not see the destruction the hungry ghosts that forced the outsiders to flee their home followed them here and cut a path of destruction across half of the continent they lied about it being here and only when pressed did their pathetic coalition track it down and stop it they buried their dead in the soil of gaia and disrespected our ways and the hungry ghosts came to claim them here on our homeland that is a path of death that i refuse to let my people walk down graytir there is magic that the ulven have never seen before and i believe that branthur is being deceived by it that they are forcing his hand and allowing more transgressions against us to take place without proper control even the watchwolf clan so level and wise drafted a resolution to allow ulven to control the colonists and it was not followed they too were deceived and now they fight against us but we will prevail and show them that their actions are foolish in time the watchwolves will learn the truth you mean to say that in time you will conquer them snapped graytir not giving in to haygreth the quip had its affect and the pleasant and professional demeanor of haygreth began to crumble if they fail to see the truth and lose sight of the honor of our race and our charge to protect gaia then they are not the ulven i have sworn to protect i stand before you today brother and ask that you join me clan whiteoak has pledged their fealty to me to help end this war other clans have expressed their concerns about the colonists and will join our cause as well our clans can protect gaia and bring the other clans back from their deception of the outsiders before it is too late clan whiteoak is the clan that shamed themselves by being dishonorable using trickery to try to destroy the village of pack longfang entering a village under guest right and using it to spring a trap are the actions of ulven that have fallen off of gaias path word travels fast across mardrun whether you agree with its message or not i would dishonor my clan by siding with them the two men glared at each other it was obvious that both of them had words that they wanted to be sure were heard before this meeting was over after an uncomfortable silence haygreth spoke it is the actions of the brave and the daring those that are willing to take measures that others are not that will save our people from the destruction that lies ahead but enough talk we both know why we are here you have a decision to make and an answer to give me you are correct haygreth there is a decision to make i graytir stormjarl clanleader of clan stormjarl proclaim that my clan will not join you in this war we will lobby for peace and help end this conflict but we will not join you in your conquest graytir was on the verge of shaking not from the cold but from his nervousness but maintained his composure he was expecting haygreths angered response and was taken by surprise when haygreth smiled at him clanleader i ask that you think of the safety of your people throwing in your lot with the outsiders would dishonor you in front of the eyes of the great wolf you can support my warriors with your longships and help us maintain supplies so that we can end this war for good we will make the fallen clans understand the corruption of the outsiders and take back our homeland before it is too late we stand on the verge of an apocalypse and the decisions of a few brave leaders will save our people i ask you again brother to join me and make things right said haygreth in a smooth and even tone the delivery was flawless and it was disarming graytir cleared his throat and tried to think he was surprised at how easy it was to believe in haygreths cause his words were so convincing and they made sense however he did not want the outsiders to die he wanted them controlled better but he wanted a more peaceful resolution he began to doubt his initial stance and his defenses dropped and haygreth saw it the moment it happened we are ulven brother this is our homeland what right do they have to it graytir do not allow yourself to be deceived by the outsiders suddenly the memory of several nights previously rushed back to graytir svayla was looking directly at him and told him to make the decision that he believed in he remembered the strength it gave him he blinked and locked eyes with haygreth his resolve coming back to him you are right haygeth i will not be deceived by the outsiders i will also not have my hand forced by you your words are twisted haygreth if you think that i will allow my people to help spread such brutality and destruction then you are wrong i am the leader of stormjarl i am the voice of my people and i will not join you haygreth grimward this time haygreth did not smile he focused and narrowed his gaze on graytir his temper flaring but just barely being held in check if you are not with me graytir stormjarl then you are against me you are a fool i know you have met with emissaries from both sides of this war i know that you have calculated out the risks of joining either side i know that you have sent hawks to the other clans to ask for help even if their words were disguised i know that your chieftans are building up the defenses of your villages because they are not built to withstand war i know that you are gambling on clan nightriver sending the support that i am sure they have promised you graytir stood his ground refusing to back down but unable to respond proud silence was all that he could muster at that moment you forget brother that i am far better at this than you are come spring thaw you will either be judged by the great wolf or you will bear your throat to me i will either destroy you and take your ships and your villages or you will pledge fealty to me and they will be mine it makes no difference to me i gave you a chance to decide what was best for your clan pity you did not make the wise one graytir somehow found the courage to speak and looked haygreth straight in the eye you did give me a chance to decide and i have made my choice let it be known that on this day clan stormjarl took the honorable route and made our own decision on this war on this day we were not coerced we were not deceived and we were not forced into making a choice that we did not want to make on this day we walked our own path with our heads held high even if our backs were against a wall both of the leaders took a moment to glare at each other it was obvious that neither one of them was backing down and that they both had set their mind to the decisions they were going to make i know that you are worried about the survival of your people graytir you should be said haygreth with finality as he turned around and walked back to his lines the meeting was apparently over graytir stood there for a moment and watched haygreths hulking form walk back towards his lines khulgar had locked eyes with him for a moment before turning and following his clan leader graytir then turned and walked back towards his own lines with bolverk by his side i am sorry bolverk that i did not take your advice shut that nonsense and take back your apology clanleader if you think i wont follow you into the maw of death itself then you dont know me very well you made a choice and i support you we all do now let us prepare for war said bolverk under his breath so the line of troops in front of them could not hear them it was reassuring to know that bolverk would follow him but it didnt help ease the horrible knot in graytirs stomach all he could think about was how it was going to be a long and brutal winter  the halfday trip back to the grimward camp just on the other side of the border was rather quiet khulgar did not dare to say anything and allowed his leader time to think he knew that haygreth was not surprised for plans were already in motion if clan stormjarl joined with nightriver and the outsiders he also knew that graytir and haygreth were friends years ago that they had feasted at each others great hall and made plans to expand and grow their respective settlements even if the plans were in motion and preparations already made he knew this was hard on haygreth when they reached the camp an ulven scout with two winter hawks was already waiting for haygreth send the hawks make sure the first one reaches our main warrior camp so that it reaches the whiteoaks quickly the second must reach the river immediately said haygreth the ulven falconer nodded and attached a small letter to each hawk the words were already written and prepared the falconer simply needing confirmation from haygreth to send them the falconer took the small blinding helmet off the first hawk locked eyes with the bird and whistled a few small chirps at it and threw it into the air to the north the same process was repeated for the second bird but the chirps were different than the first the second bird was then released to the east haygreth then walked towards his small command tent so it begins sighed khulgar as he watched his leader leave he turned to walk away when the falconer spoke to him chieftain i received a hawk today with a message for you it is from the watchwolf clan it bears the mark of the high priestess herself said the falconer as he presented a small rolled up letter to khulgar  jeyfa shadowfang was in a sour mood she had been ordered to move to the yurnai river and wait it had been three days and she grew tired of these cold conditions and iron rations she occupied herself with meditation and practiced her witchcraft her small group of five grimward bodyguards were tired and cold as they did all they could to keep from freezing to death recently a war pack of clan grimward had pushed across the bridge and secured the opposite side that was over a month ago fighting had broken out since as the clan nightriver war packs on the other side responded to them but it was sporadic and light if everything went according to plan then the other bridges should be secured soon as well now she just had to wait jeyfa and her guards heard the sound of horns and the shouts of battle apparently there was a fierce fight taking place on the opposite side of the river clan nightriver must have sent more warriors to the bridge to take back their side of it a grimward scout recently had reported to her that the main bridge was still under grimward control and that the two closest bridges were taken as well jeyfa heard a screech as a hawk descended from the sky and swooped in fast she extended her forearm to reveal to the bird a falconers bracer and the bird slowed rapidly it landed on her forearm as the birds talons latched onto the hardened leather perch she fed it a mouse and it ate its meal ferociously taking the small note from its body she read the letter and handed off the bird to one of her guards warriors get up it is time she said as she started walking towards the bridge her bodyguards scrambled to gather gear and put on the last pieces of equipment and gather their weapons and shields they knew that getting so close to the river could draw the attention of archers and they wanted to protect the witch daughter wait we need to wait for reinforcements before we cross shouted the leader of her war pack as they caught up to her and formed a defensive wall around her just at that moment an arrow arced into the sky and planted itself in the shield of one of the bodyguards we arent crossing clear that off and get in replied jeyfa as the group came upon a fishing boat it was camouflaged and stashed by the bank of the river as the warriors worked to dislodge the boat and get in jeyfa saw a sliver of light glint off of an arrow as it pierced through the sky she thought that the scout on the other side of the river was either very skilled or very lucky the closest guard tried to react in time but was too late as the arrow whistled through the air and was in a direct line with the witchs chest it would have pierced her heart or lungs but at the very last moment the flicker of a blue aura around the witch flashed the arrow deflected sharply and snapped the broken pieces of the arrow landed harmlessly in the snow around her no command was needed to be said for failing to protect the witch would mean certain death for her guards with renewed vigor the guards surrounded her with a tight formation overlapping the shields and creating a wall of stretched leather and wood to protect her from further arrows the small boat floated into the river the current was not very strong at this part of the river but it still threatened to take the boat downstream if not for a rope that kept it tethered to part of the bridge two more arrows sunk into the shield wall around the witch the warriors were concerned about how to maintain their defensive wall and keep their footing on a boat that was now rocking in the river approaching one of the support columns in the center of the bridge the aged and hardened wood had stood for decades and withstood everything that the river had thrown at it the witch concentrated and began to channel forth a flow of mana an orb of intense red formed in her outstretched hand and she flicked her wrist out and sent the bolt crashing into the wooden column a great crack split the air as the bolt shattered the wood and exploded sending shards of wood sailing into the air before they splashed into the water over and over the witch summoned forth the energy to shatter more columns and blast apart more of the supports holding the bridge up more arrows landed into the shield wall one of her guards was struck in the thigh and grunted in pain but he knew better than to drop his guard his blood oozed down his pant leg another guard cried out as an arrow deflected off the edge of his shield and lodged itself into his collar bone quickly soaking his leather jerkin in steaming hot blood none of the guards moved or lowered their shield wall suddenly there was a loud crack followed by a serious of low cracks that rose in frequency and volume as the bridge groaned under the assault jeyfa paused panting from the exertion of summoning forth so many bolts of magic and waited like a giant tree being taken down for lumber the bridge started to give way and the columns cracked open the weight of the massive bridge was now working against it as the weakened columns buckled and split open knowing her part of this job was complete the daughter used a dagger to cut loose the rope keeping the boat tethered to the bridge the stress of the bridge giving way buckled the solid beams making up its road and they split apart spilling into the river in a few moments the largest bridge connecting clan grimward and clan nightriver the bridge that had seen hundreds if not thousands of caravans and was the fastest way to transport people and supplies across the river crumbled completely and fell into the river jeyfa shadowfang smiled as the boat floated downstream and away from the final destruction of the bridgedivided we fall  old aldoria many years ago  everyone was on edge which was exactly what she had expected the older boys sharpened what weapons they had found or stolen some of them only had butchers knives but they looked sharp enough and so did the young men wielding them younger members scuttled about the peach street house with a speed that always meant danger delivering messages and running errands in silence the usual jumble of jokes and pointless squabbles had hushed it was a house full of young men silent and serious as the grave a young girl in a pretty pink dress ryla would have seemed out of place except that she shared a certain lean sharpness a ruthlessness born of wanting with the rest of the gang at the rear of the house in the room he used for an office she could hear thomas bellowing at someone a small boy in cloths two sizes too big finished a mug of some kind of terrible beer and bounded over to her you going to see the boss thats the plan you seem giddy not worried about going up against rogers boys nah everybody knows toms the smart one well wipe the floor with them one of the older boys ryla thought his name was rowen shot him a dirty look if rogers really the two bit back biter tommy thinks he is which im not saying he is just   its okay james i know what you were saying obviously someones expecting a fight the boy had a tiny knife someone had nicked for him strapped to his belt as though he would actually know how to use it he was a decent cut purse but hed never killed a flea and not for a lack of them james she leaned in and whispered to him producing a few coins from her purse why dont you pop over to old wallaces pub and get a bottle of that gut rot thomas likes might calm him down he looked apprehensive i have to be here for the brawl i know i know i think youve got a little time though she pulled out a few more coins probably even enough time to get yourself something sweet on the way back it wasnt possible but his eyes grew a size bigger and he snatched the coins from her greedily yes maam and he was off down the hall thomas opened the door screaming what in the hell   oh hi ryla get in here he pulled her into his office and set about pacing it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous marcus tell her what you told me thomas lieutenant shot ryla a tortured look roger claims that he found evidence that thomas took advantage of helen helen that girl he keeps around thomas laughed mirthlessly yeah of all the idiotic crap he could accused me of after everything all his plotting and scheming he accuses me of    of what stealing his woman i swear my brother is king of the lunatic morons it might not be what it seems thomas have you tried talking to him maybe this has all been a misunderstanding you know how boys are they spread rumors they blow things out of proportion thomas smiled and stopped for a moment to pat her on the head oh little ryla you always think the best of people some day youre going to have to grow up or the world is going to eat you alive but maybe youre right did you get the letter from gregory if he has good news there might still be hope for us all ryla nodded lifting it to him reluctantly he snatched it and read feverishly then he read it again every second that passed it seemed his face fell further finally he collapsed into his broken down desk chair no i think were passed talking little one the letter confirms everything i suspected of him ill have to kill him for this his mind must have been whirling he was counting his allies and making strategies the destruction of his brother was to be handled with swiftness but prudence roger had never been big on planning there was a racket at the front of the house as it got closer it was obviously the sounds of battle or what a group of wretched street thugs call battle anyway there was a pounding on the door and a bloodied young man burst into the room rogers here hes brought all his men with him thomas leaped to his feet and grabbed his long blade he stopped just short of the door and went back to ryla here he led her to a closet hide well make short work of him and then ill be back he gave her a peck on the forehead and was gone  new aldoria 262 winters doorstep  ryla suspected the room was supposed to seem simple and rustic a deers head hung over the mantle the mantle and furnishings were made of some dark rich wood she didnt know the name of sanded and polished to an unearthly smoothness she took a seat in one of the chairs next to the fire they may have lacked ornamentation but they were still royal chairs deep and soft they werent merely comfortable they wrapped her in comfort she actually nodded off for a moment am i interrupting the voice was smooth and unconcerned with only the slightest hint of disapproval her eyes flew open and she shot up then down again in her best imitation of a curtsey it must have looked ridiculous in her traveling clothes aylin looked very much at home his cloths matched the rest of the estate the richest form of rustic shed ever seen his simple hunting clothes could have kept garrow and his men appointed for a half year forgive me your highness it was a long trip back from onsallas he waved off the honorific and took his own seat next to the fire then youve only just now arrived nice of you to come straight here tea id love some your schedule is no doubt fuller than mine when the prince has time to see you you make time to see him she settled back down on the edge of the chair and how is the outpost did your business there go well aylin produced an intricate pipelong and silver with an bizarre valve systemand began to pack the bowl yes it went very well thrand did sort of threaten to cut off my fingers and send me out to the mordok she chuckled but a deep frown crossed the princes face barbarous to treat a guest like that he took a few puffs i think that was mostly a misunderstanding anyway i should have your share of the profits to you presently im sorry i wasnt able to respond to your letter about the lumber the prince waved the pipe to the side leaving a rippling trail of smoke behind im sorry i couldnt wait for you there is however still a load if your ship is able to take it it would be our pleasure were likely going to work onsallas into our route at some point she looked at him sidelong he was fiddling with a valve on the pipe it was at least half ruse though meant to disarm her she smiled your highnesss generosity has been the greatest help to me and my cohorts even when weve paid you for the ship i feel as though we will still owe you a debt he didnt rise to the flattery instead he occupied himself with his tea cup onsallas was enlightening though they may be barbarous but it seems even the mighty ulven occasionally need help with trade i met a woman there as well named sorcha a business woman whos had trouble finding reliable transport for her goods it certainly seems i picked the right occupation they exchanged a pleasant smile but before he could comment she continued on if we survive the winter ill have more opportunities than i know what to do with if we survive the winter he somehow managed to be patronizing but likable thats a bit dramatic dont you think oh yes of course i dont buy into all the hype about the war either the peasants ramble on about the grimward coming for their children at night even my own mercenaries blather on about it youd think the grimward were monsters and not just ulven i mean whats another war right aldorias been through worse itll weather this all the same perhaps come out better for it as everyone around us wastes themselves fighting to his credit aylins face remained pleasant and neutral weve done what we can to aid our ulven supporters weve been helping by moving goods to the colony at an extremely fair price and new aldoria has been a host to numerous soldiers and warriors of the ulven in their journeys the gates are always open in new aldoria for allies naturally your highness new aldoria is nothing if not supportive of its allies surely youve done everything within your power id expect nothing less from so great a man stop it he set the pipe down and looked her in the eye stop what your highness this he said in a measured tone so quiet ryla found herself leaning in to hear this double talk is that all ive earned from you what exactly did you come here to get from me for a moment he let her consider they measured each other ryla dropped her gaze in deference id like you to increase your support of the war effort and you thought youd do that by talking me around instead of just asking me im not used to people simply giving me things because i asked for them she could feel him watching her but she kept her eyes down she tried to seem respectful maybe even pitiable who is honesty isnt a virtue because its easy ryla ive had just about enough plotting for oh a lifetime best luck to you miss larksfield he rose to leave prince aylin please stop she put as much command into her voice as she dared praying it still came off as respectful he eased himself back down into his chair and leaned in okay lets start over what do you want she sighed then looked him flatly in the eye i want you to commit troops to the war he eased back into his chair picking up his pipe and regaining some measure of his genial attitude why perhaps because if the grimward win were all doomed still being dramatic hardly the ulven only seem to tolerate us even our closest allies i believe the grimward intend to wipe us off the map and if they win theyll rally the rest of the ulven to their cause we need to support our allies now more than ever before the stormjarl are poised to make their decision and at this point it looks as though they arent going to stick their necks out for us i cant even say that i blame them all i know is things are coming to a head this war will be over soon one way or another he nodded you make an excellent point the smile was only slightly mocking see was that so hard so youll commit troops no im sorry i cant commit our troops and leave the farms and families of new aldoria defenseless it just isnt an option but   a second ago i was so great a manyou might have a little faith theres more to fighting a war than how many men youve got youre aldorian too you should know that theres some belt tightening we can do around here i can commit some extra supplies to the men already fighting a moment of silence passed while she considered disappointed it isnt the sort of aid i came here hoping for but it will help thank you youre welcome id been considering the matter for some time everyone has an opinion everyone has a solution i appreciate your input dont give me that look im hardly the sort of person who advises royalty on a regular basis im fairly certain thats my call to make incidentally there was something else i wanted to ask you about oh as you may know i recently funded mercenaries for an expedition into the dirge swamp it didnt   go well thats one way to put it the prince gave her a grim look at the remark and she took a long sip of tea as cover he continued i believe someone paid them to betray me if you can give me some clue as to who that might be id gladly make it worth your while id heard a rumor to that effect it seems the most likely explanation unfortunately i dont have any insight into what kind of a motherless asshole would do such a thing pardon my vandregonian if i do hear anything ill tell you directly thank you its obviously someone of means perhaps another noble who can tell politics remains the same ruthless vipers nest its always been he gave her another appraising look it can be very difficult to tell who has your best interests at heart but enough of this dreary banter tell me more about these ulven to the north replied the prince as a genuine smile crossed his face  old aldoria  ryla imagined spending a few hours in a closet was pretty horrible even without a bunch of people killing each other outside when it grew quiet and two confused looking town guards opened the door it was as near a godsend as anything shed ever experienced what who are you me im the person your boss sent you to find right little girl big mouth likely hiding in the house somewhere thatd be me when they stared at her stupidly for a minute too long she coached them further youre boss is looking for me translated into idiot that means bring me to guardsman wright wright was the sort of man who looked more frightening than he was he was big as a house with fists the size of the hams they served at the barons banquets or so ryla imagined he was standing in the midst of the carnage that was now the main room giving his men orders in a calm and almost fatherly tone the corpses of foolish young men draped over what remained of their poorly kept earthly processions he started when he saw her damned fools this is no place for a little girl get her out of here ryla ducked the quicker of the two fools escorting her and paced to their captain over her erstwhile comrades i trust things went according to plan he frowned but resigned himself to allowing her to stay just as you said they nearly wiped each other out we didnt lose a man never seen anything like it wouldnt believe it if i hadnt seen it two of the most notorious criminals in the low streets beaten by a little girl she snorted they beat themselves and thomas he shifted uncomfortably dead tried to surrender bad business that but   a promise is a promise ryla finished i need to see him he looked a bit sick thats no sight for a young lady if i see one around here ill tell her where is he he pointed to a corner of the room sure enough thomas and marcus lay cold on the floor long crimson gashes marked their throats she closed her eyes but waited a moment to turn back to wright bad business he repeated even for dogs like them must have done something terrible to you ryla supposed good men were always protective of little girls part of their nature no she picked up a flute one of the boys used to play on boring nights and fiddled with it absently never did me wrong she seemed to catch herself and tossed the pipe aside and he never will i meant what i said thomas is one of the most brilliant and cruel men in the city was she corrected pointedly would you betray a man like that and let him live to pay you back no i suppose not neither would i he said nothing shifting uncomfortably she let the moment drag enjoying his unease well he finally spouted smiling to hide his discomfort it seems the guard should certainly offer you their thanks not really they should forget i exist she turned to leave that was the whole point after all  new aldoria 262  the street was very dark and quiet few people ventured out at night this time of year ryla waited by the front door for a moment it was a long walk back from the princes estate she breathed out slowly watching the cloud of steam rise into the dark it felt like shed been holding her breath all day her hands shook and it had nothing to do with the cold there was laughter from inside dishes clinked and the smell of a cooked bird of some kind wafted out to the street shed fought for things before respect comfort power when she was young and lean and angry she had thought shed do anything to get ahead she liked fighting dirty it had become comfortable for her the door opened enveloping her in warmth and light duncan reached out and pulled her into the house    standing out there like an idiot he finished saying to someone else he took her cloak and put a mug of warm cider in her hand so how was meeting the prince weve met him before nighen corrected from across the room she was helping ty do something with herbs an occupation he left in her hands so he could meet ryla at the door and give her a long hug and friendly kiss it was fine i guess he wont commit troops but he is going to send extra supplies so thats something she enjoyed the calming weight of tys arms around her shoulders hes clever i like him duncan nodded but the instant he opened his mouth erin was there with a plate of food for ryla she doesnt want to hear your political ramblings right now dear she winked at ryla shes had a long trip let the girl rest duncan was about to complain until erin decided to distract him with a kiss ryla made her way to a chair next to the fire and began eating quietly nighen continued with a story shed obviously been telling before ryla had interupted so were carrying all this stuff to the outpost and these two mordok show up out of nowhere well ryla wasnt about to let them go that easy she dropped the chest she was carrying and hit them with the highest pitched girliest scream i have ever heard it was impressive you should be so proud of your student duncan when duncan could breath again he gasped no no no there was this one time outside of new hope   dont you dare tell that story ryla warned and there was this farmer and his damned cow ryla resigned herself and sat listening to him recount her most embarrassing moments as a mercenary outside the night grew colder and darkeryawn had listened though the request itself had shocked him who the hell would ask him  him  of all people to train troops to raise warriors hed become comfortable being the outsider being out of the call to serve beyond that of shieldmen he was aware of it after it was lost hed probably be in more discussions had he not stepped off the path he may yet wind his way back onto that path but    but the only thing that had mattered to him then was being a warrior proving himself having found it so soon at such cost    that had broken something in him he could kill he could wound he was skilled in it but    but all the skill in the world with sword spear mace ax and shield could not mend wounds could not cure poison or sickness could not set a broken bone or pop a joint back in place he knew hed gone a bit mad after the raid on the outpost after the massed attack on onsallas in those days of loss days of blood and thunder hed gone mad mad with loss mad with lament it was then he had slowly realized what it was he wanted most of all to end the dying to pull his friends back from the brink to protect to heal and he was willing then for the first time in his life to question what hed been raised to be all his life moreso after the death of his mother the very night he came face to face with the ghosts that walked when hed thrown a boulder at the lich thinking hed cornered a mordok straggler hed already step off the path by then    but that night he fixed it in his mind to keep as many of his friends and family alive as he could then it was not about could he cast    hed passed that barrier    but to keep his and his own safe to grind the dead to dust to have a means to fight them yes yes skill with the weapon mattered but the blessing tied to it gave the arm wielding it the means to end the undead that became his new mark his new goal his everything the day was cool as warm as it would get he stood abreast kreigerthe details had slipped his mind the moment kreiger had asked him to train up his new warpack the snow had not yet dusted the ground though the frost was gaining footholds slow and sure siren siren had already set off with her lot of green wolflings the evening before yawn did not envy them she would make warriors of them or she would gut them trying to do it kreiger spoke at last and the murmuring crowd at once fell mute yawn felt the hard stares and meet them keeping his face relaxed unlike his niece and brother yawns fury burned cold as you know yawn longfang is your new packmate ive asked him to train you ive asked him to harden you the longfang have stood with us from the start many of you know his brother stannrick and cousin harlock kreiger paused letting his pack murmur for a moment at those names shooting a quick grin in yawns direction yawn    yawn shot back a quick grimace just a bit mortified kreiger would mention his relationship to convince them that he was worth listening to the odd male who picked up magic from the green one yawn made a note to listen more to raskolf on matter of diplomacy mostly he waited for a command or a clear opportunity kreiger spoke again i will be leaving to aid the watchwolves who like the longfang have stood and bled beside us again the murmuring came but one voice    one carried over the others  a harsh deliberate huh umbra    umbra a brawler of some note in the pit and an ongoing pain in kreigers backside by reflex kreiger fought not to roll his eyes this would be trouble he had a pack of wolves by nature they would question youve something to say then yawn called out before kreiger had a chance to speak umbra who stood a halfhead above the crowd grinned like a loon and shouted ive a great deal to say on this longfang first of all yawn was grateful siren wasnt here the pair might scrap like brother and sister but gaia and the great wolf pity the fool stupid enough to threaten or insult either in front of the other yawn forced himself to relax hed didnt have the skill that others did in speech but hed listened to those who did though in these situations he so seldom did well then speak your heart before its bitterness poisons you for once yawn had a plan umbra swaggered forward the crowd parting some pup some crazed pup they send to teach us some pup that can cast and thinks himself a warrior yawn kept his face neutral but didnt avert his eyes he couldnt allow his eyes to roll or brow to raise quit circling the fire and come to your point its too damn cold to stand around hurling insults umbras eyes lit up anyone could do better then you yawn grinned knowing damn well it would drive umbra mad if you feel so strongly about it then challenge me that was all the bait yawn needed to draw umbra in umbra bellowed his reply eyes flashing with anger i challenge you for the right to train the bloodfangs to  yawn cut off umbra as this is an honor duel the old ways say i choose the terms first blood or first fall choose your weapon yawn strode for the rack unclasping his winter cloak as he did but did not shrug it off clenching his hands he rolled his wrists popping his knuckles and thumbs he turned aside a few shields plucked a heavy round strap shield from the lot taking it up by the strap shaking it hard to be certain the straps remained stout noting umbras choice of a great sword yawn strode to the clear flat patch umbra looked on a bit confused arent you going to choose a weapon yawn replied only i have chosen kreiger if youd call the start and finish of the match kreiger nodded in agreement that i can do then in a softer voice he asked yawn what in the hell are you doing as he strode toward the pair trust me in this kreiger better now then when youre away kreiger took a moment to confer with umbra and yawn rolled his shoulders raising the shield to the guard position kreiger withdrew positioning himself in the ring his pack mates were still forming and murmuring he raise his arms and loudly called out fight umbra rushed in blade arching over his head a guttural war cry sounding yawn lunged to meet him shield high his right hand closing over his cloaks collar out of sight of his foe and the crowd umbra brought the blades weight to bear as yawn punched with the shield the pommel of the sword ringing as the blow echoed off the stout oak of the shields slats and the edge of yawns shield connected with umbras shoulder the shield heavier then any mace or hammer the cornerstone of yawns gambit umbra cried out as the blow sent yawn backward skidding on his heels over the cold hoarfrostcovered ground as yawn felt himself slide he swung off the heavy cloak the crowd gasping as he cast it over umbras great sword as it dipped down and to his foes right due to umbra favoring his uninjured left arm there was panic in umbras eyes as his right arm reached to clear the cloak from his blade struggling with his left to raise the lowered blade yawn found his footing and rushed in over umbras lowered guard lashing out again with the shields edge this time the lower edge struck umbras left hand with a loud crack and as the blade dropped yawn took a second step driving in and up off his right leg his left leading arching the whole of his weight up and and through his shield arm he clipped umbra across his chest and cheek umbra pitched wildly for a moment legs struggling to find footing arms sweeping as he fell kreiger shouted over the crowds roar first fall first blood yawn tossed the shield aside in order to offer umbra his hand pulling his pack mate up by his the two stared at each other a moment the crowd fell into hushed murmurs    umbra   beaten bleeding from a cut along his cheek    he grinned grabbed yawns sword arm by the wrist and raised it yawn laughed hard as the crowd cheered when at last umbra released his arm he held his hands up to quiet the crowd first wellfought umbra     umbra chuckled    wellfought for a bit of wheat in the wind mayhap at that the crowd roared with laughter at umbras good humor even in defeat youve fire    all of you i know you burn with it every fight every day in everything you do you burn yawn started and the crowd again quieted but fire alone is not enough kreiger knows this i know you all would give your lives for those around you as would the longfangs    as have the longfangs without hesitation or a second thought but to win he continued to survive as a pack takes more than fire it takes more than fire rage and strength youve stood with pack longfang we have survived not by being the strongest but by learning by tactics and discipline by learning to move fast to cull what we need as we go from the land to outlast our foes to outmove and outthink them the crowd again grew hushed    it was a strange feeling being listened to    now yawn knew how raskolf felt addressing a crowd the wolfs strength is the pack the pack is only strong when they work together and this what the longfang have learned i am your pack mate what i ask of you will not be pleasant or easy but let me share this knowledge with you let me show you how to fight as a pack let me make this gift to you my pack mates    and know now i will ask nothing of any of you i have not been through or will not do myself again the crowd roared yawn raise his hands one more time waiting a bit longer for the crowd to calm itself one final point     yawn smiled a bit of nerve showing even through his growing confidence yes yes i am the odd male youve heard whispers about  the one that casts you are my pack i will make no secret of it i will hide nothing from you but i am here to teach you all i can of tactics and fieldcraft not of my own personal journey the crowd murmured a bit so he continued saying kreiger i think weve stood in the cold long enough  where is it you lot hide the stew pot kreiger called back so we have yawn ill lead the way yawn called back to the crowd    no to his pack be merry smoke eat and drink for tomorrow training begins and i tell you this before the month is out you will hate me    but you will be a stronger pack the crowd again broke into merriment umbra slapping yawn twice across the shoulders  hard  as he joined him kreiger rushed in alongside yawn was that planyawn yawn looked to kreiger well i knew something like that could happen    i hoped not but it seems to have worked out well now tell me more about the rabbit stew  do you favor cheese and rabbit or rabbit and vegetables i honestly cant think of anything id rather do now than fill my stomach fill my cup fill my pipe and give you a proper send off kreigeri shiver as i sit propped up against the back of the bed in small hut its been the better part of a week most of which i barely remember as ive been in and out of awareness due to a fever even though we had a healer and his kit and a mage that could supply me with mana i still wasnt able to keep the corruption of the swamp from effecting those of us with open wounds the wounds were closed by the surgeon the best he could while we moved and i was purifying the blood regularly but we were too far in and it was too strong for me in my weakened state i am still not entirely sure how we got back to the village it took us twice as long to get home as it did to get us in and the last few hours of the journey getting out are still a blur i remember seeing the village in the distance and much like the last time i was poisoned i remember swearing as the blackness filled my vision at least this time i wasnt unconscious for days only a few hours and i didnt have any visions i awoke in the hut i am currently in being tended to by a couple of daughters and a skilled healer they told me that ylsa and rhodi of the watchwolves got myself stanrick and bryech back to the village i just nodded and whimpered as they removed the stitching the surgeon put in so they could clean the wound better now that we were safe i think i passed out again at that point this was the game we played for the better part of a week they would come in cleans the wounds i had a deep one on my side along with broken ribs and one from my hip down along the top of my left leg almost to my knee not as bad as the one in the side but it did require a lot of stitches they wouldnt let me cleanse myself as they said i needed to save my strength fever would spike on and off so i was only conscious for a few hours at a time during that week i am feeling better now fever is still there though i am spending more time awake than asleep which is a good sign it is still going to be awhile before i can travel again though with the ribs being broke i stare down at the blank piece of parchment and writing board in my lap i still havent told my clan nor my pack what happened really how could i how does one explain what a failure one is the plan was simple go in find a book and get the hell out things were going wrong by the third day i knew we had no idea where we were and the wooden supply cart had broke down and we were unable to carry all the supplies at this point getting out took precedence in my mind so i thought what i was divining for was the exit turns out gaia or someone else had other plans i never got a vision of what i was divining so i was going off instinct and faith like i normally do i can feel the tears sting my eyes as my mind relives it all i had just sent a scout up over the berm to check the other side while i scoured the area in front i was positive whatever was pinging my divination sense was nearby yet whatever i was latched on to i failed to detect it when it walked five feet behind me in someones pocket worse seer ever i heard movement so i paused and turned and looked down the road and i could feel the blood drain from my face as four mordok spotted me i turn and look to my left and right and i am the only one to be seen they charge i scream they are on top of me before i could stop them their shaman played with me slicing non vital parts enjoying to hear me scream with each one one stabbed me in the side with a spear and i remember screaming for stanrick the world starts to get fuzzy as i can feel my blood soak the cold ground beneath me i remember seeing a shield smash into the mordok above me right before the shaman could slash my throat i feel arms tugging me and i see light glint off a shiny hat as we both struggle to get to our feet and stumble out of the way fredrick got me behind the group and set me down and trusted a health potion from his own supplies into my mouth and forced me to drink it my incompetence nearly cost me my life i owe aeden a lion of arnath and a member of the bastards and fredrick of the bastards my life but no that isnt the end of it chaos broke out from there a small band of mercenaries decided to turn and kill the others everyone got separated and broke off into groups we struggled to get to a safe place from there thrand stanrick myself orrin and bryech and one of the human clerics were in one group we were forced to leave rhodi and ylsa behind as the mordok continued to swarm we ran for our lives nothing elegant or brave or heroic we flat out ran like the great wolf was chasing us we paused just long enough for me to divine a direction this time knowing i was looking for the exit we made to the broken down cart where we were swarmed again everyone fought i got slashed in the leg and in the side taking the full force of a swing to my ribs as the fight died i turned and looked behind me stanrick was on the ground my heart sank and i ran and dropped to my knees i went to go start to cast my divine magic and realized i was empty i could feel the panic setting in i couldnt keep it out of my voice i looked around desperately for a way to get the energy i needed the human cleric dropped next to me and i begged him to give me mana and he said he couldnt he did say he had enough to help pull stanrick back from the edge of death and bid me to look down i turned and looked at stanrick grasping for my hand tears stung my eyes then as i tried to hold it together in the moment here in the quiet of the hut my control falters they fall splashing on the board in my lap i remember i took his hand and begged him to not leave me alone thrand screamed to get moving and get him up he could see more mordok coming out of the edge of the clearing thrand shot arrow after arrow at them to slow them down but they kept coming orrin helped me carry stanrick bryech fought to keep them at bay but he was cut so many times by some miracle of gaia ylsa and rhodi were alive and not harmed and got a small band of people to safety including the healer and one of the mages that could transfer mana fredrick even risked his life again and went back and managed to get the healer supplies and a pack full other items rhodi and ylsa helped stanrick and bryech until we could find a place to rest and do patchwork healing i fling the board from my lap across the room in frustration i was completely useless in fact i almost got myself killed and those i care about as well i pull my knees up slowly as i can feel the stitches pull in my leg i rest my head on my knees and just sob every time i close my eyes all i see are mordok i feel the spear in my side i see stanrick on the ground i feel overwhelmed lonely and useless i dont know what it is i am suppose to be doing anymore i feel so lost i hear rustling and raise my head just enough to see a daughter stick her head in the door of the hut she is younger than me but not by much though heavier and stout of build and has wheat blonde hair and blue eyes i believe her name is rill she eyes the board on the floor then looks at me i hastily wipe my face on my sleeve she steps inside and picks up the board parchment and writing stick and gently sets it on the bed side table soulveig wants to see you she states as she looks over me i have been sent to help you i nod and pull myself together i know better then to turn this down she checks the bandages and stitches and helps me into a simple chemise and dark brown skirt my pants are trashed and my gambeson is need of repair the brown travel leathers i normally wear are too constricting with the broken ribs and stitches ive been told loose clothing until i can take a full breath again without it hurting or at least till the stitches can come out she helps lace up my brown boots and hands me my staff which i use as a walking stick since it still hurts to put all my weight on my left leg she leads me to the largest wooden long house structure in the village the outside is very plain in comparison to the clanleaders longhouse in everspring she unlatches the large oaken door and we both walk inside past two big guards i step inside the doorway and the magical energy of the room nearly sends me to my knees you wish to see me rhya i manage to state as i look across the fire at this old women who could probably toss my sorry ass into the yard with a flick of long her fingers her eyes glow with lunas energy clear as day to me as she studies me with silver eyes that never appear to blink she watched me for a while as i stand just inside the doorway i could feel her flipping through my soul like it was an old book that she was studying any attempt i made to spiritually defend myself got slapped aside with ease i finally stopped fighting and let her read what she wanted to see i looked at her with the other set of eyes i had the way she pins back her long wavy grey hair and watching her make tea from muscle memory reminded me of grandma freya who i havent thought about in years soulveigs silver eyes could pierce like a blade her strong jaw clenched in the similar way i have seen stanricks do when he is contemplating or trying to understand something and when siren does when she is pissed and is trying to control her temper soulvieg is much older than any ulven i have ever seen though yet she doesnt appear frail or sick in fact quite the opposite she had a regal demeanor that would of put anyone one in clanleader cahals court to shame i can tell she was at one time no stranger to the elder halls and court discussions her magical aura was the strongest i have ever felt though there were other visual cues from around the room that told me that there was more to the story rill stays along the edges of the room and busies herself with tasks i can tell she is listening to every word we say she finally speaks her voice is commanding like most matriarchs i know but yet there was something there i couldnt put my finger on sit child she nodded her head to a pile of cushions next to her i did as i was instructed and though it took me a moment to figure out how to maneuver around the stitching and the broken ribs she was watching me the whole time she handed me a cup of tea it will ease the pain she stated i looked at it it was a simple mixture of pineed sap spruce sprigs and lavender i sipped the steaming liquid watching her over the rim of the simple tea bowl stanrick talked with me for some time to try to convince me to see you my eyes grew big with all the preparation for the swamp and the travel i sent stanrick on we forgot to go meet with her before we left i curse under my breath rhya i i stammer she holds up a hand cutting me off hush child i dont care about excuses i shrink down into myself yet another thing to add to my list of things i screwed up on though i know why he wanted you to see me i dont know all the details of the dream you only told him part of it i sigh and nod stanrick was already trying to fix things he barely knew me at the time i didnt want to give him reason to worry or a reason to drag me here to fix it now before i went to grimward territory i had a job that had been delayed long enough though i will say that high priestess morrigan did suggest i talk to you about it as she thinks it is lingering corruption  she looks at me and tilts her head to the side for the moment and then nods probably for the best morrigan has always been wise like that so child why dont you tell me what you cant currently tell him she states as she continues to watch me as she prepares herself a bowl of tea as well i look over to rill then back at soulvieg she frowns at me she is my apprentice she will not tell anyone or she will have to deal with me very well rhya i state i look down into the bowl of tea in my lap and try to push all the current issues aside as i pull up the dream even though soulviegs pack is clanless and does not necessarily follow the same ranking systems as the clans do she is both this packs chieftain and priestess she and anjan vakrravensmark are the two strongest witches that any ulven knows of and i would be an idiot for not getting her thoughts on it if she says rill will tell no one she is my elder so therefore i believe her so i tell this ancient matriarch the same thing i told my own high priestess it starts that i am standing in a clearing and see a image of the mother gaia like when i was laying in a coma for days due to mordok poison after i had talked to raskolf in the pass she is tall and regal long black hair and the dark green robes that i know are made from the needles of the evergreen that blow gently in the breeze she turns to look at me her normally flawless pale skin is marked with black large marks that are oozing they are black like the muck in the swamp her bright blue eyes are sad and in pain she cries at me why didnt you do what i told you why didnt you do your duty and save me the plants around her wither and die and the ground under her feet turns black like the marks on her skin she slowly starts to sink like it was quicksand i reach out to help tears streaking my face but couldnt get close enough my feet are sinking into the same black tar that mother gaia is sinking in i hear a cry of pain that made my heart ache i look over my shoulder and the great wolf stood there at the edge of the black tar he strugged against arms of my brother father mother and my first mate torolf they struggle to hold him back as he howls for his mate they are trying to reason with him as he struggles to try to save her i turn back and start casting every spell i could think to get to the mother i even turn to some of the long forgotten spells nothing works i watch the mother sink into the earth and i was trapped up to my chest i hear torolf scream my name as my head slips beneath the tar i cant breath i feel hands tear my clothes and my hair as i continue to sink i hear a woman laughing though it sounds like the voice from the corruption idol in some weird way she is saying something but i cant understand what she is saying it is a language i dont know as i feel like i am about to pass out from not being able to breath i would wake up screaming and gasping for air soulveig sits there and studies me for a moment with a heavy sigh she signals rill to bring her something i know you took the idol home from here a couple of moons ago with no protection spells other then what you learned to cleanse the corruption that was foolish you are stronger then you think if nightmares are the only thing you walked away with she starts to mix a potion morrigan is right you may have some deep ingrained corruption that wont let go even with all the thorough cleansing spells i know your clan has  she studies me again then looks at her potion then adds a few more things i can tell she isnt telling me everything she knows the tightness around her mouth is telling me she wants to say something but chooses not to she is also clenching her jaw as well she takes the tea bowl from me and adds the potion to it you are going to be fighting it for a while but this should give you aid my daughters and i have seen our share of corruption from that swamp and know how to fight it better than most just remember you are not alone in this fight i didnt press for more information on what she is leaving out if it was important she would say something thank you rhya i say as i drink the contents of the tea bowl what else is on your mind child she asks as she looks at me i take a deep breath and wince a little i feel i need to apologize to you not for forgetting the appointment though i need to do that too for almost getting your nephew killed my incompetence nearly costs us our lives i work myself to my knees and bow my head to the ground in contrition she smacked me in the back of the head so hard my ears ring i sit up and rub the back of my head looking confused now knowing where siren got that trick from she raises her eyebrow at me as she glares at me like a disapproving grandmother that makes me want to shrink in on myself in shame have you ever had to divine something before she asked me yes with fritha but i helped her in her ritual it was not mine i state plainly you were how far into the swamp she stated about three days in but it took us six to get back i reply for someone who has never had to track something before with divination was surrounded by such a high level of corruption and yet still managed to see through it you may not have found what you sought but you managed to get almost everyone out alive i think you are selling yourself short i said you are stronger then you look i meant it  she is suddenly taken by a coughing fit i lean forward to help but she holds up her hand to stop me she raises her head and looks at me i notice a small trickle of blood coming from her nose soulvieg just sighs at me as rill comes over and notices and shoots me a glare go now and be with that hard headed nephew of mine he needs you more then he will admit soulveig tells me with a wavering and unsteady voice as she waves me off i frown and nod and quietly leave the long house though i can feel her eyes linger on me as i leave and wonder what it is she was unable to say to me i hobble over to the daughters of gaia healing hut and pull the curtain back it looks like a force of nature went though this hut a couple of daughters were still cleaning up the mess and mopping up some blood stanrick is tied down to a cot and fresh bandages cover his wounds on several parts of his body i frown and untie him one of the senior daughters grumbles at me if he awakens and flips out again you are cleaning it up i look at her and sigh fine they find me a bunch of cushions and i managed to sit down again dont leave me i whisper as i kiss the back of his hand i rest my head on the side of his cot and pray to gaia for guidancemy dearest larina for far too long i have not seen my beloved mate i have lost track of the days we have been defending the main bridge over the river that protects us from clan grimward it is unnerving every night we hear the songs of their warriors and we see their hunters on patrol during the day we do the best to keep our warriors in fighting shape yesterday i sparred with one of the humans from vandregon he was part of a patrol that had stopped by to warm himself by our fire the weather is turning for the worse the last of the leaves have changed and the chill in the wind cut into the cloak that you gave me i will write more after my patrol sorry beloved i meant to get back to this sooner but this war has different plans one of the younger warriors was foolish and went to the river bank for a drink the river is less than two hundred feet across here and one of the hunters on the other side of the river likes to take pot shots at us its clear that he is just toying with us because he only shot a hole in the pups water skin from the cries you would have thought he was hit in the gut we ran down only to see the hunter sink back in to the bushes we pulled the pup back and hopefully he learned his lesson i wish i had more time to write you but i am lucky if i can sleep i miss you and our son i hope he is not being too much of a handful and helped with the harvest i must rest and will write more soon it is now mid morning and about an hour ago i saw one of the war boats from the order of arnaths fist i have seen it come and go more times then i can count and i dont know if it is the same boat or if they have more then one every time they look more and more damaged but today is the worst i have ever seen it it looked like some one had tried to burn it down the once dark brown timbers are now chard black the soldiers on the boat are not afraid of the hunters on the other side of the river the first few times the hunters tried to take shots they received more arrows than they sent but it was not until the boat used its catapult that they got the hint now whenever the war boat comes up or down the river the grimward pull back just far enough that they cant hit them it is a little warmer today but the leaves will be falling soon i hope that i will be home to see you before it snows but i fear that dream is slipping away last night a fight broke out and its not the first time this subject came up what if the great wolf is angry with us what if this is not the path gaia put us on why should we kill ulvens to protect the human and syndar and like time and time before the questions lead to fighting it is getting so bad that even some of the daughters cant stop them till some one is hurt so bad they cant go on but now i find my self wondering if we are right i mean will the great wolf even know any of our names or will he be so mad that he wont care what our names are i keep losing sleep over these thoughts and i dont know what to do bodil tells me that as warriors even if the war displeases the great wolf we should not fear it because we are loyal to our clans and that loyalty will please him her words only help so much she misses you too and sends her love and also dreams of the day we can all be together again sadly this will have to be my last letter for a while we dont have much paper here and i want to send this with the next hawk may gaia be with you beloved your loving mate thaerstanrick longfang it was about midday when stanrick found himself near the banks of the river he had been wandering for over a day now hunting not for food or mordok but for something else he knew that he was not far from the village and luckily what he was hunting for did not allow for him to travel far a rock really im looking for a rock how in the name of gaia am i supposed to find a rock that is most like selena instead of getting supplies ready for his journey in to the darkness of the dirge swamp he went hunting for a rock he had turned over thousands of rocks if not more looking for the right one he found brown rocks gray rocks black rocks and white rocks he picked up big rocks small rocks round rocks and sharp rocks none of those rocks even closely resembled selena ulven mating was a strange matter but not as strange as courting males would do the oddest things for females once courting began courting would start with a male attempting to gain favor with the female this in itself could be strange some males would sing some would dance and others would fight selena however chose stanrick because of his little brothers stupidity yawn saw stanrick leave selenas tent the morning after the fair in new aldoria if he would have talked to his older brother about it and not let it fester like a splinter in his mind then he would have known that stanrick and selena did nothing but discuss her dreams the whole fight could have been avoided if yawn had not attacked him stanrick would have been trying to impress selena on his own the elder brother had made a drawing of selena by firelight as he kept watch while he was escorting her from the graytides land to the long fang outpost he had planed to use the picture to impress her he felt an attraction to her at the outpost months before and it only grew over time finally he did give her the drawing after she pulled the glass from the back of his head it was that night under the full moon that the courting began stanrick had done strange things before he had climbed a tree to get an egg out of a birds nest he once captured a live rabbit by hand yet here he was in the middle of the woods looking for a rock this was by far the strangest thing he had done he stopped and sat down ok gaia i am listening what can i do to find this he listened to the wind the birds and the water he looked up at a cedar tree the sunshine was coming through the branches and a beam was shining in to the stream he got up and walked over to look the roots of the tree were twisted in knots over rocks and dirt growing into the water he looked into the stream where the sun light shown and he saw it a small smooth stone it was blue like selenas eyes it sat there in the middle of the rushing water reaching for the stone stanrick fell into the stream thrashing around and trying to keep his head above water ulven were not made to swim he started to panic not thinking straight this is going to be it he thought i am going to die in this damned river the great wolf would laugh at him and eat him for this death all because of a female it made him smile and he stopped his struggle the water flowed over his legs and he sat up oh great wolf damn it it was only about a foot deep and cold as winter he got up and turned to look for the rock which was still sitting in the stream he reached down and picked it up it was smooth and had different shades of blue a smile crossed the veterans face for he knew he had found the stone he got out of the river and sat on its shores looking at the stone turning it around in his hand content with his find the walk back to the village was short but gave him time to reflect on the crazy thing he was about to do he was going to go deep into the swamp he knew it was crazy and he had begged his friends not to go he even saw to it that yawn and siren were sent elsewhere so they would not follow he could not do that for selena for she had not listened to him this would not be the first time he went off deep in a place that did not want him but for her he was glad to go if even to just to keep her safe they would get out just fine he saw the gate to the village and selena sitting and waiting he smiled and looked at the gift in his hand but as he looked at the stone a thought crossed his mind why is this stone like selenaselena stargazer selena pauses at one of the bridges that connects the two territories together she is quietly surprised that it still standing she turns and looks behind her back into nightriver territory then up the river with a sigh its only taken her a few days to get here from new aldoria quicker then she was expecting she hope her letters made it as she shifts her packs on her back she takes a deep breath time to go to work she mumbles as she starts across the bridge as selena crosses the bridge she knows that she is leaving behind the safety of her clan nightriver escorts knowing that crossing with her would be suicide the handful of ulven disappear back into the woods she looks down noticing the long dried and old blood spatters it is obvious that the bridge has been a place of numerous battles recently since the civil war broke out as she nears the end of the bridge a handful of ulven on the clan grimward side of the bridge move forward to greet her they make their presence known but stay far enough back so that any nightriver archers cannot launch an arrow at them these warriors are dirty gruff and battle weary several of them are adorned with scratches and dents on their armor as well as dried blood and fresh bandages a warrior with intense predator eyes a shaved head and a large braided beard steps forward either you have a death wish you are crazy or you have a purpose for crossing this bridge alone state your business says the bearded warrior selena sighs most think i am crazy for coming back this way but either way i am selena stargazer truth seeker for clan spiritclaw i am looking to meet with khulgar graytide the bearded warrior looks over the ulven female in front of him and sizes her up for a moment we have been expecting you come with us he says as he turns and begins to walk away as the clan grimward warriors leave selena walks beside them they make no attempts to converse with her and are not even remotely friendly they do not give selena the impression that they will hurt her though and for that she is grateful the small band escorting selena passes by several groups of heavily armed and armored ulven these groups are stationed close enough to the border between the two clans that they can react and join in on a battle or reinforce a line from what she can see most of the ulven on both sides are dug in and appear to be waiting selena feels that both sides will not yield to the other peacefully and this civil war could last for a very long time after a long and grueling walk that takes most of the day selena and her escorts reach a small village the village is alive with movement as warriors and villagers move all around stacks of weapons and armor are being tended to feverishly by a small team of blacksmiths a triage unit has been established where a number of ulven villagers and several daughters of gaia are tending to wounded ulven in a farmers field nearby lay hundreds of small tents as warriors tend to cooking fires and do combat practice and drill battle lines near them the entire village has been transformed into a support station and supply line for the clan grimward army as selena is taking in all the sights she realizes she is being watched she snaps out of her observation to realize that before her stands khulgar graytide she hadnt noticed that her escorts have taken her directly to the command tent at the heart of the village and that she had reached her destination standing in his padded gambeson large predator furs adorn his shoulders and his blood red eyes and intense gaze give khulgar a very dangerous and cunning quality selena knows this man has faults and is capable of reason but the months of war have been turned him into a hard veteran warrior he was not wearing his helm at this time allowing him to converse more easily while in the village selena i am pleased to see you again come sit and we can discuss i received your letter detailing your arrival you have questions for me no doubt given your role and title says khulgar as he turns and takes a seat near the outside of his command tent it good to see you again as well rhya selena smiles and replies she is careful to use the honorific title as she can see people watching her out of the corner of her eye as she takes the seat offered she slowly reaches into one of her packs knowing she is being watched by more than just khulgar at the moment and pulls out a bottle carefully wrapped in cloth and offers it to khulgar as is customary a gift for you for letting me stay in your territory she says courteously as he takes the offered bottle she sighs and crosses her arms under her chest yeah i seem to have more questions then i do answers currently and everyone has a different story to how something happened it makes my job difficult the biggest one that is on my mind currently is the failed peace summit the ending everyone can agree on that it went bad quickly no one is disputing that the question i have is was it planned that way from the start and if so by whom or did they do something that triggered the slaughter well you want to dive right into your questions now dont you i have a feeling you had a long road and plenty of time to think about them before this meeting says khulgar as he pours himself a tankard of water from his leather water skin the summit at the great hall of clan grimward was what a year and a half ago it seems like it was so long ago so much has changed since then said the ulven as he was lost in thought for a moment before the summit violence broke out in clan grimward territory a pack of humans moved into grimward lands and settled there they were warned to leave and ignored the warning when pack graytide went again to remove them violence broke out and many of the villagers were killed it was unfortunate that it happened but tell me of a clan other than the pathetic nightrivers that would allow such a trespass on their lands tell me selena stargazer would your clan be so neutral if it was their land that the outsiders moved in and took from you spoke khulgar as emotion began to fill his voice and his blood red eyes took on a fierce look he continued before giving selena time to respond clanleader haygreth grimward wished to hold a summit and discuss peace with the watchwolves the voices of nightriver and the leaders of the outsiders there was a lot of talk leading up to the summit of what to do i will tell you honestly what i told haygreth i told him that we should go to war i told him that we should cast out these vermin and push the outsiders back into the sea that we need to be true ulven and defend our lands and gaia from these intruders haygreth values my opinion highly but he is wise he called for a summit as a last chance to talk and discuss the terms in which the outsiders were to be dealt with said khulgar as he took a good long drink of his water tankard selena shifted as she considers his words during the summit i admit that i was worked up i called out raskolfs honor and said things that i should not have said the entire great hall was in a heated argument and members of both sides were losing composure food and plates were being thrown oaths of vengeance spoken in anger even our high priestess was involved and attempted to tell raskolf and the others of the dire portents that her wisdom had seen when news of the dead walking on mardrun reached the hall haygreth asked raskolf if he knew of this he blatantly admitted to it he kept this secret from his own people roared khulgar as he slams the tankard down on the table caught up in the emotion of reliving that scene haygreth had heard enough raskolf had thrown in his lot with clan nightriver whose leader i personally witnessed had bowed down to appease the outsiders at the so called political dinner from earlier and haygreth saw the honor and pride of our people slipping the infectious lies being told by the outsiders were poisoning the minds of some of our leaders and he would hear no more khulgar seemed to calm down a bit and lean back into his chair haygreth drew first blood he declared his intention for war and nearly cleaved a fat outsider priest in two after the man offended him he then ordered me to remove the heads of the other outsiders and send them back to their leaders in sacks a bloody battle broke out as clan grimward warriors and those traitorous ulven following raskolf drew steel on each other we killed each other with ferocity unmatched as ulven killed ulven for the first time in our history does my answer satisfy your question selena stargazer says khulgar grimly waiting for her response she is quiet and reserved and just watches his every move as he relays his story the only reactions she shows is she does jump a little when he slams his tankard down when he finishes she sighs one starts with the uncomfortable questions first so one can move on to lighter topics later and try to mend the wounds from the heavier topics yes rhya your story does satisfy the other half of what i was looking for she shrugs and says to answer your earlier question if it was our land if they are just coming in and taking it without respecting the territory of another then probably not we would remove them at blade point as well it comes down to if they are being respectful to the people that actually care for the land once they learn whose it is i dont expect the outsider to know whose territory they are on until someone goes to greet them if they are respectful and we can determine their worth like do they make new products to trade do they grow a food source unique what new building techniques do they know they dont get to use the land for free they have to contribute like everyone else in the end though its not me who makes that call it would be the clanleader of clan spiritclaw you did ask them to leave and they didnt so they brought it on themselves i suppose  she is quiet for a view moments as she contemplates where to go from there i suppose the next story i wish to hear about was about an honor duel with freya rev anda she shakes her head i spent a week at the outpost and when i told them of my desire to come back this way they one looked at me like i was touched in the head and when they couldnt persuade me otherwise they told me to have you tell me this story at the mention of the honor duel khulgar shifts in his seat he contemplates for a moment reliving that memory as well he is obviously hesitant in answering i am not sure how this topic is relevant to this discussion you came here asking about the war we are currently in did you not khulgar snaps back at selena realizing that his reply was a bit harsh khulgar sighs and then continues the honor duel was two years ago i was traveling with ekaj graytide and a few other hunters we had some supplies that we had promised to deliver to the onsallas village while we were there the mordok were more active than normal and were attacking the longfangs a number of outsiders had traveled to the outpost as well after helping them drive back some mordok we rested in the outpost i then discovered that freya rev anda was there the bitch was responsible for the death of my brother one of pack graytides best warriors and next in line to become chieftan so i challenged her to an honor duel i lost next question replies khulgar in a somber tone she raises and eye brow at getting snapped at though she remains calm and shrugs i also heard as part of that story is that you supposedly cheated during that fight and drew a dagger and tried to kill her even though apparently that wasnt the terms of the honor duel i dont necessary understand what this story has to do with anything either they just said i should ask i dont get to decide what is relevant my job is just to collect the information khulgar sat and sized up selena for a moment he waited just long enough for the pause to be uncomfortable before continuing during the duel i do admit that things got out of hand i am shamed to admit that i indeed did draw a knife but i did not intend to kill her perhaps you should ask your source about how the outsiders disrespected us both by interfering they stepped in and tried to stop the honorable duel a fight almost broke out between ekaj and several of them and even kragen bloodmoon tried to interfere i lost the duel i admitted defeat it should have ended there but kragen continued and pushed it further he even threatened violence against me and drove us out of the outpost i swore that he would regret his actions that day he brought dishonor to his clan be allowing outsiders to interfere said khulgar as he stood and moved to an armor stand nearby hanging from the stand was his oiled chainail and breastplate and where is kragen now the mighty warleader of the clan hides behind branthurs skirts and calls for claims of peace yet allows blasphemous acts to be committed on our soil kragens time has come to an end along with branthurs for the true ulven of this continent will not stand idly by and allow gaia to be savaged in such a way true ulven warriors do not sit idly by and allow such transgressions said khulgar with venom in his tone as he began to don his armor several warriors moved to the tent they made an obvious move to ignore selena as they addressed their leader chieftan one of our scouts has reported that the stormjarl emissary is here he wants to talk directly to you said the smaller of the two warriors has there been any word on the clanleaders daughter we heard reports that her ship disappeared as it moved down the coast replies khulgar as he finishes sliding the chainmail onto his torso no chieftan she is still missing i checked in with the other packs some of our war bands moving through the area and even the scouts from units stationed along the stormjarl border nobody has reported in seeing her or has any knowledge of her disappearance no warrior loyal to grimward would dare interfere with or attack a daughter of gaia sent on behalf of clan stormjarl replies the warrior as khulgar continues to equip himself in his armor he turns back to selena tell me selena when in the history of our people have any of our emissaries disappeared when traveling by boat clan stormjarl are master sailors and we have had no ill weather recently since mordok do not sail ships what do you think happened to her since she was reported to be heading towards nightriver territory i also need to know how much longer you plan on questioning me i have things to do none to my knowledge none have ever disappeared that hadnt fallen victim to storms selena frowns unable to keep the concern from her face that a fellow daughter is missing she slides her hand into a small cloth bag at her side stones rattle as she pulls one and studies it for a moment nothing good that is for certain but which group is responsible is yet to be seen i can think of two off the top of my head that may be responsible one would attack a ship the other has been causing problem in this area in the past but i was unaware they could attack ships on open water she absently rubs the blue stone between her thumb and finger last question who is the witch in charge here i have a ritual that needs to be passed on to her anything else i can ask others about khulgar tightens the belt around his mail armor but keeps his gaze fixed on selena the witch that you should see is yohla grimward she oversees the daughters that are supporting the clans warriors in this area she is very skilled and studied directly beneath our high priestess she is at the village northwest of here about a half a days journey whatever it is that you need her for it must be important says khulgar as he puts his breastplate to his chest and holds it there the warrior who had spoken to him earlier moves forward and begins to buckle him into the last of his armor you traveled all this way through a civil war to inquire about the past questioning my honor in the process whether you intended to or not and then simply ask me where to find the nearest witch i am not sure if you playing a game selena but i would recommend that you not we are at war clan grimward has had emissaries meet with numerous clans to discuss their involvement in this war clan stormjarl is ready to join our cause clan whiteoak already has the watchwolves are being ground to dust we continue to bleed them and take their lands what is the decision of clan spiritclaw she leans forward and rests her arms on her knees and she keeps her gaze fixed as well her voice is hard but tired you think i am playing games fine then ill just speak plainly then i have been back and forth more in the last six moons then most ulven travel in a year ive been hearing stories that your some sort of damn nightmare and will kill your cousins at the slightest provocation i seem be one of the few people left who doesnt want to believe that i have seen you fight remember i know better i traveled this way not because i am looking to disrespect you in fact quite the opposite i traveled all this way in this gaia forsaken war because i wanted your side because i do respect you and didnt want to believe all the stories i was being told  she rifles in her bag and pulls out two sets of papers and set them on the table next to her i am looking for a witch because witches are the next highest ranking than a daughter if i thought i had the rank to walk up to a priestess or high priestess i would do that but i know i dont while you are so busy worrying about who is taking a shit on your land the mordok are getting stronger warriors are spread so thin or so concentrated on the lines that mordok are running rampant i spent the better part of the night with people i didnt really trust helping decipher this ritual from the old runic language so fritha stormjarl and i could cast a ritual in time feel free to read it if you like i translated it into common and made copies of the runic as well for your clan this goes beyond the civil war this is beyond who is pissed at whom fight the corruption however you can is one of the tenants both pack stargazer and clan spiritclaw uphold and while it is my duty to try and figure out the damned war as a truthseeker my duty to the pack and to gaia as a daughter is just as important maybe more so protecting gaia has been and will always be our duty  while you worry about where your next victory is clan spirit claw has a square full of refugees from both side of the war we will give hospitality to them until they can go home they are family no matter how distant i wont lie this will probably put a strain on our winter food stores but we will not abandon them or let them go hungry though i am guess we arent the only ones going to be struggling this winter either with most of the able bodied males in the lines farms are short handed production isnt as good as it should be with war ravaging some of the more prime hunting grounds game is harder to come by for the hunters she takes a moment to take a deep breath to calm herself you are so worried about who is on what side when you forget that we are all supposed to be on the same side the hawks are still flying a decision hasnt been reached yet khulgar listens to selenas words he was calm and obviously taking in what she said although his exterior shows a calm and collective leader selena knew that her words bit deep and rattled him how could any leader of the ulven denounce what she had said as truth these are indeed dark times for our people that is why clan grimward has made a stand and a line has been drawn if we sit idly by our entire race could be at risk what kind of future do we hand over to our children and their children are we the generation of ulven that will admit that we allowed such transgressions against our people our culture and to gaia herself to go unnoticed and unchecked would you not defend your family if an intruder entered your hearth and home what is worse selena peace and the slow rotting decay of our people or war because we refused to bear our throats to the change when we die do you think the great wolf will hear our names if we were to allow such things to pass khulgar says surprisingly without emotion as he walks over to his armor stand he picks up his rhunic decorated metal helm and stares into the eyes of it the dents and scratches from previous battles glisten in the light selena sighs and looks at the ground what are we teaching the children when we draw steel against our own with out the call of a honor duel what are we showing the children by killing entire packs families who werent even at the political dinner or signed the treaty who are just trying to work the land and survive but happen to be on the wrong side of the river she leans down and picks up a handful of dirt and lets it fall between her fingers i would defend my home if someone broke in but stay my hand in killing them until i could find out if they meant me harm or they broke in because they where just cold and hungry maybe i am just soft like that though selena brushes her hand on her pants and looks back at khulgar you are forgetting the great law of the woods adapt or die stagnation and refusal to adapt to change causes just as much death as invasion and sudden change the outsiders brought bad habits with them that is truth most of them have changed to adapt our ways not all but most but would you kill and entire pack because one member offended you or would you challenge that one person to a honor duel and be done with it traditions we are forgetting them you have every right under gaia to chase them even kill them if they are on your land and you have asked them to leave and they have not respect the territory of another the law is pretty simple though lets be clear here though the outsiders did not cause this civil war we did they are just the excuse being used to continue the fight we have to be the ones that end it one way or another this fighting is not something i want to pass on to our children what would gaia and the great wolf think of us if we left this mess for our children to clean up says selena my warriors will escort you to the nearest village meet with our ranking witch and if needed i will approve of your counsel to any priestess that you need i will not allow your work to be impeded and whatever food and supplies you need will be granted to you take whatever time you need and a boat can also be arranged to hasten your travel when you are done here if you wish although you would have to travel west to the coast in order to board khulgar replies as he turns the helmet over and slides it onto his head his sudden shift in topic shows selena that he is done with this conversation selena picks up the papers and places them back in her bag at the mention of an escort to the village thank you rhya i think i will take the long way home though she says as she looks up at the trees they are almost to full color i think i need to make one more stop at onsallas for pineed sap before it stops flowing for the winter she looks up and frowns as their gazes meet and the meaning isnt lost on her what your clan is doing with the refuges is amicable selena but in this war of our people neutrality is not an option says khulgar as he locks an intense gaze on selena obviously to let the meaning of his words to sink in after a few moments khulgar turns and walks away in his full battle dress and armor his strides confident as he walks toward his gathered warriors selena sighs tiredly and hikes her stuff up onto her shoulder and heads in the opposite direction towards the villageyawns dreams had been playing tricks on him or    or yawn hoped they were one could only forego sleep so long sooner or later    sooner or later but always    but always with certainty oblivion would catch you would drag you down would wraps its arms around you soft and sweet and welcoming before dashing you against the inside of your own skull yawn had to sleep    had to had to keep up appearances    all eyes were on him any mistake    and the rare talent hed shown would vanish all that work all the blood pain and effort gone in a breath of anger yawn tapped his pipe clear    at last relenting to his bed roll how quick the nights embrace came yawn yawn needed to work he needed to work fast he was hunted but first    first the task    then his fingers stitched something supple and wet he did it without the aid of daylight    just a flickering candle his fingers knew the trick of it his fingers damp and slick but working the wet turned gummy now and then and with each stitch and pull to tighten the thread    stout stuff whatever it was the needle very fine bringing pain he didnt stir save for his task as he felt his fingers dance a quick precise practiced stitch    and at last the seam finished his nimble fingers flicked the needle end over end looping the thread over itself the needle through pulling the stitch taught tying it off with a hard pull his left hand snapped the thread    why was he stitching with only his left hand he worked the needle into a spot on his tunic    why wasnt he using his right hand to hold the work steady why didnt the work need to be steady when had he learned to mend with a single hand why his hand took up the needle again a voice came from the dark trembling  not with weakness but with roiling hate at once    at once his heart broke the pieces swelling and filling his chest why keep fighting everything youve ever loved is dead the voice questions him yawns hand begins tying off the threads end    tough wet    sinew it was sinew and he was starting a new line  the light came into better focus his eyes finally taking in the faint glimmers of light why why not end it all you cant win yawn knew what he was binding there in the pale light he was stitching the skin of his right arm back together    not his skin not his arm his now his arms were the stuff of nightmares with patchwork skin stitched together in a mad pattern    the fingers on his left    disjointed freakish things stitched at each knuckle bony but impossibly quick clever had he been experimenting binding the dead to himself he felt this dream of himself blend with who he was now the reasons    the loss the grief sticking in his throat they killed siren the voice came flat empty of hate or sadness hollow his rage had always burned cool but this was something different they killed stannrick they burned onsallas to the ground they killed rill his fingers did the dance with needle and thread    as sensation returned to his right arm he saw    no felt    no something between sight and feeling a knowledge a certainty that the fingers of that one were whole how many times had he done this by the lines and patches on his body more times than he could count    grief has driven you mad yawn as it did you when my brother died again    flat hollow a third voiced joined werent you the one to speak of pyres and bodies yawn you wanted to protect to defend to save this is vengeance yawn    it will kill you at last the alien body that he knew as his but not at all his looked to those addressing him ysla the first voice    magrat the second    ysla had grown fit magrat looked as ever herself save for her eyes  hollow haunted eyes    yawn was grateful not to see himself    great wolf only knew what this version of himself did to rest of his body  yes yes it is vengeance    bbut but you will tell my story to the great wolf     he spoke stuttering and hesitating at first but gaining strength with each word he may yet know my name    i may yet join my sisters my brothers and my mother    for i know my father has no place in the great wolfs longhouse he rose took up his shield and mace and a familiar singleedged blade    untouched by time    its edge still true and unbroken no signs of use or any clues to what drove him there isnt time to argue    go    make my death mean something     all this    all this to slake your taste for blood yawn ysla called his dream body faced the door and without turning replied i just cant die knowing hes still drawing breath i will show them what it is to suffer the trap door slammed behind him he hardly noticed over the blood pounding in his ears he had a task    gaia forgive me for what i do the first was through the door ax raised yawns hand lashed out a quick precise thrust to the throat the steel an extension of this alien body the familiar weight and balance highlighting the horror of this vision    in came the second and third    again yawns arm acted of its own accord and his enemies pressed in through the door    so here you die yawn called a voice a voice that filled yawn with hate oh i will    but will there be any left to cry out your name to the great wolf the room burst with laughter hes gone mad finally snapped when started stitching himself back together i knew he was gone but the last thread tethering him has snapped came that hateful voice finishing with a low chuckle oh yes    yes you can certainly kill me yawn felt the mana burning in his hand as he let his shield drop away but tell me    can you kill them the three fallen rose    the    no his tools of vengeance    hed had given all he would give all he would burn the greytide the grimward and the white oak from the world screams and war cries filled the room each fallen warrior rose again another tool guided by his hand    yawn smiled as his foe found himself in the snare hed meant for yawn trapped him instead    a gift that affirmed his vengeance once you used my own mace against my friend yawn started as he strode over blade in hand mace in its loop    no other words but his own rang out now only screams and moans the gnashing of teeth filled the room only the voices of the dead and dying besides himself now   now i will scour you and your packs and your clans from the face of gaia but you  you will be there for all of it you will see all of it you will be my first great work these he gestured to the shambling figures once ulven  now his monsters to command these are simple mindless    hungry dead he leaned in placing the blade under his foes throat you will be my first attempt at raising something worse and i pray you will be awake in that shell i use to witness every last thing i have it do the blade sunk in and the eyes opened black eyes    knowing eyes    yawn woke up in a cold sweat heart pounding he fumbled for the water skin drinking deeply he glanced about    good he hadnt disturbed the camps watch his hand slipped into his pack pulled his pipe out and filled it hands were numb he paused as he fished out the fire stick whispered a silent prayer to gaia and lit it as he drew deeply on his battered cherrywood pipe at last his heart slowed its pounding he drew again and again    blowing great billowing cloud of maykar burly smoke nix whispered in his ear none it is true yawn    worry not i would never let you give yourself over to that he answered quietly thank you nix he didnt see it but he knew nix was smiling at times like this he felt a small weight on his shoulder    nixs favorite perch her spirit bringing him comfort now maybe if you listened to me and emptied your skull before bed youd have fewer of these dreams yawn think of that when next you feel awkward meditating among ulven he replied in a soft whisper why would i say that of my father nix brushed her whiskers against his ear you know naught of him but what youve heard yawn perhaps those you love protect you from the truth you may find it but once you know yawn  as you learned you could cast  there is no way to go back to not know    finish you pipe and do see about doing something useful knowing you you wont be falling asleep again this night tomorrow hed trudge closer to his new home his new packthe fire burned low in the great hall of the watchwolves of luna the assemblage had been talking for a long time and had shut out the servants so no one had tended the fire recently we estimate that there are perhaps eighty grimward soldiers in the wolfs hackles said knorr to the council they have entrenched themselves in such a manner that the terrain favors them against any troops approaching from the east in other words they have cut us off from the watchwolves of sol the nightrivers and the fenrir said bergthorr the lunar chieftain our allies will not likely be able to break through said knorr even if they had superior numbers the grimwards are in an excellent position to defend from that direction our only hope is to open the pass from this side said raskolf we cannot spare the warriors to do that said bergthorr the graytides are massing on our southern border we will just have to wait it out while relief comes around the mountains the long way we will be dead by then said raskolf you are not in any position to argue such ambassador said knorr you already overstepped your bounds with that debacle in grimward territory you are no longer a military commander consider yourself lucky that you were even allowed to participate in this meeting if you dont want my input then why invite me i have more experience with this sort of thing than anyone else here you have made poor decisions in the past said bergthorr your record is far from flawless i myself might be a grandfather by now were it not for your incompetence as a war pack leader by the way that is a very nice shirt dont make me compliment it twice more to make it mine weregild debtor raskolf gritted his teeth i would never be so arrogant as to claim to be infallible he said i made that mistake once before as you so politely pointed out but i learned from my mistakes i learn from all of my mistakes and trust me i have made mistakes that you dont even know about tell me about it disgraced one said knorr one of the reasons we are in such a situation is because you went and got our chief warpack leader killed in that disastrous peace summit of yours last spring imglyf would be sitting right there in your chair hold your tongue in the name of gaia stop yelled lucia this is my first time being allowed into such a meeting and i pray to the mother of us all that this is not how my leadership does business thank you young witch said the priestess you are correct this is not how the watchwolves of luna do business now how badly do the graytides and grimwards massing to the south outnumber us there are at least twice as many of them said knorr not only that but khulgar graytide and lycon graytide are leading them and their personal warpacks are among the assembled these are not mere clan militia of grimward these are warriors they are well equipped and well trained what do we have to work with asked the priestess one understrength warpack with an inexperienced leader and our militia of turnip farmers and blacksmiths dont sell our people short said raskolf many of those farmers and blacksmiths are veterans of our war with the mordok they may not be well equipped and many of them may no longer be in their prime but they will fight hard to defend their homes do not underestimate our warpack either those warriors have faced the grimwards before and their leader was there when imglyf fell what about the independent warpacks asked lucia have any of them answered our call for help the bloodfangs said they were coming said knorr their leader was once a watchwolf of sol we have had no contact with them however they were coming from the east they could be somewhere in the great wolfs hackles already if that is the case said raskolf then it is even more important that we open that pass it is our lifeline to the solar camp the nightrivers and possibly one of the most elite warpacks on mardrun with what troops said bergthorr we dont have anyone to send we need our warpack here to protect our capitol our people and our great hall ill do it said raskolf pardon the cliche laughed knorr but you and what army i will take my personal bodyguard of longfangs as well as the novices that my brother has been training they are good i have watched them practice raskolf said chieftain bergthorr two things for you first may i remind you that you are not allowed to lead military actions anymore ever second nice shirt then i will go and trade with our enemies in the mountains trade asked lucia yes i will take my personal bodyguard which my brother will surely augment with his students and we will go and trade steel with the intruders this council will not allow such nonsense shouted bergthorr do not think that you can speak for all of us chieftain shouted the priestess raskolfs plan does not use any of the troops that you had planned on using in the defense of our land on matters of trade or commerce you have just about as much authority as he does regarding defense his longfangs are his bodyguards and they have to follow him wherever he goes if he goes into the mountains it is their duty to follow him and what of rhodis students said knorr are we really expected to send our sons and daughters on a suicide mission one of the final stages of their training is to fight alongside an actual warpack said raskolf the opportunity to fight alongside the legendary longfangs is not one that comes along every day besides i have a theory and what would that be if the graytides and grimwards have massed two warpacks in the area to our south i find it hard to believe that they would also place elite warriors in the mountains to hold a pass that would leave their lands farther south and east open to the nightrivers and the humans of the order there are eighty grimwards sitting up in that snowy mountain pass right now far from home and feeling sorry for themselves they are not warriors they are militia a few minutes ago raskolf you told us not to underestimate militia its different when they are defending their homes these grimwards are not there is more to war than numbers chieftain the chieftain gritted his teeth you are getting way too good at bending the rules to suit your desires raskolf vakr no matter what you say to the contrary that is proof enough to me that you are no longer a warrior but a politician stop looking for glory you claim to have learned so much from your mistakes and yet here you are ready to march a tiny contingent of troops against overwhelming odds to relive your past it is selfish and unbefitting the only thing i care about is the ulven people and my clan snarled raskolf that pass is the key to our survival as a people and i am willing to risk my own life to secure it that is not selfish at all that is enough said the priestess it does not matter whether or not raskolf has the approval of this council he is not asking permission of us he is simply telling us what he is going to do i may not be a tactician myself nor have i ever walked the path of the warrior but i know a thing or two about the hearts of warriors and i can tell you that within his chest beats one he does this not for glory but because he believes it to be right what would you have him do chieftain if not to go to the pass asked lucia i would have him guard this hall he is a good fighter you mean you would have him protect you she snapped and you call him selfish how dare you you insolent pup this is the first time that you have been invited to sit with us in council do not make it your last my apprentice makes a good point chieftain and whether or not she attends these gatherings is not your decision to make it is mine see to the defense of your people it is your job since you have already dismissed raskolfs counsel on the matter you obviously do not need his help we should release him from this meeting very well raskolf you are dismissed but before you go weregild debtor i would like to compliment you a third time on your very fine shirt raskolf said nothing he turned his back to the assembled elders unfastened his belt and pulled off the fine green tunic that had been gifted to him by the prince of new aldoria folding the shirt nicely he set it down on his chair as the flickering torchlight danced across the branded runes of shame upon his chest and back thank you raskolf vakr said the chieftain you better leave now before i compliment your pants as well if you did that then you would be the one who felt ashamed of himself chieftain good luck sir with your battle here i hope that the great wolfs ears ring with your name the chieftain snarled in return but raskolf was already leaving the hall you could have let him leave with his dignity chieftain said the priestess dont you see it said the chieftain he is a careless gloryseeker not a warrior he hasnt changed at all over the years and he hasnt learned anything he just wants to redeem himself in the eyes of the great wolf by dying heroically but it doesnt work like that you cant try to be a hero it has to just happen that man is no warrior and he is certainly no hero my son was a warrior and my son was a hero and my son is dead my son is dead because of raskolf vakr and now you fools have just condoned that idiot to take another pack into a hopeless fight to die their blood will be on your hands and the hands of raskolf vakr but not mine you are blinded by your emotions chieftain said the priestess i think you are blinded by your ambition priestess growled the chieftain i beg your pardon raskolfs mate is the clan high priestess after all enough shouted lucia standing so quickly that she knocked her chair over backwards that is enough look at yourselves what in gaias name are you thinking this is no time for infighting our enemies could be crossing the border as we speak my whole life i always looked up to you people i always trusted that you were wise and that you knew best and that you would take care of me and my family i was but a child but i knew these things to be true well today i see for the first time just how foolish and naive i have been you are not wise you do not know best you are just children yourselves bergthorr bared his fangs but then averted his eyes and clenched his fists he said nothing chieftain bergthorr said lucia you lamented earlier tonight how you lost your son and had no grandchildren but i think that you may have forgotten your position you are the lunar chieftain of the watchwolves the people outside of this hall all look to you as a father or a grandfather they trust you to be wise they trust you to be fair they trust you to be understanding and right now they trust you to protect them and organize their defense that means that you need to listen to your advisors not chase them out of here with their clothes half on what you did to raskolf was juvenile and you should be ashamed of yourself young man i mean old man chief  outside the great hall of the watchwolves of luna the human warrior thanatos stood talking to stanrick so what do they do in there during these meetings he asked how should i know grunted stanrick youre a guard surely youve been in there during this sort of thing before no he hesitated not really come on friend tell me are they doing some kind of dark rituals are there animals involved of course not is there blood are they reading entrails why are you being so persistent i cant help myself said thanatos the irony is killing me explain human see that right there you just did it you invite us up here for this great cultural breakthrough and make a big production out of allowing nonulven into your hall for the first time but then afterwards things go right back to the way they were before look here pup things are not the way the were before nor will they ever be you are within the walls of this stockade are you not and are our leaders not in that hall at this very moment strategerating how we are going to survive the war that we got ourselves in all because we stood up for you people in the first place how dare you show such disrespect we are a proud people and our leaders are wise charismatic and selfless what is going on in that building right now is a sacred and beautiful thing suddenly one of the doors to the great hall burst open and raskolf trudged out into the snow of early spring the barechested ambassador screamed flung his balledup cloak into a snow bank and kicked one of the pillars so hard that he dislodged a sheet of snow from the roof overhang i knew it said thanatos to stanrick theyre gambling in there  lucia began hastily gathering up her things her mind was racing she couldnt believe she had just said that and her anger and righteousness was suddenly replaced with terror she just wanted to run away she scurried towards the door and reached for the handle you are right said bergthorr dont go what asked lucia chief said knorr lucia had never thought in a million years that she would live to see the day where she snapped at an elder let alone spoke to one in such a chiding manner but her own actions werent nearly as shocking to her as the fact that her chieftain had just admitted that that he was wrong and she was right lucia felt dizzy as if the world was being turned on its side she wasnt entirely off target either but of course it wasnt actually the world so much as her world you are right he said again i let my emotions get the better of me my eyes are blinded by my hatred for the one who took my son from me now sit back down witch sit back down we have our work to do here lucia set her chair back up fixed her hair and then took her seat she was trying not to let anyone see that she was shivering with anxiety and kept her hands out of sight beneath the table now in the event that raskolfs er trade caravan fails their mission said bergthorr we could be in for a long siege knorr have someone find out how much food we have in our larders and in the larders of every outlying village of more than twodozen people we will need to consolidate it here and plan the evacuation of the infirm and the children every ablebodied adult of 12 years or older who is not part of the militia already will begin training tomorrow on how to fight in a unit send word to every village as the militia moves south to our border villages they can pick up anyone who owns their own weapons and armor those who dont should head north to train here i will make it so said knorr lucia said bergthorr have you selected a warder yet no chieftain you have fought the graytides before i want you to head south with the militia to supervise the triage and care of the wounded and to offer spiritual guidance to the troops it is dangerous to go alone however before rhodis students leave for the great wolfs hackles i want you to go and select a warder from amongst the class in that case chieftain i have already made my decision i choose drifa we fought the graytides together at the wayward inn and i trust her with my life very well said the priestess go to her then and tell her when this meeting adjourns do you have a totem necklace to present her with lucia coinen the daughter of the most successful merchant in the history of the ulven people smiled she had more jewelry lying around then she could keep track of i do  the village looked different empty everyone had either fallen back to the next village down the road by gills farm to train with the militia or had been evacuated to the chieftains stockade farther north the five guards were the only ones present here now their job was to serve as lookouts for the rest of the militia who were over at the farmstead the guards ranged in age and variety from a fat whitebearded old man with barely a tooth in his head to a skinny boy not old enough to shave and having just gotten his fangs gazing up into gray skies the old man squinted in the bitter wind a raven cawed in the distance the old man arose from his seat on the snowy earth shrugged off his blanket and began to crack his joints what is it grandfather asked the boy it is a sign the old man grunted what is the bird it is just a bird no said the old man reaching for his dented old helmet and shuddering at the cold metal as he set it upon his head it is a sign i know that bird there will soon be a wolf on the road wolf road exclaimed the boy the eyes and ears son the eyes and ears they come to warn us that our enemies are coming what do we do stammered the boy fumbling with his armor as he followed his grandfather outside of the wall the old man didnt answer at first as the two walked out onto the road in front of the village they were joined by the other three guards the old man smiled sadly as he gazed out upon the snowy southern road your shield boy growled one of the other guards who worked as a baker when he wasnt part of the town watch huh oh said the boy running back inside the walls to retrieve it that grandson of yours would forget his own head grumbled the baker the old man didnt say anything he just slowly raised an arm and pointed to where the clearing ended and the road disappeared into the darkness of the woods there was a wolf on the road with a raven perched upon a stump next to it the world was silent for a few moments a grim omen said one of the guards what is panted the boy returning with his shield the wolf and the raven were already gone you missed it grumbled the baker fastening the chin strap on his helmet he was not meant to see it said the old man it means that he is not to share in it what are you talking about grandfather you must leave now son he said you must run as fast as you can to gills farm and alert the militia there that the enemy is coming no he shouted i will stay and fight the eyes and the ears can alert the others they dont need me and i wont leave you the four of us have seen an omen boy said one of the guards drawing smoke off of his pipe for the last time and then dumping out the bowl you missed it that happened for a reason it isnt your choice now go warn the militia and join up with them grumbled the baker and dont sulk you might still get a chance to die later with them here boy take my pipe maybe smoking will help your beard come in assuming you live to see the end of the day whats going on cried the boy why wont you tell me we have seen a wolf on the road son said the old man now run swiftly to the farmstead knowing full well that the real great wolf will be less than a village away from you and closing the boys eyes widened do not mourn us son said the old man wrapping his cold arthritic hands with dry leather strips it is only death the great wolf already knows our names you on the other hand said the baker better run along before you get eaten i killed two mordok last summer he protested no you helped kill one that had been ganged up on by you and your little friends snickered the other guard and the other one was almost dead already and you put it out of its misery neither of those count now go join up with the rest of the militia so you can at least get the experience of fighting in a shield wall well we should all go come on no son said the old man the eyes and ears are upon us and we will be judged besides we couldnt keep up with you go now and do your duty i know that you will earn great glory and honor in the future for if you were not meant to then why would you have missed the omen when the rest of us saw it it is a good day to die said the guard tossing his tobacco pouch to the boy to go with the pipe hed already given him but not your day to die i will be brave grandfather said the boy and i will prove my warriors heart by not crying even if i miss you you make me proud grandson said the old man the great wolfs ears will surely ring with your name someday they surely ring with all of yours this day said the boy if i live to have children i will make sure that they too know all of your names it has been an honor said the baker saluting the boy as he turned to walk away the boy hesitated and tried to keep himself from looking back it is alright said the old man you do not need to be ashamed to say it i love you too son i love you grandfather the noise of weapons being beaten in rhythm upon shields drifted up the road the boy ran as fast as his legs could carry him to warn the others of the attack the graytides clustered at the edge of the woodline khulgar was puzzled by the apparently deserted village and the four poorly armed and barely armored men who had come out to challenge his mighty war pack he was afraid that it was a trap but after the humiliating defeat at ulslog his warriors were too worked up and frenzied for him to hold them back he didnt order a charge but it happened so he worked his way to the front of the pack on the road an old man stood defiantly his spear set to receive the charge as the screaming horde closed on him and his companions time seemed to slow down and the black armored warrior with the red eyes seemed to morph into the shadowy form of a great black wolf the fight was over in exactly as much time as it took the warriors to run over and trample the four men on the road the boy ran as fast as he could he was already clear of the northern boundary the cold air burned his chest he was ashamed of himself hed promised his grandfather that he wouldnt cry  there were fifteen of them in total on the trading caravan into the great wolfs hackles the party was comprised of seven watchwolves seven longfangs and the human named thanatos raskolf scouted the grimward encampment from the higher ground of a ridge there were twenty of them otama and azra looked on as well fifteen versus twenty is not good odds especially when the defender is the one with the numbers but there was more to it than simple math raskolf could tell that many of the grimwards were archers that meant two things first that they were likely not warriors but men who hunted for a living secondly they were lightly armored and carried no shields raskolf confirmed this by glancing around the camp indeed there were only a handful of shields lying about the element of surprise would be everything in this battle if raskolf could get his troops in close enough the archers would be helpless against his armored sword and board fighters the grimwards in this camp were disorganized and unprofessional they did not even post sentries otama said raskolf we are going to charge straight down the one trail that they are actually guarding otama didnt say anything but she raised an eyebrow we will charge straight in just those of us with long weapons or large shields about half of us in total we will create a shield wall right there where they have actually prepared to defend behind otama azra grinned she had played this game before the defenders will think that everything is going as they have planned and drilled for they will focus all their attention on trying to overwhelm us with numbers and focused archery we have the shields and armor to endure that long enough for azra and a handful of others to charge down the ridge and flank them from within their own camp we will get rid of the archers first said azra they will go down quickly once we close with them that will even the odds and put us behind their melee fighters otama shot a concerned glance at raskolf and you ambassador will be in the back coordinating this raskolf didnt acknowledge her statement he just tossed his cloak back over his right shoulder and headed back down to the waiting warriors and novices minutes later he was charging madly down the trail straight towards the enemy camp raskolf get back shouted otama how are we supposed to protect you if you are in the front run faster he panted up ahead he could clearly see archers scrambling to pick up their gear and nock arrows shield wall he yelled now lock up but keep moving this wasnt the plan snarled otama overlapping her shield over raskolf as arrows began peppering the formation thats ok he grunted thrusting his spear into the belly of a grimward militiaman no plan ever survives contact anyway just watch as the warriors cracked shields together and traded steel otama saw azra and her skirmishers sweep down the ridge and into the helpless archers cutting them down before many of them even had a chance to draw their swords or make any effort to defend themselves see grunted raskolf their plan of defending this pass just totally fell apart otama watched as an arrow sank deeply into raskolfs right arm causing him to lose his grip on his spear his opponent took advantage of this and rushed in close raskolf managed to reach across his body to protect his exposed side with his shield but the angle was awkward coming from the opposite side and the weakness of the stance left him vulnerable he successfully turned aside the blow but lost control of his shield in the process the low upward strike causing it to fly up and strike himself in the mouth with its edge raskolf lost his balance and tumbled backwards into the snow his opponent also took a fall from over extending and nearly landed on him otama and harlok moved in quickly to finish off the ambassadors grimward enemy azras skirmishers cut down the last archer and charged into the rear of the grimward line the fight was soon over the steel trading caravan had defeated an enemy that outnumbered them they had suffered only a few minor injuries themselves including raskolfs arm which was immediately tended to by the daughter of gaia who had accompanied them raskolf smiled at his frustrated bodyguards though his grin was a little less smug and even more lopsided now that his right fang had been lost somewhere in the snow i heard a horn raskolf said siren they may have alerted the next camp when they sounded it we need to keep moving then he said catch your breath and get bandaged up we need to maintain our momentum they will likely be better prepared at the next camp  as the grimwards marched into the next watchwolf village they found themselves confronted by an organized defensive formation of shields and spears the militia had placed themselves in a narrow part of the road to make flanking them difficult and a large patch of ice lie in front of them very clever muttered khulgar who was vividly remembering the battle at ulslog they have done everything they can to stack the odds the stockade opens up between two buildings and we are on a slight incline it matters not grunted lycon we outnumber them more than two to one and few of them even have proper armor drifa blackfrost pushed her way to the front of the watchwolf formation she was adorned with black warpaint and carried a claymore over her shoulder not long ago she would have been terrified to so much as look khulgar graytide in the eye but after the events at the wayward inn a cold resolve had overtaken her she was no longer drifa of winterclaw the refugee who looked out for number one and begged for scraps from another pack she was a watchwolf now and these were her people leave these lands at once khulgar graytide you are trespassing trespassing laughed lycon why that would suggest that these were someone elses lands they are not these lands are ours and have been ever since we set foot upon them all we are doing now is clearing them out go home lycon graytide shouted a wiry old watchwolf with a bushy white beard before you slip and break your hip you are too old to be on the warpath i certainly hope that the great wolf knows your name you geezer replied lycon for the meat upon your bones is surely long since spoiled go home lycon said the skinny old man whose name was nezzer there are fishing nets to be mended oh nevermind you cant even do that you old cripple the graybearded lycon bellowed with laughter and warriors on both sides cracked smiles at the two grouchy old men i know you said khulgar pointing his mace at drifa last time i saw you you were running terrified into a swamp while your friends bravely fell in combat against my warriors khulgar laughed this socalled leader of yours is naught but a coward i used to be a coward graytide but you forgot one thing about what happened at the inn you forgot what happened when you cornered me and lucia i fought you khulgar thats right said khulgar scratching his chin you did try to fight me id have easily killed you without so much as a scratch if it werent for that traitor rogar looks like youve gone and gotten yourself cornered again woman sneered lycon its different now she said im not a cornered animal this time there is an open road behind me and you certainly know that its where you are trying to go is it not im a wolf standing up to fight alongside my pack i am a watchwolf of luna now and i am protecting my land and my people how touching said khulgar whether you are a cornered rat or a female bird protecting its nest makes no difference to me laughed lycon khulgar took a few steps out onto the ice you blasphemers dont have to die senselessly today said khulgar to the watchwolves we give you a chance to earn redemption in the eyes of the great black wolf who judges you even now join us in our war against the outsiders and help us to purify gaias lands of this corruption and filth from across the ocean before our mother shares the same fate as the invaders homeland you dare to call us blasphemers shouted drifa you who wear ears and fingers as trophies you who pull the fangs from other ulven for the sake of your jewelery since when is it up to you to decide which tenets of our faith are to be observed and which are to be ignored i saw my entire pack perish because they committed the same sins that you are committing you were right about one thing though khulgar i used to be a coward it was how i survived but the tables have turned now here i stand resolute and unafraid while you and your packs cower in the shadows clan grimward does not cower oh but you do said lucia you are afraid all of you especially the graytides you are so afraid of the colonists from across the sea that you have placed your fear of them above your fear of our own gods that is why you adorn yourselves with such blasphemous trinkets it is why you have resorted to treachery and lies to manipulate your own people how far will you take this war against your own kind graytide said nezzer will the violence ever end or will you just keep killing until there is no one left for you to breed with but the mordok you revere with your sick trophies i will light your pyre myself this night screamed lycon graytide charging across the ice and burying his axe into the skinny old mans kite shield knocking him clear back into the formation and nearly dislocating nezzers shield arm as he ripped the blade free before khulgar could regain control of his warriors the pack followed lycon and surged forward onto the slippery ice steel rang out and wood knocked together as the grimwards crashed shieldsfirst into the watchwolf formation only to lose their footing and stumble back into the tangle of bodies the icy ground hindered their movement and made it nearly impossible to fight watchwolf spears flashed out from the defensive formation and even the ones that only caught contact with grimward shields pushed the attackers back and caused warriors to stumble and fall on the ice time and time again drifas massive claymore cleaved into the grimward shields splintering the wood knocking troops down and even breaking shield arms her countless hours working in rhodis smithy since her adoption had given her a startling upper body strength that allowed her to wield the largest greatweapon on the field with unusual ease she truly was a different person than she had been when khulgar last faced her at the wayward inn and he was a little unsettled by her ferocity as he watched her pummel his warriors into the frozen earth he kept waiting for her to tire but she showed no sign of slowing down despite the scale of her melee weapon nearly matching her own height the rest of the watchwolf formation however wasnt matching her endurance nor her ferocity the defense held for a while but the grimwards had the numbers to press their advance onto better footing and once they did the watchwolf formation began to falter casualties mounted on either side the more experienced warriors of the grimward and graytide warpacks finding their momentum as the watchwolf line buckled and smaller three to four person skirmishes broke out lucia moved down the road as casualties needing her attention began to mount and drifa was forced to fall back to protect her ward on the front line lycon and khulgar cut a swathe through the poorly equipped militia making their way towards lucia and drifa khulgar was sure that he could take drifa for though strong of arm and stout of heart she lacked experience and skill what he really wanted to do was to challenge her to a duel he fixed his gaze on her as he pulled his mace clear of a crushed watchwolf skull time seemed to slow down as he closed with her their eyes met drifa adjusted her grip and took up a better stance placing herself between khulgar and lucia before khulgar could challenge her though lycon graytide charged in from the side he was about to bring his axe down upon drifa but she spun out of his reach and brought her claymore around the long way with all the momentum and power of her movement behind a single blow it connected crushing his ribs through his armor and cutting deeply into his side khulgar watched in rage as lycon crashed to the ground showering lucia with blood and spittle he wasted no time watchwolves were already swarming lycons fallen form stabbing him and trying to drag him away khulgar and ekaj rushed in to protect him ekaj distracted the enemy while khulgar helped his friend to his feet and put pressure upon his wounds as they hurried back toward their lines khulgar heard brave ekaj fall in combat behind them but they couldnt stop drifa wasnt sure exactly what happened she had been forced to turn her back on khulgar to keep lycon from getting to lucia as she had pulled her claymore free of lycon graytide she realized that she had been stabbed in the back something hit her in the head and she started having trouble seeing there was red everywhere she was on the ground suddenly and everything was foggy and wet something stabbed her again and again the next thing she knew she was being dragged towards the grimward lines lucia was there too marching at swordpoint the battle raged on in the meantime though the watchwolf militia had seriously faltered the sudden loss of the grimward leadership had happened at almost exactly the same time that a small contingent of men from vandregon and watchwolf reinforcements led by a warrior named artai had run in from the next village and bolstered the lines they had even taken a graytide as prisoner the fighting slowly devolved from an organized attack and defense into a cluster of chaotic skirmishes within the village going from building to building fence to fence old nezzer had just finished off a fighter much younger than himself who was trying to flank the building containing the casualties when he noticed some of the grimwards were retreating nezzer watched as the witch and her warder drifa were dragged away something primal flickered within the base of the old mans skull and despite better judgment he ran after them alone without saying anything to anyone else  back at the mountain pass the trading caravan was locked in brutal combat against the grimward militia it was the third battle they had fought in less than an hour raskolf had never been so shot full of arrows in his life and his shield was starting to look like perhaps the leather covering it was genuine porcupine hide not only was he tired but it was getting increasingly difficult to move his legs were stiff and he was pretty sure that he had pulled something in his spear arm from a combination of all the overhand stabbing and the arrow he took there in the first fight today he was out of shape and out of practice but he tried really hard to conceal his misery his current opponent certainly wasnt helping things the two had been going round and round for way too long at first raskolf was impressed that his opponent was holding his own against him now he was starting to get concerned that maybe it was the other way around raskolf faced a hardy youth of perhaps fifteen years the boy was ridiculously fast and moved with a spryness and confidence that impressed the old veteran raskolfs spear gave him the advantage of reach but the weapon was more suited to fighting in a group than in one on one combat typically in such a situation raskolf would have dropped his spear and drawn his sword in case his opponent got in close under his spear but the boy was just too fast and raskolf didnt have time to change weapons he was forced instead to settle for a sturdy under arm position which helped keep his opponent back but made offense difficult because he was limited to stabbing straight into his opponents shielded zone fortunately for raskolf the kid never rushed in close or capitalized when he parried the spear thrusts raskolf guessed that his opponent was a wild talent and probably had little formal training if any it was only a matter of time though before he figured it out raskolf could see the wheels turning in his head as two more warriors moved in to assist raskolf and flank the boy the young grimward nimbly dodged their attacks rolling and somersaulting just out of their reach over and over again the kid was fighting with instinct and raw talent in a different time and place raskolf would have tried to recruit him for the tundra wolves in the here and now though he was an enemy otama locked blades with the young fighter while one of the watchwolf novices knocked him off balance by burying a claymore into his shield the boys eyes bulged in the sockets as raskolfs spear punched through his unarmored abdomen and sent him crashing down into the snow like a boar held down by hunting hounds blood spewed from the boys mouth and as he impacted the frozen earth raskolf looked down at the fallen grimward youth he barely looked old enough to shave tears welled up in the boys eyes and he began gasping for air like a fish on land what is your name warrior asked raskolf solembum choked the poor boy the great wolfs ears ring with your name solumbum he said you fought well we will howl your glorious death when we light your pyre tonight raskolf nodded to his fellow watchwolf and the boys suffering was ended with one sweep of a claymore thats seven for me today said the novice to one of his fellows that doesnt count said the other that was an assist the young novices started bragging to each other and calculating how many they had killed so far that day gaia forgive us raskolf muttered to himself as he saluted his fallen foe raskolf was about to say something to the novices but he stopped himself and instead turned his back to them and walked away solembum had been the last to fall the steel trading caravan was battered and exhausted raskolf began checking on his comrades they didnt have much fight left in them harlock longfang was in bad shape but was refusing healing indicating that he wanted others to be healed first there was no time to consolidate though because another pack of grimwards emerged from the woods on the other side of the pond there were about twenty of them against raskolfs remaining thirteen orders ambassador said stanrick hold here replied raskolf if they try to cross the pond they will fall through the thin ice if they come around the long way they have to go through deep snow and then cross an open field catch your breath and eat some snow we are going to make them charge us yawn thanatos taunt those grimwards make them angry what when said yawn looking up from the wound he was bandaging now why because they are too far away said stanrick as it dawned on him would you want to fight someone after running that far through knee high snow wait said thanatos why am i doing this because you are very good at being annoying grumbled stanrick it is because you are human thanatos said raskolf they hate humans right said thanatos the two moved a little ways out into the open field so that they could be clearly seen and heard by the grimwards pardon me yelled thanatos thats right you you fornicators of matriarchs you are all just in time to watch us ravage and desecrate these little girls that you sent against us in combat if you would care to surrender now we could really use some slaves to help us dig a pit we really ought to dig a latrine for this filth yawn began dancing and making lewd gestures with coaxing from stanrick the steel traders began laughing and cheering as loudly as they could my friend the human infidel is right bellowed yawn say do all grimwards have weak bladders or is your bloodline so thin that it just smells like urine i say shouted thanatos you female curs have dreadful posture how many generations removed from your mordok ancestry are you seconds later the grimwards were charging through knee deep snow here they come shouted one of the watchwolf novices picking up his shield and sword raskolf raised an eyebrow and shook his head a minute later the grimwards were charging through knee deep snow should we form up ambassador asked the novice a minute after that the grimwards were still charging through knee deep snow ok said raskolf if you have a bow string it and move to the front the fastest of the grimwards were just breaking into the open field wheezing panting and struggling with cramping and stiffening legs they were widely scattered now with some of their slower troops still quite far away as the charge faltered and they limped into the open field the trading caravan filled them with arrows by the time any of the grimwards had actually managed to close with the watchwolves and longfangs the numbers were much more even and any advantage that the grimward had as fresh troops had been lost it was a brutal melee both sides were agonizingly exhausted to the point where they had forgotten their skills and training and combatants simply made slow and heavy chops at each other until someone died one by one the wheezing and panting grimwards fell to the members of the steel trading caravan it had been no easy victory for them however and not without cost two of the watchwolf novices were dead and harlok longfang had been mortally wounded after entering into a berserking rage and had smashed a hole through the enemy line everyone was bloody almost beyond recognition and raskolf couldnt walk he had taken arrows to both legs and been stabbed repeatedly in the back and chest by someone hed mistook for dead otama scowled at him as she tended to his wounds azra he croaked realizing that his throat was completely dry and his voice gone raskolf tried to wet his throat by eating some snow it helped a little but it also hurt his broken fang like crazy he finally managed to get her attention ambassador she said harlok is dying i know friend that is why i called to you take these to him raskolf handed her two healing potions that he had been saving for an emergency azra wasted no time in running back to the unconscious warrior he was barely breathing the longfangs managed to carefully pour the potions down harloks throat some color returned to his face and his breathing seemed more consistent but he did not wake up i fear it may be too little too late said the novice with the healing basket yawn nodded solemnly as he helped hold pressure on harloks wounds siren and stanrick carefully worked the casualtys armor off of him to expose the injuries as blood oozed out and turned the white snow a striking color of red siren removed harloks left gauntlet to reveal a mangled and crushed hand with a broken forearm the bone protruding through the skin in two places i know some first aid and some basic healing said the novice but i fear that he has internal injuries beyond mundane ability hopefully said yawn those potions will be enough raskolf sat there panting from the immense exhaustion of fighting for so long he looked in front of him at the wounded and the dead and the immense splatters of blood and gore that dotted the white field in front of him warriors collapses to rest and tried to tend to numerous stabs and cuts and broken limbs a longfang warrior with a spear rolled over a dying grimward and stuck him through the gut and pinned him to the ground without any hesitation or remorse dear gaia what have we done said raskolf  nezzer slowed from a jog to a hunters stalk his quarry didnt move quickly the grimwards were dragging drifa and lycon nezzer couldnt believe the amount of blood that drifa was leaving behind before long the grimwards reached the outskirts of the first fallen watchwolf village where they had set up a hasty triage and camp nezzer knew that town well he had a close friend who lived there based on the message from the mans grandson earlier though nezzer assumed that his friend had died honorably in combat that morning nezzer counted the guards at the back gate there were two women one was an archer and the other was armed with a battle axe then he circled around and checked the livestock chute there was someone on the other side but he couldnt make out how they were armed as he observed the grimward daughter of gaia tended to lycon graytides wounds khulgar was there too nezzer watched in silence through the gap he would have to wait drifa continued bleeding out into the snowy earth 100 feet in front of him but nezzer could do nothing to help her he had lost sight of lucia and the grimwards who had captured her lycon graytides wounds were tended to stitched and he was administered one of the precious few healing potions that their witch had in her healing basket khulgar made some hasty repairs to their armor in the mean time once lycon was back on his feet the two gathered their things and prepared to escort the witchs apprentice to the front line khulgar paused and stared at drifa and the reddening snow around her prone form see something you like old friend laughed lycon elbowing khulgar she has good hips on her and is very strong me thinks shed throw some powerful children from beneath a tangle of dirty blood matted hair drifa bared her fangs at the two graytides no lycon said khulgar no but look how spirited she is shed be fun to break he sneered gyrating his hips and squinting his eyes id be willing to help you with that the chieftain shot an annoyed glance at the big onearmed veteran i was right gasped drifa about you you arent children of the great wolf nor do you uphold his honorable virtues you are just mongrel dogs silence wench said lycon or what youll kill me go ahead do it grant me a warriors death it is the least you can do a shout came up from the front gate it was one of the guards look she said to the novice patrolling the perimeter there is a wolf on the road the witch looked alarmed made a holy symbol across her chest with her hands and grabbed her apprentice to avert her eyes before she could see for herself khulgar didnt look instead he stared into the watering eyes of drifa blackfrost and clenched his fists the great black wolf is watching us khulgar graytide choked drifa as blood dribbled from her lips onto the snowy earth tilting her head back and brushing her hair aside drifa exposed her throat to him khulgar ground his teeth and snarled tend to her wounds witch said the graytide chieftain he then turned his back to her and walked down the road drifa laughed like a madwoman she laughed so hard that she vomited do not let any further harm come to her khulgar ordered the two women guarding the gate the wolf is gone muttered one of them you missed it are you even listening to me he growled yes chieftain just keep her alive dont let anyone kill her of course chieftain well said lycon as the two graytides walked away escorting their daughter of gaia to the next village if you dont want her then maybe shell be mine those poor kids would be built like cave bears grumbled khulgar lycon bellowed with laughter and would have slapped his friend on the back but khulgar was on the wrong side of him so he could not the three ulven walked down the road towards the front line the forest was eerie and silent of any noises of gaia not a single bird or beast was to be heard or seen as they got closer to the next village the sounds of steel ringing and warriors shouting carried clearly in the crisp winter air khulgar was giving serious thought to his next troop movements and as to who was going to replace brave ekaj as a lieutenant when his train of thought was derailed by the big warrior at his side ive given it some serious thought khulgar said lycon you need to move on your mate has been dead a long time exactly as long as your sense of humor in fact what why are we talking about this now loneliness does not befit you khulgar continued lycon it makes you grouchy and unpleasant we are on a battle field right now im just saying that you could use the attentions of a woman a mead in one hand a soft breast in the other and a round butt sitting upon your lap the young daughter of gaia shrank into the recesses of her cloak and shrugged her shoulders she fell back a little to put some distance between herself and the big onearmed graytide khulgar bared his fangs shut your mouth lycon he said i am merely saying old friend said lycon what no one else would dare tell you your mate has been dead a long time khulgar ground his teeth and clenched his fists you know what else has been dead a long time he said the days when you were of sufficient station to talk to me so casually whats that supposed to mean khulgar growled the onearmed graytide time and again i have looked to you for wisdom and all i get is foolishness and selfishness dont be ridiculous shouted lycon im just trying to look out for you old friend no you arent youre embarrassed that that amateur swordswoman got the best of you and almost killed you now youre looking for an excuse to show her a different kind of swordplay you are just trying to manipulate me i cannot believe that you would even suggest such a thing you ungrateful bastard i cannot afford another one of your failures like at uslog take the daughter to the front line i must find black owl you are dismissed khulgar snarled lycon i taught you everything you know i most certainly hope not lycon growled khulgar turning to walk away i made you dammit bellowed lycon i made you you wouldnt be where you are today if it werent for me khulgar stopped dead in his tracks and his shoulders tenses in primal rage he suddenly spun around to face lycon once more with a glare that would cut lesser men down where they stood and where am i lycon he shouted where am i i stand here in ulven territory and yet in enemy territory do you not understand do you not see this is wrong lycon why do you revel in it so why do you love such grim business lycon stared at his old friend until he could no longer bear his gaze then he averted his eyes and clenched his fist the young grimward daughter of gaia tried to hide within the hood of her cloak khulgar said lycon this is the ultimate test of a warrior it is the greatest opportunity in all of history to gain glory and the favor of the great wolf we face our corrupted peers we face other warriors not stinking cannibalistic animals but real ulven warriors then what does that make this lycon snarled khulgar the final battle the end times the glorious and bloody climax to some ridiculous holy conflict blasphemer shouted lycon you know damn well that this war is all about preventing the end times is it really said khulgar or do we instead hasten it as we tilt the ears of the great wolf with violence against our own people have we forgotten the other half of our spirituality what of mother gaia what damage do we do in our conquest what consequences must we live with in the future lycon shook his head he said nothing nor did he meet khulgars gaze you shouted khulgar daughter of gaia the poor girl gasped in terror as khulgar grabbed her by the shoulders tell me he said tell me that this is gaias will tell me that we are justified please whimpered the frightened daughter of gaia please dont tell me he shouted tell me that it is gaias will tell me that i am her instrument the girls eyes were huge with fear tell me he shouted shaking her violently yes screamed the girl you do her work it is her will please let me go coward roared khulgar shoving her into the snow so easily manipulated and this is our spiritual leadership he turned to face lycon even if it is the will of the gods lycon he said it is dark work at least pretend that it bothers you khulgar turned and trudged off the trail and into the wet and heavy snow and so thats it said lycon and now you turn your back to me consider yourself relieved of your duties as my advisor said khulgar you ungrateful wretch shouted lycon i treat you like family and you betray my trust and my loyalty traitors are the worst kinds of enemy lycon khulgar said over his shoulder because they were once brothers lycon looked like he was going to say something but instead he just stood there in silence for at least a minute the poor daughter of gaia sobbed uncontrollably within the hood of her cloak and fell to her knees in the snow she felt as though she might throw up from the shadow of a pine bough corvo blackwing regarded the entire scene undetected as lycon stormed off dragging the daughter of gaia by the wrist corvo redirected his gaze to the shrinking silhouette of khulgar graytide the corners of the blackwings mouth slowly curled upwards into a grin not easily replicated by one possessed of a sane mind and his eyes laughed in silence like those of a rabid wolf  after the witch had finished tending to drifa she retired to one of the buildings in the little village leaving the prisoner with the two female guards i dont think shes going to make it said the first guard why not said the second because the chieftain seemed interested her replied the first guard and i cant have anyone competing for his attention ive worked too hard to get this close to him when he picks a new mate it will be me or no one at all oh giggled the second guard i see what you mean now that i look at her she doesnt look too good does she maybe the witch missed a wound yes said the first guard drawing her dagger this one right here the guard pulled up on the edge of drifas kidney belt and slipped the dagger underneath the armor and into the watchwolfs flesh the roving guard outside the wall heard the others talking and turned to peek through the fence that was the opportunity that old white bearded nezzer had been waiting for the young graytide died quietly and his body fell softly into the deep snow nezzer wasted no time he wasnt much of a runner these days but he strode confidently in through the open back gate the female guards had their backs to him and were taunting the hemorrhaging watchwolf as he crunched through the snow they mistook him for the young warrior hed just killed and paid no attention the first guard glanced over her shoulder to say something to the roving guard but it was too late she was met with the white visage of a redeyed wolf upon a black kite shield and a flashing blade across her face and throat ended her life almost instantly the other guard panicked and stumbled back over drifas bleeding form the old man hacked gracelessly at the grimward with all the vigor he could muster until she lie mangled pumping fresh lifeblood from numerous wounds and crying in the snow nezzer was about to finish her when an arrow whizzed in and stuck in his shield three more arrows struck the shield and he peeked out over the top at the shooter she was a skinny young girl no older than fourteen or fifteen she had made the amateur mistake of an archer who has only hunted and never fought before she had run in close to the old man as she fired trying to get a better shot she was within charging distance now she was also clearly out of arrows and carried no sword a panicked look entered her eyes and the color drained from her face as she began hyperventilating and stumbling backwards tripping over a rock she landed on her back and made a muffled whimper as the wind was knocked out of her nezzer stomped up to her raised his blade and made eye contact with her she had the same look in her eye that a prey animal gets when it has been caught she was in shock all was silent for a few seconds and then she began crying hysterically nezzer knew that he needed to kill her he needed to kill all of them he couldnt leave survivors as he studied the girl he realized that she was but a shortfanged child his rage left him as he was suddenly bombarded with thoughts of his own grandchildren being forced to fight for their lives you he said pointing a wavering blade in her face you do not belong here you are a foolish child please she whimpered i was just trying to save my friends i know said the old watchwolf that is why you are going to honor my victory by letting me save drifa blackfrost i have defeated four of you by myself and i have earned it i am going to take her and leave now i have shown you mercy if you shoot me in the back the great wolf will know of such treachery the terrified girl sobbed and nodded her head the old watchwolf threw drifas arm over his shoulder and grabbed a hold of her kidney belt with his other hand she could barely support any of her own weight almost all of it was leaning on nezzers old arthritic frame he had barely made it to the gate before he started to seriously doubt whether or not he could actually do this hed been a strong young lad once but that was long ago it didnt help that the snow was so deep nezzer gritted his teeth clenched his eyes and tried his best to control his breathing but before long he was snorting like a beast of burden he tried to adjust his hold on drifa but it didnt help he was still a long way from the watchwolf line he was starting to get his second wind and pick up a rhythm when suddenly an arrow thwacked into the kite shield that was strapped to his back nezzer stumbled forward he meant to set drifa down but momentum got the best of them and the two tumbled facefirst into the snow another arrow whizzed just over head and the deranged cackling of black owl echoed through the wood nezzer untangled himself from drifa and fumbled to unstrap his shield holding it in front of him he drew his sword and began trudging and stumbling through the snow as arrow after arrow struck his shield as he closed with his adversary poor old nezzers legs were burning and spasming so bad that he could barely bend them and his shield felt ten times heavier than normal there was nothing else to do though except push forward he was less than twenty paces away when black owl threw down his bow and went for his sword nezzer doubted he could defeat this warrior as fatigued and slow as he was but his shield did give him an advantage that was when nezzers silent prayer was answered black owls blade stuck when he tried to draw it nezzer saw the opening and lunged forward with everything he had black owls blade broke free of its scabbard a second too late and the old watchwolf was already upon him nezzer knocked him to the ground pinned him down with his shield and began madly hacking at the fallen warriors legs with his sword as if he were chopping wood in a log splitting competition he only stopped when his arm was spasming so bad he could lift it no more and he was breathing in ragged gasps khulgar graytide was looking for black owl and he had just found him the crazed warrior was cackling and shrieking maniacally as he lay bleeding to death in the snow beneath the hunched and shuddering form of an elderly member of the watchwolf militia the old watchwolf heard khulgar coming up behind him and spun to face him on all fours splattered with blood and foaming at the mouth like a predator upon a kill khulgar was slightly taken aback by the unusual scene but remained calm as he drew his mace from its belt ring nezzer knew he had no chance in a fight against khulgar graytide but he no longer cared get back khulgar he snarled i have defeated five of your warriors by myself today just so that i could carry drifa blackfrost back to our lines i am spent now but i have earned this small victory im done fighting if you carry in your heart any sense of honor or respect you will stand aside and let me carry drifa home khulgar narrowed his eyes and studied the hunched and shuddering old ulven as he stumbled to his feet nezzer sheathed his sword slung his shield and walked straight towards the graytide chieftain as if he wasnt even there khulgar took a small step to the side to let him pass he glanced over at the mangled and bloody form of black owl who began laughing even more hysterically as the graytide chieftain met his gaze what is your name elder warrior he asked nezzer my name is nezzer he replied and i am but an old fisherman not a warrior khulgar crouched down to apply tourniquets to what was left of black owls legs they stammered drifa who was barely conscious they lied to you khulgar your own people they lied to you hush drifa whispered old nezzer who had his back to khulgar and couldnt believe that he was still alive im sorry whispered drifa i i think i just died you worked so hard thank you nezzer almost fell over as drifa lost consciousness and all her weight suddenly shifted nezzer said khulgar i have an important message you must deliver it to raskolf vakr very well panted nezzer hefting drifa back onto his shoulder what is your message merciful graytide khulgar told nezzer what his message was  the watchwolves couldnt believe their eyes when they saw old nezzer coming back with drifa blackfrost on his shoulders he turned her over to the care of the watchwolf daughter of gaia and checked in with the militia captain artai who was arranging a prisoner exchange to trade ekaj for lucia the watchwolf witch nezzer handed his arrow filled kite shield to a youthful member of the militia as well as his helmet only stopping to get a drink of water he began falling back toward the nearest settlement that would have messenger hawks he had to get khulgars message to raskolf as he cleared the outskirts of the village and made his way out onto the road he heard a noise off to the side it was a girl she was sobbing nezzer stopped and turned to face her it was the grimward he had spared back in the other village she had an arrow knocked and at full draw coward was the last thing nezzer ever saidbergsveinn was ecstatic his mentor was finally taking him with her on a mission alvr was gruff thorny fought like a angry cat and sang like a boar hed mate her if he could manage it it was an important mission too he could tell alvr brushed it off saying it was just a diplomatic mission but the stormjarl and the longfang had long been allies it probably had something to do with the war alvr was no diplomat neither were any of the guards coming with they were going to the longfangs far flung outpost it was about as far from home as he could manage without landing in a mordok nest and that suited him just fine his young blood boiled at home his mother deftly keeping him out of harms way and therefore out of funs way but she couldnt thwart alvrs willno one could he thought gleefully and alvr needed a partner on the long trek they were even going to get ponies alvr had decided that with the war and all they would need extra supplies she didnt want to hunt much in what could be unfriendly territory so she requisitioned two ponies bergsveinn hadnt been around the stocky furry creatures much but he had always admired them from afar hed heard that the outsiders had bigger ones ones big enough to ride he hoped one day to see it but he couldnt imagine ever actually keeping one let alone riding it one of the ponies was named crackers she was a young mare beige colored and sweet the other was named scramp an old man in pony years dark brown and grumpy bergsveinn loved their little ears their wispy manes their scraggy fur their feathers on their hooves and their soft noses this was going to be amazing by the time they had left grimward territory and were almost to the longfang outpost bergsveinn did not love ponies they were smelly they ate too much they were bad tempered and would step on your foot if they thought you werent looking they wouldnt listen to him and would sometimes just decide theyd have enough of this walking nonsense and refuse to move at least thats what scramp did crackers was pliable enough but scramp refused to do anything that bergsveinn wanted the stupid pony made him look foolish in front of alvr and would never be forgiven for it she had actually laughed at him laughed he tugged on the lead pleaded and yelled but scramp refused to move in a fit of rage bergsveinn snapped up a stick and whipped the ponys flank the animal squealed in outrage lashing out with its hooves and bolting bergsveinn sat on the ground struggling to breath and watched the animal flee into the woods accompanied by the derisive howls of his companions good riddance he thought victoriously alvr stared at him in horror find that animal she snarled but he whined find it now they followed the trail of destruction that scramps passage had made finding bits and pieces from the ponys pack strewn across the ground you had better hope that the package is in one piece or so help me i will cut you and feed you alive to the mordok alvr promised and he was not so sure she was joking they found scramp chewing on grass and looking mighty smug bergsveinn wanted to hit the infuriating beast alvr sprang at scramp and before he could escape she had his lead in hand she desperately dug through the torn packs on his back nononononono shit shit shit she wailed what what is it whats wrong he asked bewildered we are dead we are so dead she will kill us and skin us and feed us to crows alvr cried in despair its gone the claimant bar is gonei hunker down under an outcropping of rock and my crude lean too and pull out a new journal book i traded the provisioner for before i left managed to get this and a bottle of wine for doing the dishes for three days the wine i am going to have to save for later that is part of my other plan which of course is getting delayed again i may just end up drinking the bottle myself if this keeps up growing talesinger moon of the 5th month after winter solstice 653  i am not one to keep journals normally as very few ulven will even be able to read it i suppose this is more for me to start keeping my thoughts straight being in hostile territory a few months now and having almost meet my death once already things are getting more stressful then i would like i need to start writing down what i learn so i can reference back to it later i am hoping this will help or should the worse happen i can hope that this will be found and returned to my pack or clan i had been at the outpost for almost a week watching how the outpost worked was interesting i would of loved some quiet time to have talked with quartermaster he gave me the impression that he was interested in what i thought and i was curious on how a stormjarl ended up quartermaster at the longfang outpost sadly those conversations never happened we all got wrapped up in our duties i did learn a lot about the area and some history of the region which was interesting and may have given me clues to some other issues i was originally there to get my arm looked at my shoulder was healing from a mordok arrow but my mobility was getting limited and painful the quartermaster was also a healer i wasnt sure how i was going to pay for it but gaia provides my services as a daughter became quite useful and my ability to read and write were put to the test there was a corrupted mordok site found the witches at the nearby village had a cleansing ritual but it was all written in old ulven runes i knew of the language but i never had the honor to actually see it i am not privileged enough to have access to the old scrolls the quartermaster had a basic understanding of the language as he was dabbling in the runes and gave me the assistant tavern keeper and the male syndar a basic alphabet and we three working steadily managed to translate the ritual into something that i and the quartermasters mate fritha could perform it was a two day cleansing ritual and we had no idea how the mordok were going to react and even translated it was still in a language i only sort of recognized i put my faith in gaia and ran with it we succeeded and i have made copies i was originally going to send back to my clan but apparently i am going to hand it to them in person i had planned to give copies to khulgar when i go see him as well i was going to go find him next but shit happens apparently this is beyond the war this affects directly our divine calling to protect the ground we walk on it was a tiring ritual but it felt good to perform it felt right i have a hard time putting into words the feeling of being connected to the mother on that level i convinced them to bring back the now cleansed idol for study i was going to give to the witches and priestess at onsallas village but they are too scared to take it they have the ungo smash mentality of a lot ulven i have seen recently even i know that if you just treat each symptom the disease the disease itself will never go away we need to have a better understand on whyhow and what powers are corrupting the mother while the cleansing ritual worked i dont know for how long it will work or should the corruption get bigger and deeper if it will be as effective i would also like to know if something like this has happened before there is obviously a ritual for it which make me believe that it may have i may need to track down a tale singer at some point after looking at the ground and physically being there feeling that taint press against the protections wards i believe that whatever it is the mordok are doing are what is causing the black marks appear on the mother in my first vision i now believe that that vision i had when i was stricken with poison and lay dying was real and that notion is scaring me then the second dream vision where i felt a presence it wanted me to follow it it had a motherly feel but it was too weak to show itself i know its not gaia gaia knows i follow her already the fact that i wield her love is proof of that she would not beckon me to do something i am already doing either way the stargazer pack has never had the gift of visions prophets or rune seers in any of its daughters or priestesses so this is completely freaking me out also arent i a little old for this most of the time these gifts come about when a daughter first realizes her gifts to top it all off since i am currently carrying this thing with me i am expecting more to happen before i get home i am not looking forward to this journey luckily i still have some pineed sap left so if i need to do the ritual again i can not what i originally want to do with the sap but as per the theme of the day shit happens i also need to get a message home before i get there so they can meet me on the border i dont want to take this into new territory without some back up i be stupid if i didnt take precautions with this thing so after the cleansing we had come upon the graveyard of what i was told was the blackwings though what i remember from the stories there was nothing of them to bury though this could of been the burial ground before they disappeared as i do know there were fights with the mordok there were white spears sticking out the ground but i dont remember the stories of their signature weapon being the spears though no matter i was distracted by the spiritual feel of the ground it was weird i knew the moment that we stepped foot on the ground that it was a graveyard i remember the quartermaster asking me if i knew where we were i remember stating that it looked like a graveyard truth is that i felt it more than the visual cue maybe it close brush with death recently that i was more sensitive at the time or maybe i was still charged from the ritual it was still disturbing to me that i seem have a sense what i was standing on before i knew it for sure it doesnt help my grown concern about being a visionist i was also concerned about how close the tainted mordok site was to the graveyard i wonder if its connected i pray its not i also got some interaction with the outsiders at the post i have come to the conclusion that the outsiders are just as diverse as the ulven the blacksmith that was there i do believe to have been touched in the head he was talking about how there was a utopia in the middle of the swamps and had me write a letter for him requesting aid from an emperor and congratulating a king and queen on their marriage now i am no expert on how human rule themselves but it seems to me to be counter intuitive to have both a king and queen and an emperor he told the that i wouldnt be to spell the kings name because it was in a language called yulfish i asked if the syndar could spell it but was told they wouldnt know the language either i dont put much stock in what he said the two syndar i meet the male seemed stable enough he had appeared to be in touch with his gods and helped to try and purge the mordok bile from rogar watching him leap through the fields like a rabbit was entertaining he seemed to be a fountain of energy he is also well versed in intellectual study as he knew how to read and write he helped me decode the ritual he also had a unique ability to find herbs quickly he had brought back quite a few his female on the other hand i wanted to grab by the point of her ear and twist like you do to a child who is misbehaving she shoved magrat away from her healing of rogar to shove a potion down his throat with only a few moments of warning that the potion was going to cause rogar to vomit i think she means well as she eventually donated all the herbs that her mate gathered to the outpost its hard to tell if her air headedness is an act or genuine though i also meet some of the vandregon i meet a man name william briefly he offered me his hand and i took it he was surprised that i didnt take his arm and i was surprised he knew our customs i remember my father taking the hands of humans in the rare instances that we ran into them on our journeys i just assume it was how humans prefer to interact he didnt seem to be insulted just surprised i only feel slightly bad for my social faux pas i hadnt known that they were ulven with in the vandregon until i meet belthazar nightriver later that day he is very talkative ulven and later rogar who either needs to get laid more often or needs to hit things more not sure which he seemed to have some anger issues either way the vandregon made sure i was protected to and from the ritual site to which i am grateful for i am not an adventurer nor do i pretend to be i met a young ulven named orrin he is a member of the bloodfangs he was looking for a relative by the name of marr i should keep an ear out for her he seemed really genuine in his need to find her i sense a potential in him he has the demeanor for a good truthseeker calm dutiful watchful he just needs someone to teach him how to ask questions and use his brain and his eyes though he still has all the energy of youth so that may be easier said than done also meet an interesting human by the name of double we didnt get to talk much but he seems to be in a field much like my own a neutral party seeking information he says that he works for the stability of all madrun and has offered me an interesting proposal hell get me information on starkhaven if i keep him apprised on how the ulven civil war is going this seems like a fair trade to me as we are both seeking information on places we cant get to because of our race i have to admit i am intrigued yet i still need to be cautious here i have a letter to the elders i need to write a letter to khulgar i need to write i still need him to confirm or deny what raskolf told me about the ill fated meeting and i have feeling that is a conversation i want to have with him in person i would also rather deliver the translation of this rite to him in person as well to make sure it gets to where it needs to i will also need to make sure raskolf get copies of this rite as well i should of given copies to stanrick before i left balls too much to do and i think its going to rain soon as well my shoulder is starting to hurt fantastic i tuck my new journal away i pull out a piece of parchment and my pen as i start to hear rain on to top of the lean to to high priestess morrigan with a sense of urgency i write this i have in my possession a cleansed mordok artifact of great power i also have the ritual that was used to cleanse said item i have enough reagents to perform the ritual at least one more time should it become necessary on my way back the ritual was translated from runic ulven i have both the translation and the original runic script i beseech you to send a few well trained witches and priestess to meet me on the edge of the territory in a weeks time the ritual is tiring and if i have to perform it on the road i am not sure what type of shape i will be in upon arrival i would like to have some back up waiting for me i am leery this artifact but i feel it is imperative that be studied so counter magic can be obtained i have seen with my own eyes and have felt the corruption that these idol contain these idols contaminated the land and warping the trees and vegetation surrounding it i know of at least two other items like this being found and destroyed previous though with mixed effects so far we have been treating the symptoms but not the disease i have many other thoughts right now about a lot of things i would like to talk to you personally about them once i get home and the idol is secure in service selena stargazer truth seeker i pack up the writing gear and seal the letter and make it ready to send either via hawk or runner depending on what i run into first i huddle down for the night i place my bag good arms length away and then draw a protective circle around the bag and then around myself and cast the same protection spell on myself that i did for the others for the ritual i glare at my bag i have a bad feeling and i cant seem to shake it its going to be a long walk homeyawn listened to the spirits whispering they told him things when to wait where how to hide in plain sight of his foes when to move when to strike  though he often knew well enough without their guidance hed come to trust them to know them solara gaia one and the same woman in his mind the spirits were hers nix most of all told him things his totem right now she told him the time was not right the day theyd marched into the pass nix told him to take up his bow leave his mace and shield behind nix who whispered the wind to his favor who kept him a half step ahead of all but one the red haired archer she who pierced his shoulder just before the last clash of that day before coming across the dying greytide who called him the one who turned his face from gaia he hadnt denied it hed not waste a dying warriors last breath with sentiments yawn gave him a clean quick end not an act of anger but one of respect between foes the weeks that came next were the worst supplies ran short yawn used every last resource hed carried in with him bandages rope tobacco drink everything to keep his friends  his family  as well as he could mange by the end hed cut even his spare shirt into bandages hed used what he knew to keep those dying among the living longer offering nix blood from his wounded shoulder slowing its mending ensuring a scar would take root there when he wasnt calling down the spirits or pulling mana from the earth around him he hunted with stannrick greytide and food in the end stannrick was the last man whole the one to go for help nix did all she could as well where to find food herbs hiding places everything but how to mend the wounds that she told yawn she could not yet give more was needed the time wasnt right was he not yet desperate enough despair and anger had he not risked enough for this true enough hed done it with a mind to protect his people no to save his people it was his choice none had forced him and he wanted to know if he could what daughter of gaia would have shown him the way to cast would the fieldcrow share their secrets with a male hed found a path and taken it just to see if he could reach its end and now it wasnt enough magrat that rage burned as well why should she give up who she is who her people are who were we to ask he filled the time trying to keep every one fed keeping the wounds clean poulticed his knowledge wasnt enough he couldnt speed the mending like a healer or a daughter could he did everything he could to keep their spirits up sang every song he knew spoke every tale of his his brother his family of siren his niece of thom of how his father won his mothers consent and when he ran out of tales true he told all the tall tales and legends hed learned of his journey into the dirge swamp and his dreams there though not all some hed yet to make peace with himself when those tales and songs ran dry he started making new ones until his voice cracked when the pipes went empty he dredged up sweet ferns dried them by the fire and filled them he made stew on the good days broth on the poor days when at last aid had arrived and a message hawk with it yawn took a mouth full of bread refreshed his quiver his pipe and composed a simple reply pipe cracking cheerily as if the past weeks had never happened supplies much need  and some of it was received morale could be better we wish it was you who brought them to us i will not return until the pass is secured yawn ps next time send the longfang longleafmaykar burely blend it fares better then the longleaf alone for cold travel of course what hed meant was that he was not returning not done laying bodies before the pyre until magrat had returned until his friend was free of her exile until he could walk through he gates of onsallas and embrace his friend his pack mate the thought of that day drifted between his ears as yawn step from his hiding place shield across his back mace quiver and spell components at his belt his mail dully glimmering the light the arrow nocked his target sighted the wind at his back and as his clever fingers let the string loose and the arrow sighed through the air toward the throat of a grey his arrow the spear point the first fang of the ambush the sun warming his back nix whispered in his ear as the point bit into its mark today will be a good day yawn as he nocked the second arrow he smiled nix never lied about such thingsi trudged down the path pausing briefly to look behind me i could still see the longfang warrior watching me once i hit the main trail i turned toward the direction that raskolf had mentioned i quietly hoped there was a village or some such there i was tired like a sole worn through this was now the second time i have had to leave a grievously injured person although both times there were people with healing arts around my soul screamed at me to go back and fix them the urge to scream and break something was high but i quietly swallowed my frustration and tried to turn my thoughts to what i had just learned i groaned out loud as i realized what i was going to have to do i was going to have to get khulgar to confirm or deny what happened at those illfated peace talks i banged my head out of annoyance against my staff as i walk i understood now why he glossed over it when i talked to him about it the first time but i still couldnt assume what raskolf said is the whole story i would be failing my job as truth seeker if i didnt at least attempt to get both sides of the story truth as i learned is often somewhere in the middle its never just what one side or other said especially if their stories dont match balls i swore loudly i was still contemplating how to do that when i start see structures though the trees oh thank gaia i murmured when i saw people stopping what they were doing to look at me i had found a coywolf camp it appeared to be a seasonal hunting camp and people were working on getting things opened up for the season there were maybe four families working this land they eyed me suspiciously as i paused on the outskirts i sighed a little as i wait remembering a time when strangers were a more welcomed sight as it normally meant a new face to talk to new stories to hear and possibility trade and new items to buy depending on who was coming through eventually a male about my age approached me and greeted me though i could still see the suspicion in his eyes his demeanor softened slightly once i returned the greeting and explained what i was doing there i dont have anything of value to trade for room and board for the night but i will happily cook you a meal and watch the children while you all work i bartered i felt ashamed i had no real trade skill to speak of even my skills as a daughter were but novice at best the most i could often do is officiate a handfasting ceremony a funeral or cleansing i knew all of these are important but every pack has their own way of doing things so wandering daughters arent in high demand i had never learned how to really tend wounds outside the healing the mother allows me my father was the one who knew how to make the sap bandages we often traded for armor and weapons i just know parts of it i often times feel useless the male studied me for a long while before finally agreeing this was a family group two brothers and two older cousins working this area with their families there was one large farm house everyone stayed in bo and astrid had two children dagmar the oldest daughter was about 12 seasons dane was the younger brother who appeared to be about 7 bos brother jakob and his wife laila just had their first child mikkel who was a healthy baby boy of about 6 months agetha and olaf were older cousins their children had left home already anders and annelise had an older son enjar who was about 16 he was already an accomplished hunter and was helping set up the camp he just got his marks a few months ago and it appears the great wolf likes him his younger brother erik was about 5 though i would guess he was really a half brother i could see the mothers appearance in his eyes but his hair color and complexion looked nothing like his father dagmar helped me make dinner that she really knew her spices was an excellent help in the kitchen dane played with erik while mikkel hung from a wrap around my shoulder i tried hard not to dwell on the fact that mikkel and erik are the same ages that asiegar and moira would of been lucky dagmar and dane where both curious as well which kept me from dwelling too much they were asking me questions as we cooked about where i was from what was i doing there what parts of mardrun i had seen what everspring grove was like they kept asking question all the way through dinner their mother told them to hush so i could eat i learned their main camp isnt far from here maybe three miles there are also a couple other well established coywolf camps in this area i asked how far it was to onsallas i wanted to get my hands on some pineed sap to take back to the clan onsallas was nearly a week away on foot they told me that at least gave me a better mental picture of the land the clan had trees that produced pineed sap but everyone knows the sap from the swamp region is better and they are the first set of trees to wake up from the winter sleep our trees wont wake for another two to three weeks after the onsallas trees start erik had gotten into my bag when we werent paying attention and was fascinated with the parchment and ink i managed to get the ink quills and the important paper away from him before he spilled something on them i did give him some scrap parchment and one of my graphite sticks to draw with dane came over and was looking at the copy of the treaty that raskolf wrote over my shoulder he asked if that was important and i nodded i told him that this was a copy of the treaty that the watchwolves had written bo asks me to read it to them so they can actually hear what it said first hand they like a lot of other ulven had only heard about it from their talesingers who heard about it second or third hand as the night grew late the children were ushered off to bed the adults went off to bed shortly thereafter i stayed down in the main room and worked there was a flat surface and plenty of light from the fire and lamps so i worked on transcribing that treaty so my clan could have a copy i must have fallen asleep at the table as i was woken by that sound that all ulven know instinctively one that sends a cold rush down your spine i could hear the grunts and shuffling of mordok just outside of the settlement i quickly and quietly pack up my writing supplies and slung them over my shoulder as the adults crept down the stairs weapons in hand we shared a glance and i knew what they wanted i was the guest as the rules of hospitality state hosts protect the guests though often times the guests will join the fray as a thank you to the hosts this case there are the young children my duty was to get the children to safety children too young to fight as they dont have their marks yet most children are trained in fighting as soon as they can hold a weapon but most parents wont let them go out looking for a fight until after they get their marks i am sure these children knew how to use the weapons they were holding but the fear and apprehension in their eyes told me that they have never faced mordok before laila kissed mikkel before she gave the sling to me i secured him to my chest and wrapped a heavy piece of leather around the sling for added protection dane wanted to stay with his parents and fight but bo convinced him he had to go and protect his cousin giving the boy one of his daggers dagmar had a mace and shield though the shield seemed too awkward for her enjar volunteered to accompany me stating that since i was carrying the baby i could not fight as well i could see the flicker of relief cross his parents face i cast gaias protection on the children but ran out of mana before i could do enjar its okay he smiled the great wolf will hear my name better this way the parents went charging out the front door my heart grew heavy as i watched them go i was pretty sure i wasnt going to see them again enjar lead the way out the back we weaved our way to the road enjar and i both spotted movement off to our left and just in time to see an arrow bounce off of dagmars protection i scream at them to start running like the great wolf is chasing them as three mordok break through the trees two archers and fighter i make sure the children are ahead of me and manage to deflect one arrow heading toward my face with my staff enjar confronted the fighter i call to him begging him to not be a hero and start after the children i managed to get the attention of both of the archers as i turned to run i hear the whiz but my back is turned already and i feel the burning as a cross bow bolt tip shoot out of my right shoulder and another arrow grazes my right thigh i kept running holding mikkel screaming form to my chest with my good arm i quickly catch up to the pack of children and i can hear enjar behind me i glance back he is bleeding from his sword arm and left leg and it look like his knee may be dislocated as well keep running i hiss to everyone dane was trying to keep the now hysterical erik moving once erik saw his brothers injuries i turn as dagmar screams flinging out her arms instinctively as a mordok leaps from the trees the mordok is thrown back and crashes hard into a tree and slumps down i only had a few moment to look on in wonder before i realize that just happened i quickly give dagmar mikkels bundle i told her if any more mordok did that to do what she just did again about half way to the camp the mordok stopped chasing us erik calls that he can see the camp fire ahead and the children get a new burst of energy and sprint to entrance enjar and dane both look over their shoulders at me as i stop and lean on my staff the world blurs as i realize that the cross bow bolt was probably poisoned balls i mutter as the world goes dark around me i awoke under a willow tree the forest was dark around me and the few stars above me looked like diamonds i had no wounds on me and my clothes were in one piece damn i guess im dead i mutter not yet sis i heard a voice i sat bolt upright rune was leaning against an oak tree i walked over to him then why the hell are you here i went to punch him in the arm but my hand passed through youre not dead yet come we dont have time to fool around someone wants to talk to you he pushed off the tree and started up the path at a quick pace i followed not sure what else to do we entered a clearing that looked remarkably like the clearing that i am fond of near everspring i could see my mom and dad talking with grandma fraya and torolf around a fire near the back side of the clearing in front a long house that wasnt normally there i heard a low growl from my right sitting on the the rocky outcropping where i like to watch the sky from was a large black wolf he turned his yellow eyes to me as rune and i entered the edge of the clearing the power washed over me and i started to tremble i thought you said i wasnt dead i hiss to rune i could see my family stand and peer at me from the fire torolf made a motion to come towards me but grandma fraya grabbed his arm and shook her head i could see their mouths move but i was too far away to hear what they said it dawned on me that i havent seen my kids rune where are my children i asked slowly as the wolf stretched and leapt from the out cropping and slowly started to stalk in my direction rune pointed to the sky and i only spared a moment to look up above me two stars appeared brighter then the others their twinkle quickened as i looked at them the story goes children who are killed before they receive their markings from the great wolf are often turned into stars so they can guide the living and earn their place since they were not given the opportunity to earn it in life stars that fall from the sky are children that have earned their place and are returning to be with their families gaia and the great wolf movement out of the corner of my eye caused me to turn my head and i saw a woman come out of the trunk of a fir tree she casually reached up and the branches turned into a robe for her she was strikingly beautiful long black hair and bright blue eyes pale skin she had no marking neither eye nor fang she radiated a calming aura about her she smiled a little as she noticed me the large wolf strolled up beside the woman and turned into the form of a man before my eyes he wass strikingly handsome wellchiseled tan with coal black hair and the same yellow eyes he had as a wolf and wearing just as much clothing he wrapped his arm around this womans waist from behind and leaned his head on her shoulder looking at me with those same piercing yellow eyes his fangs were visible on his upper and lower jaw even in this humanoid form she isnt supposed to be here yet my love he grumbled the woman reached up and touched his cheek i know dear but i called her here she needs to know how important it is that she figures out a way to get the rest of the children back on the path seeing them fight each other like this hurts me i looked down at the ground such simple gesture but filled with so much love and the sense of home that filled this clearing caused tears to well up in my eyes i looked back up across towards the fire and torolf the man gave an exasperated sigh and let her go stalking back towards the fire fear welled up inside of me wondering if he was going to attack my family i started to make a forward motion and the women got in my way worry not she smiled at me you know what you have to do you have been sensing it the entire time listen to me and i will guide you but its important that you succeed she showed me the back side of her left arm black wounds dotted her perfect skin this will only get worse she stated i frowned concerned how much time do i have i asked she let the sleeve drop on her robe i do not know i have never had anything like this happen before i do not think it is all connected to my children fighting either there are other powers here but i cannot describe them nor can i figure out where they came from she placed her hand on my head but i think you will help figure it out i looked down at the ground i dont think i can do this by myself she giggled you are not supposed to one person can never do it alone this is why we taught you all about packs and hunting parties you have allies you just have to trust yourself and others once you find them you may have to form a party with those outside your clan in order to fix this i blink a few times as my mind tried to process this my eyes went wide as i realized something i collapsed to my knees and exposed my throat to the women in the rite of contrition  i have ignored your calling not once by twice there were injured and i walked away  she leaned down and took my hand helping me to my feet you are forgiven child i realize you carry a heavy burden trying to balance all that i have asked of you this will not be the last time you are forced to walk away from an injured person either and for that i apologize you have sound judgment trust in that i gave you instincts for a reason child use them the growling voice came from so close that the only reason i didnt jump twenty feet was because the woman was still holding my hand i heard rune stifle a snicker the wolf had returned and torolf was right behind him the wolf punched torolf in the arm and huffed the spell is almost done you dont have much time torolf took my hand and pulled me into a hug his scent filling my nose i start to sob shhh dont cry he smiled and wiped my tear i just want you to be happy i know you love me and ill be here when your time comes you have a long journey ahead of you dont do it alone promise me you will open yourself up to love again torolf smirked ill buy him some ale when he gets here as well i smiled a little fine i promise he grinned thatss what i wanted to hear he leaned over and kissed my forehead i felt myself being ripped from his arms torolf i screamed as i felt like i was falling from some impossible height torolf i yelled as i bolted upright the pain that rushed over my body almost made me pass out again i stifled a sob as the curtain to the tent was thrown aside and dagmar stood there holding a bowl of water she stuck her head back out of the tent and yelled that i was awake in rushed a older woman with yellow eyes and upper fangs she forced me to lay back down child you had us worried i wasnt sure we could cure the poison that had gotten into your system you almost died on me once she explained how long have i been out i asked almost three days she answered i lay there and stared at the roof for awhile while the older woman fussed your leg wound was minor enough but you are going to need to make the trek to onsallas to find a proper healer for your shoulder i got rid of the poison and closed the wound but you will need the supervision of a more skilled daughter or healer then i to make sure your shoulder heals and still maintains its mobility i sighed understood what of the children i asked the older woman smiled they are all here and alive enjar was pretty beat up as well but he will survive what about their parents i asked she looked down at the floor that camp is over run with mordok nobody can get close currently to check we are pretty sure that they are all dead but we cant get close enough to retrieve bodies we will be burning effigies at the end of the week until then the scouts are trying to get confirmation i nodded and the other lady frowned at me either way you lie there and rest you arent going anywhere until i say so nobody could get close enough to the settlement to retrieve the bodies but the scouts did report seeing all the bodies the children were devastated i stayed till the end of the week and helped with the effigies the morning after the rite i packed my things and left after getting clearance from the old medicine woman enjar accompanied on my trek to onsallas as well as some other novice daughter word had come that onsallas was looking for aid for the harvest and were seeking help with some other problems luckily we got there with no other incidentraskolf vakr selena stargazer a lone figure walked warily along the path she wasnt carrying much a pack and a shoulder bag and a well worn staff in hand she wore little armor strange among the heavily geared warriors that had been the only occupants of the pass her paced slowed and she stops well outside the encampment and waited a warrior in leather armor and a black helmet approaches her stopping about ten paces away another ulven looks on bearded and wearing face paint a bow rests easy in his hand but no arrow is nocked the two ulven eye the traveler for a long moment identify yourself the helmeted warrior calls gruffly but not aggressively the traveler sizes them up back then smiles i am selena stargazer of pack stargazer i am a truth seeker for clan spiritclaw selena offers her arm showing her lack of weapons and lack of hostility the guard stares at her proffered arm for a moment before gripping it in kind stanrick longfang i suppose you are here to speak with the ambassador then selena cocked her head a little i suppose i am i was told to find someone named raskolf i had heard he was here though i was unaware that he was an ambassador he is raskolf is the voice of the watchwolves as well as warder to the clan high priestess i will send for him stay here before long stanrick returned to escort selena back into a cave with a small fire burning within there are a few badly wounded warriors lying about and there are bloodstains on the stone of the floor one of them seems exceptionally unwell he is propped against a shield and though he is covered in a blanket he is shivering noticeably even in the firelight it is obvious that his color is poor and that he is sweating profusely selenas eyes linger on the grievously wounded warrior for a moment she clenched her jaws together tightly and turned her eyes to the floor forcing herself to move forward a male emerges from the back of the cave equally covered in fur armor and bandages he offers his forearm as he introduces himself i am raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolves and ambassador what has brought you to the hackles from the shadows an imposing female warrior in heavy armor watches the two closely her hand resting on the hilt of her sword quietly making it known that the ambassador was not unprotected and that not everyone here was as trusting selenas eyes take in the ambassadors bandages as she smiles and grips his arm her eyes flick to the female warrior before she introduces herself i come from a clan who is still neutral in this war we have been getting updates of what been going on sporadically at best and often second and third hand so they have sent me as a truth seeker to verify the accounts of how this started so they can make an informed decision on what sides to take if any in the end i have already run across a battle for a village a few days back and had the interesting opportunity to speak with khulgar graytide himself when i got to the other side of battle field i did talk to the commander there a female whose name i was unable to get as things where starting to getintense she gave me your name as the person to talk to i originally though i was going to have to trek all the way to onsallas to find you raskolf nodded and sat down gesturing for selena to do the same over a year ago i drafted a resolution stating that there were certain rules that the colonists would have to follow in regards to respecting our lands and our gods they were burying their dead in the ground you see our resolution was delivered to the human nobility at new hope by khulgar graytide they mistreated him disrespected him and chased him from their dinner telling him that these were their lands now and that they would do as they wished khulgar wanted to go to war with them immediately but my clan was able to cool things down with diplomacy within a few months the colonies were complying with our wishes and cremating their dead rather than polluting the earth with burials that wasnt good enough for clan grimward they attacked and razed a human settlement that bordered their lands not only that but the graytides took trophies from the slain colonists ears fingers and even bones i organized a peace summit within grimward territory and brought with me the ambassadors and delegates of the human colonies as well as representatives from clan nightriver it was an ambush the grimwards attacked us in their own hall during a peace summit and assassinated most of the human delegates we barely escaped with out lives the grimwards never wanted peace especially pack graytide and why should they khulgars mate was murdered by humans under a flag of truce there was a noise from the female that might or might not have been a smothered snarl for my people it is a matter of honor treaties and tenets must be upheld if we violate the laws which we ourselves have written then what does that make us raskolf sighed and looked to the mouth of the cave i have met many humans and syndar in my travels for the most part they are good people and i have been privileged to call some of them friends but they are a haunted people and cursed they are in many ways like a cornered and desperate animal i would rather befriend such a creature then try to fight a mad dog we could not have prevailed against the lich without their help and our charity towards them in the past was what forged the loyalty that brought soldiers of vandregon to stand with us and defend our territory from the grimwards selena listened carefully running her hand over her face of course this wouldnt be easy she sighed heavily to herself she rifled through the messenger bag at her side careful to do so deliberately and within plain sight of the guard you wouldnt happen to have a copy of that resolution would you i would like something to compare the copy i got from khulgar she pulled out a sheath of well worn and much folded parchment i am pretty sure they will match but i want to just be sure before i make a copy and send it to my clan leaders leaning against the cave wall for a moment selena shuffled the stack of paper looking for something in particular as for the everything elsethe good news is at least the mistreatment of khulgar matches the rest i think is going to give me a headache we may want to get comfortable i have a lot of questions she frowned at the papers in front of her unsure where she should start finally she shrugged i am going to start with the attempt at a truce meeting was there any attempt at talking between grimwards and nightriver before the grimward attacked did they really attack first or was it more of a mutual shooting of insults back and forth till one side lost it and out of curiosity why where the outsiders there i do not have a copy of the resolution here this is a cave and we are in a warzone to answer your question though the nightrivers never got a chance to speak when asked about the graytides violation of the old nightriver treaty haygreth said that the legendary honor duel was a fake and that the nightriver treaty meant nothing the outsiders came along to brief the grimwards on the lich and propose an alliance against the undead a priest from crows landing was standing in front of haygreth grimward asking for his hand in friendship when it all went south the old man was unarmed and unarmored haygreth murdered him in cold blood even as he asked to clasp forearms there were dozens of witnesses the grimwards and graytides were prepared for that attack they tried to trap us in the hall and as we fled there were more grimwards waiting for us outside and even on the road they would have killed us all but our warpack leader imglyf challenged their own warpack leader wargah grimward daughter of haygreth to an honor duel imglyf won the duel but wargah cheated with magic and so was taken prisoner by my guards we conducted a prisoner exchange with the grimwards and that was the only thing that earned us safe passage from their lands selena nods not looking up from the clean piece of parchment she was taking notes on so i have read this treaty and it only makes reference to the aldorians and their princess or exiled princess who are the aldorians are the aldorians the people of hew hope what of starkhaven is this a different group of outsiders not covered by the treaty i have been told that starkhaven has been encroaching and taking grimward territory by force i am trying to understand who the treaty was trying to protect  it encompasses all human colonists new aldoria is just one of the colonies new hope is another and crows landing too i myself did not know the difference between the colonies either when i drafted that treaty but it was in reference to all the colonists we had the full support of clan grimward prior to that disastrous political dinner where khulgar was mistreated i wish that i had been able to attend in his place but i was on a different diplomatic mission to new aldoria to meet with their leader and avert a war as far as encroachment on grimward territory starkhaven began sailing their boats upriver and attacking the grimwards after that priest was killed by haygreth they have not taken any territory as far as i know they simply raid the riverbanks and coastal villages and then leave the men of starkhaven are few in number but they are very heavily armored and all of them seem to be spell casters the resolution itself was supposed to secure our ability to live in harmony in the future it laid down rules that the colonists needed to follow in order to respect our gods and the lands that are our sacred charge it was meant to protect all people on mardrun ulven or otherwise selena frowns i see she holds out her copy of the treaty you wrote it you should be able to tell me if this is what you wrote raskolf took the copy and studied it carefully that is what i wrote there were amendments made to it later after the humans complied with it the bastards it turned out had never gotten any of my messages though the reports i had received at the time from the graytides stated that my messengers had been killed by the bastards they also complied immediately although they turned over the idol to the nightrivers instead of the longfangs as far as the new aldorians go the soldiers who tried to frame myself and the captain of crows landing were working for a rival politician in new hope and trying to start a war between the ulven and the new aldorians that plot was uncovered and the man behind it arrested you also made reference to another older nightriver treaty which treaty was that selena shook her head a little my apologies for the tedious questions i am just trying to figure out how we strayed so far from the path gaia laid out before us i am trying to get a sense if this war is something new or something old that couldnt be let go of and they are now using this new thing as an excuse to bring up old grudges that should of been left behind in the circle her head jerks up the mention of the idol balls she shakes her head again i had received a hawk from khulgar saying the that idol was in longfang hands i was hoping it was here so that i could see it i wasnt going to cleanse it or anything like that i was going to leave that to more skilled daughters and witches thenbut i was hoping she trailed off not sure how to explain the old nightriver treaty from when the colonists first arrived was what originally gave them permission to settle in nightriver territory the colonists earned that right when a human knight faced an ulven warchief in an honor duel the nightriver beat up the human knight very badly but the human refused to yield despite his grievous injuries he showed so much heart that the nightriver backed down and yielded out of respect a treaty was signed that gave a small piece of coastal land to the colonists new aldoria new hope starkhaven and crows landing were all part of this land and it is all in nightriver territory the idol has been tended to properly a human sage identified it as the likeness of an evil god from the old world and was greatly concerned that the thing had found its way here by itself such a thing is not dangerous but once people start believing in it again and it has followers well that is another story the member of the bastards who had been keeping the idol before was haunted by strange nightmares and gripped by madness until his brothers forcibly took the thing from him hopefully that god has been contained now so that it may be forgotten selena nods we had heard the story differently we had heard the duel ended in a draw both sides where pretty beat up impressed by their stamina the nightrivers gave the outsider land i had heard the idol was mordok in origin though she shakes her head again if she wasnt careful this whole debacle would have her shaking her head of her body there is a large widespread believe that the outsiders brought the undead with them i am not entirely sure i believe that my family had bartered to stay an inn that was in one of the northern villages the night the lich came we had no idea what those creatures were i lost everything that night but i know for a fact that the lich came out of the swamp no humans live there nothing lives there save for mordok i was hoping that this idol was going to help prove my theory it would of meant one less thing for everyone to fight about she smiles wearily that is really everything i can think of now ill get out of your hair and let you tend to your wounded she gathered up her papers and tucked them back in to her shoulder bag oh i do have one more question where is the closest village to here i have a lot to report back and would really like a flat surface to work on not to mention a warm meal and something other then the cold ground to sleep on for a night its been along time since i had traveled this area apparently where i remember villages being there are none anymore raskolf smiled at selena there are coywolf traveler shelters and hunting lodges along these trails leading all the way east into the nightriver territory i dont know if any of them are occupied we cannot go to them harlok will die if we move him and im not sure that i myself could make the trek either i took four arrows the other day and got pretty bloodied in the melee as well besides we cannot abandon our post or this will all have been for naught you came from the west and met with the graytides have our lines held selena looks down at the ground they did not she said quietly what ever village i came from the graytides had superior numbers when they took it the female commander there was gravely injured she kept yelling at khulgar something about being lied too as she was being carried back to the healer i do not think she died as i do not recall see her body on the pyre atari should be commended one of the young soldiers flipped out when she saw the state of the commander and came stalking into the room where they held a gravely wounded graytide she threatened the captive and he talked her down there was a captive swap later the wounded male for a healer i do not know who the healer was or even if she was ulven i was too far way to see if she had marks after the swap the watchwolves pulled back to the outside the village and made camp i stayed and helped collect the bodies and made sure the that funeral rites were done properly raskolf rubbed his forehead i feared as much selena continued to study the ground it seems like we are at the same place we were before just now reversed they had the pass and you had the village now you have the pass and they have a village same place but now we are all weaker for it she slowly lifted her head i should go beforei do something stupid and break my vow to my clan leader about not taking sides before its time i have not seen a healer or daughter walk by to check on your injured since i got here do you have anyone that can heal raskolf shook his head our daughter is but a novice she has done all she can selena let out a breath like she had been holding it and didnt realize it oh thank gaia i was fearing you where going to tell me that your healer had died or some such sadly i am not any better then a novice myself someone even a novice is better then nobody at all though she gathered her things i may have questions again later as i try to sort this all out for my elders may i contact you again if need be of course ambassador stargazer selena paused a moment in a confusion shrugging after a moment of contemplation she had never considered that was what she was doing huh never been called that before  she got her pack settled looking raskolf straight in the eye be safe dont die i have this feeling you are going to be important in helping end this on her way out selena stops before the gravely wounded warrior she set her staff aside and placed one hand on her heart and raised one hand toward the warrior in blessing she spoke loud enough that everyone nearby could hear great mother let your children feel your presence guiding them in times of uncertainty and rage let your strength and love surround us in times of pain and loneliness may we walk the path you laid be for us so we may meet you at the great house when our journey has ended she touched the shivering male lightly focusing on him entirely for a moment dont you die either you hear me too many have already and even i can tell that there are too many here that still need you  she picks up her staff and headed out gaia be with you in your travels raskolf called selena merely smiled and wavedselena stargazer i had spent weeks walking through the wilderness alone it gave me plenty of time to plan out in my head how i thought this would go i had this thought that i would go to a couple of prominent villages talk to some mid range lackeys confirmed that the stories were either true or not and i would be back on my way home before the trees even finished blooming i had thought that it was going to be easy that this whole thing was some sort of huge misunderstanding once both sides realized what was going on we could forget this war and go back to our normal lives instead after weeks of walking i finally find a village and start looking forward to a warm meal and a soft warm place to sleep to find that i in my infinite wisdom have somehow found the one and only village for miles that just happens to be the target of khulgar graytide you know that plan i had been daydreaming about for weeks as i walked i think i see it melting in the snow along with my thought of being home before summer the only good news to come out of that is that i at least got one side of the story first handmostly there were parts left out and giossed over parts i could sense had importance but when one is in the middle of a fight one doesnt ask for lots of details especially from khulgar graytide good news is i have contact with one of his underlings so if i need clarification or confirmation i can send a bird if he answers me is another story but i will cross that bridge when i come to it i understand now why he volunteered to give the decree i also understand how it went so very very wrong if what he said happened happened he is a very charismatic intelligent well spoken prideful male i poke my campfire with a stick and sighed heavily trying hard to shake off the loneliness that been plaguing me since i set out i made camp far enough away from either side to make it clear i can not take sides but still close enough that if something jumped me i can still call for help one or both side may come running or neither who knows hopefully i dont have to test this theory tonight neither side offered to let me stay nor should they i suppose i stayed to make sure the funeral rites were properly observed i was not asked to do rites thankfully khulgars forces are big enough that there are a few witches among them so there was no need i stayed to witness i needed to i still have a hard time accepting that we would kill each other even when i do see it with my own eyes this war has turned a normally friendly people fearful of their own family i cant say i nor gaia really approve i learned a lot today from just watching the fight and how both sides behaved not just the information i got from khulgar though i have no idea how to form into words that would make sense the feelings i sensed i am a daughter of gaia i feel her love her love for her children is what allows me to heal and save others i put another log on the fire and pull my cloak closer winter is hanging on like a stubborn wolf i chuckle to myself as stubbornness along with pride seems to be the theme of the day i looked passed the fire i could see the two sides fire lights from where i was the watchwolves just outside the village sulking fiercely watching the other side for weakness an opening something graytides forces celebrating their victory but at least giving respect to the fallen and doing so away from the funeral pyre well most of them anyways i frown as i look back into my own fire they graytides earned their victory today but i wonder at what cost to gaia and to the ulven as a whole i fear that our real enemies is waiting till we are at our weakest before it strikes again be it the mordok or the undead just cause the lich is gone doesnt mean the undead is gone and i still feel that the lich is connected to the mordok but i have no proof and i cant rule out that the graytides might be right in the notion that the outsiders brought it with them it is definatly is topic that need to be truth seeked before a decision on weather the outsiders are the core of the undead problem or not can be reached i pulled out a piece of parchment a graphite stick and a writing board ill write the formal letter in ink when i have a warm tavern and a flat surface to write on right now i think my ink is frozen anyways i glared annoyed at the snow that surrounds my little camp and my sad small tent its going to be a cold night alone i shake my head to focus i need to write down the information i have before i forget and no time like now to write a rough draft to clanleader spirtclaw and high priestess morrigan i have finally made it to contested territory between grimwards and nightriver clans i was not roaming long before i was meet by a scouting party apparently on the look out for watchwolves i was first taken to huge older male with only one arm when i had introduced myself and held out my hand it was coldly turned down the young female sheepishly asked me for my weapons i think embarrassed by her elder and the predicament she was about to put me in but i handed over my staff and was lead to the war leader the older man followed behind me and chided me about distrust i replied back about manners and tradition and how it was rude to just dismiss someone regardless if you trust them or not it was like they had forgotten the ways of hospitality i was ulven not some outsider this disturbed me greatly i was taken before none other than khulgar graytide himself i will not lie i was not completely prepared for that i was expected some random war leader who the great wolf barely heard of not khulgar himself i will tell you that he is an impressive male well spoken intelligent and very charismatic but also prideful i made full introductions and this time my hand was not turned away which told me alot in and of itself i was quite surprised that khulgar seemed to have at least a rough idea of what my job was as truth seeker was and we talked even as battle was about to start which also told me alot i will just write down the important parts of our conversation there was some testing of the waters as we sized each other out for awhile the dinner does seem to be the place this started the outsiders did disgrace and humiliate khulgar though when i asked why he didnt challenge them as per our traditions i was told that the outsiders dont value honor and traditions the same way we do there was apparently an attempt at peace between the nightriver and grimwards and apparently it ended in violence but was not giving details on how it broke down we were after all on a battlefield and i didnt press i am hoping to find out more details from the other side and if i have to verify with khulgar i will i was also told that the outsiders from starkhaven have been forcefully encroaching on grimward territory and taking it by force if needed there was also mention of a mordok artifact i am not sure how this plays into anything i was surprised hadnt been destroyed i am also hoping to receive at some point a copy of the watchwolves original treaty to the outsiders so i may see for myself what it said and how it was worded i shall make a copy and send it via bird to you once i have it myself i know we had heard about the treaty from our tale singers but we never received an actual copy of the treaty in talking with khulgars troops there seems to be a widespread belief that the outsiders brought the undead with them that it is somehow the outsiders fault that the lich happened even though when presented with the known fact that the lich came out of the dirge swamps where we all know nothing lives save for mordok they where fervent in their belief and countered that we burn our dead and the undead wherent a problem here before they arrived i didnt not correct them on the notion that we too bury our greatest criminals after killing them because they are not fit to journey with the great wolf i was out numbered and did not wish to be lynched passion was starting to outweigh reason as stated i am hoping to verify some of these statements when i go speak with the other side unfortunately when i was free to go talk to the watchwolves side the battle was pretty fierce and there was no one there who could talk to me but i was given a name raskolf i have no idea who this is either but was told he would be the best person to speak too about all this at least from the watchwolves side of it my next destination will be onsallas outpost i have been told that may be a good place to look for raskolf i am also hoping to be there in time to catch one of the first harvests of sap i have a feeling if i could make some sap imbued bandages for both trade and myself it may be of use trying to stay neutral and not help one side or the other is alot harder then one thinks there is death and pain all around and it pulls on my heart and in my soul i am not sure how long i will be able to ignore gaias call to me also i need to look into getting stronger armor then my travel leathers the fighting when started is brutal and should i actually get attacked here by either side i will not last long with my current armor i look up from my board thinking i heard someone approaching peering into the darkness i dont see anyone i sigh and go over what i had just wrote altering words here and there to try and make it more formal i glance up at the sky though the trees and frown even the stars here seem strange to me i go and pull out a few more sheets of parchment i have a lot to say and i am not sure how much of it the clan leaders will care about but i feel i need to include everything i will try and describe what i witnessed when the fighting started there was a lot of taunting and name calling like a bunch of cubs trying to goad the others into throwing the first punch you could sense that they knew that this was wrong neither side really wanted to fight khulgar gave them the option many times to surrender the watchwolves of course did not there is alot of pride on both side to the point where i think it clouds judgment there was a female alpha in charge on the village side i never did get her name but she was the one who told me about raskolf khulgar had superior numbers while some of the village member stayed and fight many of them were beyond their prime well skilled but did not have the stamina anymore the village had captured one of khulgars men his name is ekaj they had originally asked me if i could heal him as he was badly wounded i stated i could not but i would look in on him he was being cared for by artai of the watchwolves his wounds where grave i struggled over my duty as a truth seeker and my duty as a daughter with him already being care for my duty as a truth seeker won this time i had only caught snippets of their conversation as i didnt want to seem rude and i was a little concerned about being jumped thought i got the sense the even among the troops on both sides there is doubt that this war will benefit gaia no matter what side wins ekaj wasnt particularly happy to see me but bid me to tell khulgar that he had been captured i looked to artai and he nodded saying i would be doing him a great honor since both sides bid me to i figured i wasnt helping one side over the other and went and found khulgar who chided me for bothering him because he was busy i nodded and apologized but passed on the message that was asked of me though khulgar corrected me on the pronunciation of the name the dialect here is weird to me its been awhile since i had traveled these lands i then watched khulgar kill some poor young warrior who sadly try to challenge khulgar to a duel i also noticed that one of khulgar betas he appeared to be a hunter of some sort giggling and toy with another young warrior who tried to take him on i worry that a portion of the grimward forces have been touched by lunacy i made my way back to ekaj and artai and let them know that the message has been delivered through the doorway i witness the body of the female alpha being carried back she was greatly injured and she was screaming that they had lied to you khulgar she was quickly surrounded by a human healer and troops i do not know if she lived or not though i do not remember seeing her on the funeral pyre one of the village defenders was outraged and came in threatening ekaj about this female alpha dying and getting fair treatment for the captured atari quickly talked her down it appears that neither side has great control of the warriors beneath them this may or may not be useful the fighting sounded closer and quickly khulgars forces had made it to the building that we were at i watched as khulgar negotiated for ekaj and ekaj was traded for someone i dont know at that point the watchwolves realized their loss and pulled back i stayed help gather the dead from both sides and watched to make sure that the rites were done correctly and everyone got sent on their journey in conclusion my next course is to find this raskolf i will send another letter once i have found and talked to him i am hoping to have found him with in the next moon cycle at onsallas outpost i also feel that the truth of starkhaven should be sought as well though this is alot more tricky and am not sure how to do this yet if they are attacking grimwards with out provocation just to get land this lends credit to the grimward claims but i am not convinced that its all outsiders doing this so do not currently support the notion that they all need to die i also feel that the truth about the outsiders and the undead needs to be sought as well i am not convinced that the two are linked yet thought not sure how to start this inquest either i strongly feel that negotiation between clan nightriver and clan grimward is still possible once it is learned why the first attempt broke down that we may yet get them to the table again with proper use of bribery and decorum though i fear if this war lasts much longer its going to take a gathering of a grand moot to accomplish this in service selena stargazer of pack stargazer truthseeker to clan spirtclaw i finish my letter and look around the sounds from the other camps seem to be winding down i pack my tools away and stand to stretch my legs i wandered over to a larger clearing to study the sky before turning in for the night the sky does look weird here like there is more stars here then there should be i finally find the first star and figure out what direction i need to go in i mentally add to the list of things i need to trade for a map it has apparently been many years since my family had traveled this way as nothing really looks familiar to me anymore i get back to my tent and pull the warming rocks out of my furs and set them back in the fire adding one more log and giving the fire a good stir before turning in i am still wishing for a warm meal and a soft warm place to sleep but now i am also wishing for some wine as i can already tell the things i have seen today are not going to let me sleep well tonightmagrat farwalker their escorts did not speak with her much of course they were always civil always polite but sometimes she caught them watching her from the corners of their eyes and conversations would stop when she neared it irritated her she wanted to suddenly turn on them and hiss maybe lick her fangs to see if these warriors would flinch she resisted the urge the ulven had demanded that the colonists respect their ways of life their culture magrat could see the colonists trampling the lands and customs they came across and she had agreed with the ulven she had even silently agreed with khulgar once though further discussions with him had become rather impolite and she would now rather see his tongue on the end of her knife than flapping about in his pig head they were guests in anothers home she didnt know what the ulven wanted beyond that respect though did they want everyone to become little lesser ulven their great wolf had no place for humans and syndar her religion was one of her last ties with her homeland and her people and she would be damned if she would give it up because the ulven found it distasteful or inconvenient she and stanrick sat quietly though they had both always tended to be laconic the return trip was quieter than usual she didnt much know what to say and stanrick seemed content with her terse explanation at the festival she had waited for him to question her would have welcomed it but no questions were forthcoming the watchwolves seem a bit nervy around you stanrick finally commented breaking the vexed silence magrat laughed and quietly confessed her temptations stanrick snorted in derision weve only ever known mordok to be flesh eaters magrat wasnt sure if this was a tactful question or merely a comment but she chose to interpret it as an opening may i tell you a story stanrick ive never stopped you before he said gruffly when the world was young before there were syndar or humans or ulven and mordok there were our gods solar the god in the sun and lunara the goddess in the moon the world was pristine and untouched the beasts roamed the lands the fish swam the seas and the streams and the birds rode the winds it was beautiful and lonely so lunara gathered the beasts and took the best from them and formed them she wove them with her magic and created them in many colors and shapes but in all she pulled their ears marking them as hers solar breathed life into them giving them motion and put words on their tongues and in their heads these were the firstborn the first syndar the ferals the firstborn began to clamor and run and dance they tried to talk to their mother and their father but they spoke of simple things of living and running and eating they could not understand the lofty doings of their creators the rhythm of the universe was beyond them solar and lunara loved their children but the ferals were just not the children they desired they placed their first children on the earth and let them live as they would next lunara took the elements the basic forces of the world she wove them with her magic gave them shape and form she pulled their ears to show them as her children solar breathed into them their lives and words and set them into motion these were the second born the serous syndar the serous woke with wonder and dignity they adored their mother and father and the world they had shaped they asked many questions of their gods and solar and lunara tried to answer them all but still their children could not quite understand them they were still children solar and lunara placed them down on the earth to live and ask questions of their world as they would this time lunara would work differently she took the best and brightest of her children from among the feral and the serous with her magic she wove her essence into some and solar infused some with his own thus were created the third born the godtouched the celestial syndar the gold skinned and the silver skinned celestials woke to themselves quietly they walked with their parents and spoke of the universe and of life and of death solar and lunara delighted in their brightest children who were able to finally understand them and walk with them but lunara sorrowed for her other children they were unable to speak with them as they could the celestials so she sent down to be born among them some of her favored celestials the celestials would bridge the gap and bring all of their children closer to her and solar thus were all the syndar created and born magrat sighed so you see though we are the firstborn the eldest we ferals are the farthest from our mother and father did you love you mother did you love your father your sisters or brothers we love our mother and father we give them respect and worship but we cannot quite reach them not like our siblings so we chose instead to turn to ourselves we understand each other we could guide and watch over ourselves the first lost the first among my tribe instead of moving on after dying chose to bind themselves to their sons and daughters to their tribe do you know of the syndar practice of reclaiming when a syndar dies their mana the life and breath of solar and lunara is reclaimed it is taken from the body and given back to their families and peoples the lost went a step further we not only reclaim their mana but their spirit mana is ephemeral but the spirit required a physical link so we take of our dead so that they might always find us that they might always guide and watch over us magrat was quiet for a moment do you understand stanrick thought for a moment it is like how we burn are dead so the body can return to gaia and spirit to the great wolf yes i do love my mother and father both have left to join the great wolf i do love my sisters and brothers and most of them too have left yawn and i are all that are left of yoredens pups so in a way i can understand what you say i once asked my father why we leave the mordok to rot and he explained that the corpses become earth and help the trees grow it is the same in death comes life how you bring out that life differs like your skin magrat nodded and it was enough they spent the rest of their watch smoking and watching the stars it was very late when they finally passed the gates of the longfang village no one wanted to spend more time in the wild lands skirting the dirge anymore than they had to the guards quickly shuffled off to the guest hall while she and stanrick headed to the bunks they used when they were in the village she fell asleep quickly even her worry not enough to stave off exhaustion she woke to the touch of one of the seers personal guards he waited silently for her to dress and escorted her to the runeseers tent she knew that this would happen but she had hoped she might have a full nights sleep beforehand he gestured her inside and stayed at his post magrat made her way into the center of the hof quietly the runeseer was quite alone she sat crosslegged under her linen canopy studying a sheath of wrinkled papers in her lap and a mug of steaming tea at hand she gestured to another table with another mug upon it magrat settled herself onto a cushion taking the mug of pineed tea and warming her hands it smelled strong and earthy and comforting she had grown to enjoy it during her time here explain yourself the rune seer said gruffly and without preamble not even looking up magrat took a long sip of her tea gaining a moment to think please bear with me runeseer let me tell you a story as it is told among my people magrat told the same story she had told to stanrick the telling soothed her and she fell into the rhythm and cadence of her peoples lorespeakers when she finished she sighed my kind do not have the same connection with our gods as you do with yours we respect our mother and father but we rely on our own when a syndar dies we reclaim the mana that flows through us and channel it back into the world our communities and families my tribe long ago chose to bind ourselves to our people so that even in death we can watch over our own this requires a physical link and so we take of the flesh so that we can always find our families in this way we are connected back to even the first of the lost the order were long our enemies on mardrun we knew each other well and though we fought and sometimes killed each other we still respected them an honored enemy is almost as good as an honored friend  magrat laughed at herself it is sad that an enemy of my people for a moment was my closest link to them we sometimes honor a respected enemy like we would honor one of our own we honor those who were stronger than us and i owed cedrick for his sacrifice magrats frustration boiled up this is my tribes way of life and the way we honor our ancestors when we came here you required that we respect the beliefs of the ulven and i do but should we be required to follow your faith as well the great wolf does not hear our names i will not give up what i have left to me of my tribe and kin what makes you think the great wolf cannot hear your name the runeseer asked mildly magrat was startled ii am not ulven i wont be standing before him when i die the rune seer sipped at her tea why should you not be able to magrat was confused by this ii dont youve done many great things perhaps if you pray to gaia and change your ways he might hear your name the mordok stand before him perhaps a syndar may as well the runeseer continued seemly oblivious to magrats shock it is expected that you will be punished this cannot be changed you have brought many changes to my pack and will continue to do so i just wish that you might slow down a bit you will be banished magrat caught her breath fear and anger shooting through her the rune seer continued on you will be banished until the snow melts and winter is gone from this land if you survive you will be welcome to return and this matter will be at rest but with all due respect runeseer magrat stuttered but was interrupted the runeseer leaving no room for a word i trust that a winter alone will not be too difficult to a child of the mountains such as you good think about your position here among us while you are gone you had better leave and get packing i expect you to be gone by tomorrow morning magrat stood shocked and confused at this turn of events she wasnt sure what she had expected but certainly not this as she turned the go the runeseer called out to her once more and magrat i expect that i will not be hearing about this matter again do you understand magrat smiled yes runeseer magrat stonily gathered her things considering what she would need or want out in the swamp alone she started at the sound of stanricks voice what are you doing impacking the runeseer has banished me for mytransgressions to think about it and my place within your pack i will be gone until the last of the snow melts she didnt really want to look up after a quick explanation stanrick nodded quietly head east there you will find a clearing the deer are plentiful and the mordok dont go that way often wait here for a moment he left her and returned with a hatchet and a deer skin cloak take this with you you need to come back with the thaw after all you are family now magrat gratefully accepted the gifts and gripped his forearm id better go find yawn and tell him before he does something rash she made her excuse and fled before her goodbye became even more awkward and drawn out she didnt quite dare meet yawns eyes either when she told him so she was doubly surprised when she was suddenly swept up in a bear hug she froze not used to physical contact before gently returning the gesture she had gotten mostly used to the ulven habit of gripping forearms but their hugs still somewhat unnerved her yawn pushed her back gripping her shoulders stay safe stay strong and we will be waiting i will be waiting he turned and walked away leaving magrat behind  magrat watched as the party of longfang left the borders of their packlands  she was not allowed to follow them nor was she allowed to go with them she wanted to go with she had liked being alone a little bit at first she slacked on the training routines the weapons master had set her to cutting wood calmed her made her too tired to dream she spent many hours with her totem conversing and debating eventually the novelty wore off and she was alone again she had debated with her totem on her place within the longfang she knew she was trying to replace her tribe she knew that most ulven would abhor some her peoples religious practices if they knew he had told her that she must stay he knew that she needed people she just didnt know what to do an old guardsman she had once spent an evening drinking with had passed some wisdom to her he said that he always tossed a coin when he had a decision he couldnt make not because he really relied on the random outcome but because in that moment when the coin was in the air you found out what you truly were hoping for as magrat watched the backs of her packmates leaving without her she knew where she wanted to be this story contains the text of the lich emerges with a significant amount of additional information to read just the lich emerges follow the link below the lich emerges  venator looked out at the departing longfang guards the outpost at onsallas was officially under the protection of his vandregonian unit the myrmidons venator felt oddly out of place as the first ever ulven warrior to join a human army he seemed to many the perfect choice to command the first multiracial unit to ever be allowed to garrison the longfang stockade from a political standpoint that may have been true but in his heart of hearts venator felt pangs of guilt and sorrow he wished that william was here among his own people there were few who knew venators story those who did would almost certainly shun him if he were recognized as the oathbreaker venator had been a different person once upon a time both literally and figuratively he had been born the son of a selfish and arrogant chieftain who feared the witchs predictions that his firstborn son would surpass him in his glory venators father had bestowed upon his son the title of oathkeeper at birth and given him away to another pack as part of a political negotiation the boy was trained and indoctrinated from childhood to serve his foster community as a guardian and warder worse even than being given away by his own parents was the fact that his father refused to give him a name and simply called the poor boy oathkeeper the childs resentment bitterness and hatred grew as fast as his skill in combat his uncontrolled rage terrified the peaceful farming community to which he was assigned for he saw his post and his duty as a prisoner sees his sentence he grew up selfish and terrible just like his father one day the mordok burned his village and killed his wards he might have been able to stop it he might have earned great glory he might have died heroically but what was the point what use has the great wolf for a warrior with no name the young warrior returned to the village of his birth he confronted his father and demanded to know his true name now that he was no longer oathkeeper when the chieftain refused and tried to have his son arrested the young man challenged him to an honor duel on the condition that his true name be revealed should he win that duel was the first time that the young warrior was overtaken by the rage of the great wolf he berserked and brutally beat his father to within an inch of his life unable to stop himself even after his name had been revealed his mother tried to intervene and in his blood frenzy he stabbed her her wound proved fatal and venator was forced to flee the village of his birth venator dreadfang left that all behind him as far as he was concerned he had never had a family anyway he embarked on the path of the kyrkogrim but unlike many of the dishonored who go to that pack to seek redemption venator cared only to seek his glory and his death he traveled all across mardrun challenging and defeating all that he came across be they ulven human or syndar every victory surely ringing the ears of the great wolf and fanning the flames of his resentment and revenge eventually though the fires of hatred and anger that had driven him made him weary for they had burned within his chest until there was nothing left to burn he had nothing to fight for and his heart became cold venator fell into a deep depression and began to question whether his victories had any meaning how much did the great wolf really care about personal duels was venator really a warrior or simply a duelist an athlete when venator dreadfang encountered sir william of vandregon he challenged him to a duel venator was more skilled than even the charismatic knight and yet he could not defeat him venators heart was cold and he fought like a machine though precise his rage had mostly abandoned him as had his passion for the fight though he rained blow upon blow on sir william battering him and wounding him grievously the knight refused to yield for the fire within sir williams chest burned hotter and brighter than had ever that of his challenger sir william gained strength and resolve from the presence of his comrades and friends he seemed to get stronger rather than wearier as the fight went on and his men raised the colors of vandregons heraldry upon sticks and sang songs from their homeland venator didnt have any friends he felt the hatred and resentment grow within him he no longer just wanted to embarrass this knight he wanted to kill him as the two clashed venator felt the rage rising inside of him until he neared the flash point of the berserker try as he might however the sparks would not catch for there was nothing left in his heart to burn not even kindling the frenzy never came the two combatants pushed away from each other panting with exhaustion someone threw a waterskin to william who caught it with one hand and sipped it carefully keeping his eyes on venator youve got him william shouted one of the soldiers he may have the fangs of a wolf but youve the heart of a sheepdog venator was parched and dizzy there was no one to throw him a waterskin there was no one to cheer him on there was no one to sing his song or howl his name venators vision flickered in his mind he could see the empty forest and the empty road there was no wolf waiting for him upon that road tis not the right road he muttered suddenly feeling weak he almost dropped his axe whats wrong taunted one of the vandregonians dont have the stomach for it nay said venator tis my heart not my stomach my heart venator realized then that he had found a true warrior whom he could not defeat by the code of the kyrkogrim he was obligated to become protege to that master until he could surpass him on that day venator dreadfang became the first ulven to ever join the army of vandregon it was also the first day he embarked on the path of a true warrior in the coming months and years sir william taught him what it meant to fight for brotherhood patriotism and friendship he transformed a selfish boy into a great and noble warrior and instilled in him the selfless ideals of chivalry that great men live by venator loved sir william as much as he had hated his blood father and for the first time ever he had a family his heart burned for that family it burned for all the right reasons venator dreadfang would die for any one of his myrmidon and the fact that he knew they would do the same for him made him quite possibly the single most dangerous fighter in the army of vandregon now venator was sir williams most trusted lieutenant and here he was on a dangerous and delicate mission on the frontier far from his mentors guidance the watchwolf ambassador raskolf was here as well to observe the operation and help keep the peace but the command of the vandregonian garrison as well as the responsibility for their actions rested squarely on venators shoulders the first day had consisted mainly of setting up camp and performing patrols with some of the adventurers who were more familiar with the area so that the myrmidon could get a feel for the terrain and the trails between echo nightriver magrat farwalker and raskolf vakr the vandregonians were able to get themselves oriented to their area of responsibility rather quickly even raskolfs little daughter elise was knowledgeable of the area and proved to be helpful as a guide venator watched the interaction between the child of seven winters and her doting father he smiled sadly especially when the sole separated from the little girls boot and her father the ambassador voice of the watchwolves warder and champion of the clan high priestess and former warpack leader stripped off his armor and sat down in the dirt back at the outpost to mend it with a sewing kit later on venator was glad that raskolf was there to handle any diplomatic manners that came up he was especially glad that upon his arrival at the outpost earlier that morning raskolf had laid everything out for him his first impression of the watchwolf ambassador was that of a gruff career soldier venators men had been in the process of setting up camp and the longfangs hadnt even left their posts yet but here this grumbling growling old ulven veteran had come storming up to the men of vandregon demanding to see their ranking officer as if the troops had done something wrong when venator stepped forward the ambassador had sized him up and then given a hearty forearm clasp without changing his demeanor at all my name is raskolf vakr he had said i am the voice of the watchwolves and i speak with the authority of the clan if there are any issues that arise between your men and the local ulven you will defer to me and support my every decision are we understood yes ambassador venator dreadfang he continued you are responsible for the security and safety of this outpost and the area surrounding it that includes the roads which have been plagued recently by highwaymen the entire garrison is under your command sir william is a good friend of mine and he has assured me that you are up to this the eyes and ears of the watchwolves will be upon you as will my own and i will be reporting to him a tall man in a red tabard bearing the white lion rampant joined the two he was heavily armored and carried a pack that was bursting with books and scrolls this is cedrick the lion said raskolf he is here to serve as your advisor regarding all matters pertaining to the hungry ghosts one of the reasons that the longfangs agreed to letting vandregon move troops to their territory is because of your armys experience fighting the undead since you yourself however have no experience doing so cedrick will help you he is here to share his wisdom with you listen to him undead have been spotted in the area very recently the ulven ambassador had certainly given a rather gruff first impression and yet now here he was drying his daughters socks by the fire and sewing the sole back onto her boot while he spoiled her with a treat of hot cider and cheese curds hed purchased from the provisioner the little girl finished her snack and suddenly had the need to burn off some energy barefoot or not fortunately the syndar healers dog was happy to oblige and the two began racing around the walls of the stockade venator watched her play for a while the sun was high in the sky and there was not a cloud in sight but it was a bitter cold day for the time of year after lunch venator decided to rotate his guards and take another patrol out the ambassador stayed back this time but cedrik joined the myrmidon along with a few other adventurers the patrol roved out to the east and then cut south they crossed the old bridge and followed the lowlands around the marsh the longfangs had reported seeing undead in this area so the patrol kept a sharp lookout echo nightriver and elise vakr scouted a short distance ahead checking the ground for stability and prodding the mud with sticks to test for quicksand the two had volunteered for the task because they were both small and light they must have appeared easy pickings elise was testing some unstable earth with her feet something her father would have never let her volunteer for had he been along while echo stood lookout with her bow the wind changed direction and the two girls suddenly caught a strange scent in the air it reminded echo of either funeral incense or that awful stinky oil that syndar wore the two turned to rejoin the patrol but a human woman with bright red hair stepped out of the bushes to block their path the woman grinned wickedly and drew two short swords from her belt there was a sudden rustling in the tall grass to either side of the girls but they didnt wait to see what else was about to ambush them echo charged straight at the woman simultaneously and reflexively firing an arrow deep into the bandits abdomen at close range elise was hot on her heels the bandit shrieked and doubled over clutching at her midsection and dropping her swords echo nearly ran the woman over in her escape from the killzone and elises sword flashed out and hamstrung the stuporous bandit for good measure as she ran past the rest of the bandits stomped and splashed through the muck shouting at the two ulven girls as they struggled to keep up echo and elise led them on winding through unstable terrain and losing at least one of the bandits in quicksand smiling to each other the girls ducked and dodged their way back to the patrol snarling and mudsplattered the three remaining bandits crashed through the sixfoot tall swamp grass and reeds stumbling face first into the waiting arms of the heavily armed and armored vandregonian infantry patrol the bandits tried to flee but didnt make it far a quick search of their bodies did nothing to identify them the three men carried with them loot clothing coins and weapons from all manner of different cultures one of them had a bottle of very expensive perfume from tielorrien another carried bundles of freshly cut herbs which elise recognized as the raw components of certain healing compounds her mother favored as the the patrol checked the bodies venator had his men form a perimeter in case there were more bandits and he carefully marked their location on his map as he was putting his map away one of his sentries sounded the alarm that there was movement down in the swamp venators myrmidons crouched low in the tall grass and venator moved to see what the sentry had spied he couldnt believe it as he pulled the grass aside to see he found himself staring out at another tabard of red and gray it was a soldier of vandregon the man was filthy beat up ragged and unarmed but he wore the colors of vandregon and carried on his shoulders another man who was either grievously wounded or dead dressed in the manner of a ranger of vandregon dont shoot the soldier panted im a cleric from the army of vandregon ive got a wounded man here venator and two other myrmidon rushed forward to help him as he stumbled and nearly slipped into a pool of water lilies the wounded ranger groaned as the vandregonians rolled him over and began removing his filthy garments to expose his injuries elise joined them with her little basket of bandages and cedrick readied his prayer beads for healing magic i cant believe it panted the mudcovered cleric falling to his knees and reaching his arms to the sunny sky half a continent away from new hope lost in the swamp hounded by the forces of evil and i find the army of vandregon truly the favor of our maker shines upon us this day the cleric bowed his head in prayer and shuddered as the horrors of his ordeals played out in his head he was physically exhausted cold wet muddy and bloody but such discomfort paled in comparison to the emotion in his eyes what are you doing here asked venator my unit was the only one authorized to enter longfang territory my name is vladimir he said clenching his eyes and his fists i am here on orders from father calder at the temple in new hope we were to reinforce the order of arnath vladimir took a moment to get his composure i am the sole survivor out of a convoy of fifteen we were attacked by zombies two nights ago sole survivor said venator dont be so quick to write off your friend here he was not part of my convoy i found him out here in the swamp the day after i was attacked there was another man with him but he ran away from us to lure a horde of zombies off of our trail the young clerics voice cracked and he punched the soggy earth some of the zombies were my old friends vladimir was a large fellow obviously possessing the strength to match his frame his features however were youthful and despite the terror of his ordeal there was a certain sense of wonder and innocent pride in his tale elise had done her best to tend to the wounded ranger but he was very sick in addition to his injuries she dabbed some cooling salve upon his fever blistered lips and sighed to herself she wasnt sure he would make it and she wished her mother was there with her cedrik the lion knew some basic healing magic but he was nowhere near the healer that anjan ravensmark was as he worked his magic the little girl rolled her eyes you human clerics are slow she said my mother would have had him awake and able to talk within a few minutes cedrik concentrated on what he was doing and ignored the sevenyearold heathens comment its probably because your gods are weak she said my gods are not weak snapped cedrik breaking his concentration and terminating his spell im just more of a fighter than a healer im a lion uhhuh whatever you say mister lion my mother was one of the best fighters on mardrun before she became a healer she was a tundra wolf cedrik gritted his teeth he was beginning to understand what brother captain aeden had meant about these people are you quite finished little girl he snarled youve broken my concentration and caused me to waste precious mana is that all it takes to ruin one of your spells you know let me guess your mother wouldnt have lost her concentration yeah is that what you were going to say well i believe it you know why because she has to put up with you elise wrinkled her nose at him and frowned this man is in bad shape venator said echo nightriver we need to get him back to the outpost we would have to split up then said cedrik shaking his head we need to find the other one that was with him before nightfall venator carefully considered his options he really wished that sir william was there no he said we will not split up if the group of undead in the area was big enough to take out a fifteen man convoy then they are too dangerous for us to face divided they are even bigger now said vladimir shaking his head my fallen friends have swelled their ranks then it is decided said venator we will return to the onsallas outpost and get this man to the syndar healer the other survivor will just have to use his wits to survive until we can find him in the meantime said cedrik we need to focus on preparing the outpost for an attack if the undead are amassing a force of such size we could be in for one wild night  back at the outpost venator gave his troops a chance to eat fill their waterskins and change their socks while he questioned vladimir the ranger they had rescued was very sick he had been bitten by a zombie during his battle with the lichs forces the syndar healer said that she would be able to treat the infection and keep him from turning but it would require a great amount of her resources and she simply wouldnt have enough of the red herb she called phoenix tail left to treat anyone else with injuries later on raskolf and elise left to retrieve healing supplies from the longfang village outside of the swamp and to update the longfangs as to what had been discovered venator was in charge and he had no one to fall back on he figured he should have just enough time to make one more patrol of the area and search for the missing companion of the ranger before the sun horse descended he really wished that sir william was there the final patrol did not locate anyone but they did find some herbs that the syndar healer could use venator got everyone back before night had ascended as they approached the outpost the bittersweet sound of music from faedrun emanated from behind the walls the syndar healer her traveling companion and a third syndar were singing the shiny skinned syndar bard had arrived in the patrols absence she had ruddy yet almost metallic skin the color of beaten copper and plucked a small stringed instrument that seemed to put out more sound than it should have been able to raskolf and elise still were not back and venator wasnt sure if they would try to make the trip through the swamp in the dark he couldnt count on them being back until morning in the meantime said cedrik we need to focus on preparing the outpost for an attack if the undead are amassing a force of such size we could be in for one wild night  venator let his returning patrol have a moment to recover and eat a hearty supper prepared by the human provisioner sorcia before he started coming up with guard rotations the outpost only had one gate to guard which created a convenient choke point for the defenders it was also out in a very open area of the lowlands so anyone posted on the archery platform had an excellent field of vision on all avenues of approach still defending a fortress wasnt exactly something that venator considered himself an expert on other ulven may have been embarrassed to ask a human for advice but venator had been pupil to william for a long time and felt no such shame cedrik he said i need to know how best to defend this place against the undead i have never fought them before but my men say that it is different from fighting any other enemy it is said cedrik the undead have certain strengths and certain weaknesses that are unique to them their strength lies in the fact that they feel no pain and cannot be killed they are relentless in their attack and will continue advancing even if partially dismembered they can eventually be put down if they take enough physical damage but it takes forever their weakness is that they lack mobility they are slow and they are clumsy they are also for the most part very stupid and easy to distract due to their single mindedness being creatures of unholy mana they are vulnerable to divine magic there are cleric spells which can keep them at bay but sadly these spells are limited in their duration and if there is one thing that the dead are good at it is being patient very well said venator since there is no door to the stockade i was thinking we should put our most heavily armored troops in the gateway to form a shield wall i agree said cedrik but i also think we should place the clerics directly behind them the clerics can create divine barriers out to ten feet if things get out of hand the lesser undead will not be able to enter the area of effect and it will push them back a little what about casualties asked venator we will need to have the more lightly armored people in the back ready to grab a hold of any troops that fall in the shield line just like your mordok the zombies will try to drag the fallen out and away from the formation ive seen the wounded nearly torn in half in tugofwars with the undead so the skirmishers in the back will need to look sharp and drag the casualties back behind the line before the undead can get a hold of them venator reflected on these things for a moment thank you for your help he said clasping cedriks forearm i will brief my troops now oh and venator said cedrik as the ulven turned to walk away put me in the front line please as you wish lion  it was very shortly after nightfall the onsallas outpost garrison tried to go about their typical tasks as if everything were normal but in their hearts they all knew what the night would bring grinli the bard sang and played songs from the old world the memories these melodies stirred evoked both feelings of regret and the sadness of mourning what the troops didnt know though was that though the bards music might be sad it also carried with it the power to strip from them all fear within their chests their hearts beat stronger than ever and their frustrations and anger gradually shifted to courageous resolve as the music died down it was replaced by a deathrattle upon the cold autumn wind from the darkness of the swamp came the moaning of many things that should not walk the defenders scrambled and quickly lined up in formation shields at the ready awaiting the enemy charge the charge never came the defenders looked out into the blackness and squinted against the bitter and howling winds it seemed like an eternity had passed the moaning was all around them and the rustle of the slowly shuffling abominations dragging themselves through the tall grass out in the darkness almost gave the impression that they faced an invisible foe sensing that their nerves may break grinli approached the rear of the formation and began to sing and play again as the troops opened their ears to this unusual but pleasant distraction the zombie horde limped into view the battle was a terrible one the defenders were backed into a corner and therefore could not use their mobility to their advantage but they dare not try to engage such numbers in the open or they would surely have been surrounded and dragged down the zombies pressed the gateway hard swinging rusted weapons so blindly and clumsily that they were actually difficult to anticipate or parry fighting the zombies was less like facing an enemy and more like trying to stop an overloaded wagon that was slowly rolling down hill the lesser undead kept advancing even after being impaled on spears and when they did finally fall they crawled and clutched at ankles whenever things got too out of control though the clerics were able to coordinate their divine barriers to temporarily push them back among the zombies was a single undead creature that seemed to stand out echo nightriver directed the defenders attention to it for it seemed to hang back and move with more purpose than the others working its way to the front of the horde finally it raised a bony finger at cedrik the lion braced himself in case it was about to cast a spell but instead it hissed and parted its jaws orrrrrrrrrderrrrrrrr it croaked target that one shouted echo it might be a leader or something temporarily leaving the safety of the gateway the adventurers assigned to skirmisher duty charged out and cut the creature down finishing it off with a blessed weapon and then quickly returned to the safety of the line the zombies continued to press their attack much to the dismay of the defenders well said echo so much for that idea id hoped that maybe killing their leader would have some kind of effect on them its not their leader growled cedrik as he pushed back against the clawing horde of zombies it is just a puppet they are all just puppets rotten meat puppets but that one had some intelligence said venator it talked no said cedrik it was just a puppet just like the others cedrik may have had the heart of a lion but he couldnt bring himself to tell them the truth he knew what that thing was but he was trying so fiercely to deny it that he couldnt tell them he couldnt admit it to himself because deep down inside hed already felt it a spell had been cast after all the careful planning and teamwork of the myrmidon of vandregon the coordination of the clerics divine barriers as well as the daring deeds of the adventurers at the outpost ultimately prevailed for though the zombies threw wave after wave against the outpost the gateway never fell and eventually the undead withdrew venator took accountability of his myrmidon after the enemy had fallen back the troops were in bad shape their armor was damaged and many were wounded to make matters worse there was no blacksmith at the stockade and all the clerics were severely depleted of mana from creating divine barriers during the battle cedrik immediately set up a work detail to burn the bodies of the zombies though many of them were so dismembered that it was unlikely they would reanimate all they could do now was lick their wounds and pray that there was no second wave as the clerics and healers tended to the wounded as best they could venator himself took up a position as a guard relieving one of his men and sending him back within the stockade to get some rest it seemed to him to be the sort of thing that sir william would have done as the makeshift pyres cooled and winked out the color of the night seemed to change it was a cold one and damp everything was blue purple or black in the pale light of lunas fullness the flickering orange of the campfire was the only tone of warmth and venator was too far away to feel the heat like the smoldering tendrils of smoke which twisted upwards into the night sky and dampened the stars venator watched as his breath steamed up in front of his face the wind picked up just a little and he regretted not changing out of his sweaty clothes after the fight from within the stockade the gentle strumming of a stringed instrument carried softly in the night air one by one the soldiers of vandregon recognized the tune and began joining in until even the lips of some of the wounded moved in chorus it was a song from the old world kind friends and companions come join me in rhyme come lift up your voices in chorus with mine let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain for we may and might never all meet here again heres a health to the company and one to my lass let us drink and be merry all out of one glass let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain for we may and might never all meet here again heres a health to the dear lass that i love so well her style and her beauty sure none can excel theres a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee sure theres no one in in this wide world as happy as we our ship lies at harbor shes ready to dock i hope shes safe landed without any shock if ever we should meet again by land or by sea i will always remember your kindness to me i will always remember your kindness to me venators vision blurred the world seemed darker at the same time though the moon shone brighter venator saw movement out of the corner of his eye at first it was just a shadow but then he recognized a silhouette he recognized the gait of the man the way he carried himself and the sound of his boots it was sir william of vandregon venator rose and joined him on the path as he did so the two of them began to march venator wasnt sure where they were going but he would follow his mentor anywhere suddenly the two warriors became aware of movement off to the sides of the road ghostly shadows wisps of darkness the grinding of teeth the flicker of ethereal eyes through trees like the mists of time it was the black pack of the great wolf the wolf road cried venator sir william this is the wolf road a long mournful howl pierced the silence you have led us down the wolf road said venator turning to face his friend william did not answer him instead the knight kept walking towards the howling william stop your kind cannot go to him he will devour you venator found it difficult to keep up soon he was running sir william was still just walking but somehow seemed to get farther and farther away something in the trees began laughing at venator it was a horrible raspy laugh somewhere between that of an old man who smoked too much and the whine of a dog but one of you has to go it hissed it is the key there is only one full moon left venator jostled himself awake his shame at nodding off on guard duty suddenly pushing the details of his dream to the back of his mind if ever we should meet again by land or by sea i will always remember your kindness to me venator dreadfang normally a very hard person to sneak up on was startled when jeremy of vandregons hand suddenly clamped down on his shoulder venator he said cedrick says the ranger is awake go quickly ill take your watch venator hurried back into the stockade cedrick and the syndar healer were tending to him he awoke very suddenly said cedrik he just sat upright and asked about a sword now he is out again the man shivered with fever as the syndar healer dabbed his forehead with a rag her companion approached with a cup of hot water from the fire pit the healer gave her friend some directions to fetch a jar of dried leaves from her luggage and crush them with the mortar and pestle within a few minutes the ingredients had been tied into a cheesecloth and a special tea was brewing this should calm his fits said the healer testing the warmth of the brew with her fingers venator and cedrick helped pull the ranger up to a sitting position and leaned him against some packs and bundles so he wouldnt slump or choke on the tea the syndar healer pressed the cup to her patients lips and administered it carefully making sure that the ranger could swallow on his own we should really change out the poultice over his bite wound but i dont have the materials to make a new one the best i could do for now would be to cover it with a plain bandage until those ulven return with fireroot pineed sap and golden bell leaves i expect them back in the morning said venator just a few more hours aromar mumbled the ranger aromar are they safe do we know his name asked venator vladamir said he thought his name was conner ranger conner said venator my name is venator myrmidon of the army of vandregon you are safe and among friends can you hear me conner opened his eyes and struggled to focus the red and gray he said to himself and a lion of arnaths fist conner tried to sit up but he was too weak the healer steadied him and settled him back against the padding and bundles where is aromar asked conner is he here there is no one by that name here said venator we found you unconscious in the swamp vladamir was carrying you we have to find him said conner if he is lost then it was all for naught he was carrying the blade and the orb settle down said cedrick it will soon be daylight and we will look for survivors again conner shuddered and sighed he tried to get up again and fell back into the pile of luggage ranger said cedrick listen to me i am a lion of the order of arnaths fist we will find what is lost but you have to help us understand what we are looking for you said something about a sword and an orb i dont know exactly slurred conner closing his eyes there are very few of us left on faedrun the whole continent is overrun youre from faedrun exclaimed cedrick even the mightiest fortresses have fallen mumbled the ranger and the grand army of the alliance is shattered we were given a box containing two sacred artifacts which hold great power we were not supposed to know what was inside in case our minds were scryed by the lieutenants of the dark one we sailed east on a small vessel barely suitable for the high sea in order to avoid detection our orders were to find the colony of new hope and deliver the box there along with this message all is lost there is no longer life on faedrun conner shivered and the healer set up some more tea cedrick looked to jeremy and the healer as one they felt their hearts sink it was venator who broke the silence your message has been received soldier can you tell us about the box we would have never even known what was in the box for we were loyal and true to our duty but then we were attacked by pirates when we landed here they killed all but two of us the villains opened the box in front of us set our vessel adrift and took us prisoner they scattered weapons and furs around the landing site to make it look like barbarians did it but our attackers were humans it was months before we escaped we managed to steal back the blade and the brass orb they didnt pursue us we knew they wouldnt the natives in the area surrounding their harbor are hostile barbarians called grimwards that redhaired ladypirate had told us as much probably to discourage us from leaving conner snarled and spat a pox on that shedevil and anyone related to her the stockade fell silent conner said cedrick i am going to get some of my books and come back when the light is better we will try to identify these items of which you speak before we send out another search party this morning in the meantime rest dawn will break soon and i will be back with a map too said venator try to get some sleep jeremy stopped cedrick as he turned to walk away cedrick he whispered do you think he tells the truth is there no longer life on faedrun i dont know replied the lion of arnath i dont know he isnt the first one to say so said grinli stepping into the firelight many have said as much over the last several years but still we cling to hope i see no reason why this should be any different we dont even know if he really is who he says he is said the healer an unmanned ship drifted into new hope earlier this year said venator sir william sent scouts from vandregon to find their landing site further up the coast the scouts ventured to the very limits of friendly territory they reported that there had been a battle just inland of the beach i believe connors story and i think that he was one of the survivors from that ship the others exchanged concerned glances none of that matters right now said venator we have more immediate problems to worry about get some rest it is sure to be a long day tomorrow the sun had not yet completely broken the horizon when raskolf and elise returned with the herbs that the syndar healer needed for conner as well as some basic provisions for sorcia magrat was with them  patrols set out the next morning to find the rangers comrade what they found was not encouraging it was a scene of terrible carnage sticky drying blood stained the tall marsh grasses and flies swarmed all about the gruesome scene something had definitely been killed here most likely by zombies there was almost nothing left but bones and blood all other tissue had been stripped away cedrick crouched down and examined the carnage there were scraps of green cloth i think we found poor aromar he said this looks to me like the it came from a cloak much like conners echo nightriver prodded the tall grass with a stick uncovering a boot caught in a wire snare there was a clear path of freshly broken and trampled swamp grass leading up to it he was running for his life and ran straight into this game trap he must have been exhausted and desperate if he fell prey to such a device it is unlikely that a ranger would stumble into such a crude trap otherwise said vladimir whoever was chasing him approached along these two trails the gait is uneven and something is being dragged perhaps an injured leg said echo undead then for sure nodded vladimir something isnt right said magrat this knapsack has been unbuckled and emptied zombies lack the coordination to do that maybe it was mordok said elise staring wideeyed at the tooth marked bones or said venator those bandits that chased you and echo yesterday are still in the area this could have been their game trap its possible that the undead killed our ranger and the bandits looted the remains earlier this morning when they checked their snares if that is the case said magrat they cannot have gone far we may still be able to track them the patrol made its way down to a well traveled trail magrat and echo were able to determine the heading of their quarry thanks to some nicely preserved footprints in the mud the spacing was normal so the person they were tracking had been walking at a regular pace based on the size of the print and the fact that the toes pointed slightly out they guessed that they were following a tall male most likely human there were other prints on the trail too now but it was hard to determine how old they were as the morning dew had moistened even dried out tracks with fresh pliability the party followed the trail down to the bank of a gently flowing stream there were no footprints in the muddy embankments to either side either they crossed here or they walked up or downstream in the water said echo well never find them now whined elise no said magrat they didnt go down into the water there are no footprints on this side of the stream either look how soft the earth is well said cedrick where are they then they are here whispered magrat we are right on top of them fan out in pairs said venator search every bush brush pile and tree it was elise and echo who flushed the man out of his hiding place he was carrying a spear in one hand and a bundle of red and green herbs in the other the party quickly gave chase as he splashed out across a partially flooded field of short growth plants towards the stand of trees immediately opposite in their enthusiasm the adventurers failed to notice his comrade sneaking out from beneath the roots of the tree near the embankment and heading off in the opposite direction with a suspicious bundle in his arms the lightly equipped bandit nimbly outpaced the more heavily armored vandregonians and cedrick as well but echo elise and magrat were able to better keep up echo and elise chased the bandit down into a draw but magrat took a quick survey of the terrain and noted that the lower ground curved around and took the longer way to a clearing she knew exactly where he was going to come out and where she could head him off as elise and echo pursued the man venator and cedrick yelled at them not to get too close without the rest of the party the two ulven fell back a bit but by the time the others had caught up they had lost sight of their quarry as the draw opened up into grassy wetlands the adventurers had no idea where he had gone elise and echo pouted out in the cattails magrat was quite pleased with herself the thrill of the hunt always took her back to her days on faedrun especially when she was successful she was getting rusty though she hadnt been aiming to kill him when he charged her she had been aiming to take the fight out of him so she could question him no problem she had just the thing for that it was a spell from the old world magrat looked around and listened she wasnt supposed to use it here the ulven didnt like it the others were still pretty far away though she could hear venator and echo bickering about something in the distance as long as she was quick about it no one would ever know whoever said that dead men tell no tales obviously had no knowledge of the divine magic echo had finally stopped pouting and started tracking when magrat popped up from the vegetation and approached the rest of the party he did not have the sword or the orb his brother has them and headed in the opposite direction when we gave this one chase they dont know what they have but they planned to sell the items in new aldoria where is the prisoner asked venator he died from my arrow she said see to the body vladimir said cedrick eyeing the feral syndar suspiciously we dont want one more zombie walking this swamp yes sir vladimir and jeremy pulled the corpse out of the mud by the boots as venator watched thats strange thought the myrmidon to himself shot right in the heart that would have killed him instantly he looked over his shoulder at magrat she avoided eye contact venator looked around at the rest of the party he wasnt really sure what to do they looked disorganized and demoralized what would sir william do he asked himself alright men he said mimicking his mentor with the delivery take five to check your gear and drink some water he didnt really know why but sir william of vandregon used to always tell people to drink water now that he was in command for the first time venator secretly wondered if it was just something that a leader said when they needed some time to think and get things organized just like sir william venator made a point of making sure that everyone actually did drink some water doing so somehow gave him purpose and made him realize what he needed to do he gave the party a few minutes to rest alright now that everyone has had a break lets gear back up magrat says she knows where this bandit is headed and she is going to track him echo and elise will assist echo has some tracking experience and elise has sharp eyes the rest of us will follow behind at a safe enough distance that we dont make too much noise but so that we are close enough to intervene if there is trouble cedrick will set the pace lets move out the party complied without hesitation venator bit his lower lip as he observed them falling into formation maybe he was finally getting the hang of this  an hours march to the west of the stockade the battle brothers of the order had set up a forward camp near the onsallas village they did not want to intrude too deeply into the ulven territory so they had made their own camp brother kanos shouted a young man brother kanos several humans raised their heads or looked around at the sound of the alarmed voice yes what is it replied kanos brother kanos was a broad shouldered man wearing a basic tunic and lion emblazoned tabard of the order of arnaths fist he set down the box of supplies he had been moving and ran towards the messenger brother kanos the eagles bring news the lich has been sighted it is here in the swamp and it is close they are tailing it now yelled the young man finally boomed kanos this hunt comes to a close brothers prepare for battle we move out immediately kanos ran towards his tent and began to don his armor the small camp exploded into action as battle brothers and the volunteer militia of the order prepared for battle a younger man jogged towards the tent his healers robe swishing around him as he went kanos he said why do we move out so quickly we should send eagles to call in the other battle brothers and allies in the nearby settlements cedrick would not want to miss out on this chance now that we are so close it was customary in the order to address each other by the title brother before their name but in this case it was not needed kanos was the older and more experienced brother amongst three siblings cedrick was the middle brother and mahlik the youngest the fact that blood bound them together gave mahlik a bit of leeway outside of the traditional customs of the order such as properly addressing ones superiors or giving them tactical advice brother mahlik we move immediately this has been the first confirmed sighting since the spring and the lich is on the move this is the best opportunity we have to ending it for good i wont lose it by sitting back and letting it slip through my fingers said kanos as a novice helped him strap on his platemail bracers he had already put on his gambeson and chainmail and would soon be covered head to toe in full metal armor brother kanos dont you think it wise to bring all of our battle brothers together for this in case we need them we have yet to get in contact with aeden the masters sent us out here to find him too replied mahlik enough brother said kanos your concerns are valid but i have made my decision without other greater undead or a gravestone powering it the lich will be weak enough that we can end the plague now on mardrun before it has a chance to even truly begin send a message to cedrick and let him know that i will meet you both back here tomorrow evening this ends tonight kanos finished buckling on his platemail breastplate and grabbed his great helm from the stand in his tent even without his armor kanos was a mountain of a man and in full platemail he truly dwarfed most of his fellow battle clerics wait brother i am going with you protested mahlik i am not going to stay in camp while you hunt down the lich brother you know your place is here he said hefting his tower shield you are new to the studies and this fight will be dangerous even if the lich is weakened oversee the camp and prepare for our return we will likely have wounded in need of your skills but that is an order brother mahlik  back in the dirge swamp the adventurers were hot on the tail of the other bandit he was giving them a heck of a chase though taking full advantage of his lighter kit and his knowledge of the area the more heavily armored vandregonians were starting to fall behind he was almost in the clear all he had to do was cross the bridge and cut the ropes behind him and he would be home free by the time they worked their way across hed be to the open pond and paddling his brothers boat out of sight he ran parallel to the stream nearer and nearer to the bridge with every step while the red and gray fell further and further behind he grinned to himself as he jogged along the muddy bank as he gazed out across the field across the way however something was wrong there were ulven on the other side he couldnt cross the bridge was too exposed veering off to the left he desperately sought the concealment of the brambles and hoped he hadnt been spotted he didnt know where to go panic gripped him then as his only plan of escape crumbled before his eyes he was too exhausted to think rationally and his chest burned in the chilly autumn air he took cover in a bush and tried to size up his situation he could see the footmen of vandregon in the distance to the south and he could barely see the ulven further off on the other side of the river to the northwest he pulled his hair and tried to let his thoughts catch up with him his thoughts never caught up with him but the green syndar and the two ulven girls he had forgotten about did finding himself surrounded the bandit drew his short sword and desperately charged the smallest of the girls figuring that she would be the easiest to get past he was wrong elise vakr daughter of raskolf and anjan moved like lightning side stepping his clumsy charge and hamstringing him with her blade as he stumbled by clutching his leg the man begged for mercy but then lunged to grab elise when she knelt to get her healing supplies out arrows from both magrat and echo whizzed by her and dropped him flat on his back where he wheezed his last breath the men of vandregon and the ulven longfang hunting party passed within yelling distance of each other on opposite sides of the stream but neither ever knew as venator and cedrick caught up to the trackers they were greeted by magrat echo and elise had already unwrapped the bundle it contained an ornate sword with an unusual pommel shaped like a lion as well as a large brass orb which had a certain warmth to it despite the chill of autumn that permeated all other things metal this time of year from his studies the night before cedrick recognized immediately what the items were the orb was an activator or key it attuned a magic item to an individual and allowed them to unlock its power the sword was a sacred artifact from the maykar dominion it was a paladin blade what is it asked venator it is a holy weapon from a lost kingdom of the old world it is the bane of the undead and it is the key to our salvation in the face of the lich venator frowned the key you say yes said cedrick both literally and figuratively it is the key a chill ran down venators spine bundling the items back into the blanket roll venator hoisted them over his shoulder come on he said weve a long road ahead of us you want me to carry that offered one of the footmen no said venator i will carry it  raskolf was waiting for the adventurers back at the stockade with conner venator approached the wounded rangers cot and handed the bundle to him conner hugged the sword and the key close to his chest and sighed thank the gods he said but where is venator shook his head im sorry friend aromar is dead vladimir approached his fellow vandregonian and offered to pray with him but conner asked to be left alone raskolf pulled venator and vladimir aside a small hunting party of longfangs had arrived just prior to their return the longfangs had news and it wasnt good the lich had established a gravestone what does it do asked venator the gravestone leeches the life energy from everything around it and stores dark mana for the lich to channel said cedrik with such a blasphemous totem in the area the amount of mana that the lich can draw upon is nearly limitless im afraid that there is more bad news from the longfangs said raskolf the zombies you fought last night were but a small vanguard of the undead army assembled by the lich it grows stronger every day the only thing keeping it from exploding out of control is the fact that my people have always burned the dead rather than bury them so there are no graveyards in these lands for them to draw from this is ominous news indeed said venator what about the blade lion you said that it was the key to our salvation it very well may be said cedrik well said raskolf how does it work thats the problem said cedrick i dont know i dont know how to activate it nor do i know how to channel that kind of power safely the amount of mana that this blade is reputed to be able to pull from the lifestream all at once is astronomical only the paladins of the maykar dominion possessed the knowledge and discipline to master such a powerful divine conduit without destabilizing their own essence speak common cleric grumbled venator he means that channeling upon the power of that artifact would be like getting hit by lightning said vladimir it would likely kill the wielder instantly i see said venator can we use it at all im sorry said cedrick i am more of a warrior than a scholar i am identifying it solely from a sketch in a book i dont even know how to activate it are there any who still do asked vladimir the maykar may be long gone but the independent syndar enclave of the phoenix still exist said cedrick their two cultures shared much with each other before the fall of the dominion and the exodus of the phoenix if anyone would know how perhaps they would chow is on shouted sorcia come and get it while its hot the garrison at onsallas hurried off to get what they could before the longfangs ate all the meat out of the stew and devoured all the butterhorns cedrick pulled out his parchment and charcoal and sat down to eat a bowl of stew and have a well deserved mug of cider he was beginning to draft a letter in his head telling his brothers about his discoveries in the dirge swamp the presence of the gravestone was dire news indeed as he pulled off his boots to pour out the swamp water sorcia approached him with a sealed piece of parchment letter from the hawk service she said postage paid by sender thank you said cedrick meanwhile there was a commotion over by the healers campsite the syndar had been accused of stealing and hiding the artifacts from the ranger after he had dozed off on their cot and then trying to ransom them back to the adventurers steel had been drawn and threats made but raskolf the ulven ambassador had defused the situation cedrick watched from a distance and shook his head as he ate his lunch dipping his bread in the stew he pushed an entire roll into his mouth and broke the wax seal on his letter a few seconds passed and he stopped chewing no no no protested cedrick nearly choking on his bread as he read the message sent from the orders encampment the look of horror on his face was enough to rattle anyone around him he read the words written by his younger brother mahlik that the battle brothers were marching against the lich at that very moment cedrick understood the decision kanos was making the best judgement call based on the information he had but there was one very critical piece that was missing it had just been discovered by the pack longfang hunters of the onsallas village the lich was not weakened from months of being on the run the lich had killed enough people to make a small army and harnessed enough dark mana to create a gravestone the gravestone fed the lich all the dark mana it needed to be at full strength and kanos was marching on it with a small group of battle brothers there was nothing cedrick could do to help it was too late the order was already on the move unless thought cedrick we can interrupt the source of its power his brothers maneuver could create an opportunity for them the lich would respond to the attack and move away from the gravestone it was dangerous but he knew that he could help his brother by attacking the gravestone cedrick grabbed the recently recovered maykar paladins artifacts and ran off to meet with the vandregon soldiers of the garrison and the group of adventurers that had helped retrieve the sacred blade  hold your line brothers roared kanos as the wave of undead slammed into the orders shield wall kanos was in the middle of the line with two other lions at his side the flanks of the wall were made up of more lightly armored starkhaven militia the far flank was held by another fully armored lion so that the discipline of the line would hold even if they took losses the zombies pressed in on the line their stiffly curled hands clawing broken fingernails across the tower shields of the order they groaned and pressed and reached over the shields to grab at the humans but the men of starkhaven maintained their line and held their ground after the initial wave had hit and lost momentum weapons flashed out as swords and hammers crashed down on the undead again and again the steel weapons of the order struck out to chip and grind away at the dark energy that kept each corpse together kanos expected the lich to have zombies guarding him but he didnt expect he would have quite this many the shield wall containing the lions and militia were being pressed hard by horde of zombies about two times their size they were doing well holding the line and even managed to drop a handful of the zombies already kanos knew that most of them would rise again but knocking them down was a sign of progress repeatedly the lionetched warhammer rained down on the bodies in front of his shield smashing aside the zombies and shattering dried bits of flesh from their dessicated bodies kanos glanced to his right and saw two militia members get grappled the sheer number of undead dragging them to the ground one zombie had already sank its teeth into the shoulder and neck of a lightly armored volunteer as he cried out in pain kanos knew it was time brother geshin now yelled kanos as he hammered a zombie in the face and heaved another back with his shield the lion to kanos left dropped back and cast his shield aside to mutter a divine prayer brother geshin finished the prayer by shooting his arms out perpendicular to his body and casting a divine barrier the sudden aura of divine energy pushed the undead on the shield wall back the zombies currently grappling the two fallen militia men reeled in shock as holy energy wracked their forms and they were brutally cut to pieces by the other men of the shield wall as they fell writhing to the ground the lions of the order finished them with blessed weapons and dispelled the dark energy holding the corpses together the bloodied militia men clenched their teeth in pain as they staggered back to resume their positions in the shield wall with the divine barrier giving them some respite the lions began to bless their weapons again or rejuvenate their comrades with divine energy the fight was long from over but the order was prepared for this the lions stepped forward and began to strike at the undead from the safety of the barrier brothers i can maintain the barrier for a bit longgurk started brother geshin before his words were cut short and ended in a gurgled cry kanos spun around to see brother geshin fall to his knees geshins arms faltered as blood gushed out of the smoking hole in the side of his breastplate he wheezed and coughed a voiceless and bloody cry as he dropped the barrier that had been protecting the group brother kanos watched as geshin collapsed lifelessly to the ground clutching at the empty sky behind the fallen lion stood the lich clad in tattered black its hand still extended from casting the death bolt that smote brother geshin flanking the lich were several undead bodyguards these armored undead held weapons and shields and moved with intelligence and speed surpassing the common zombies of the horde knowing they had stepped into a trap was bad enough but after witnessing the sheer power of the lich and his greater undead guards kanos knew that something was wrong the lich was not in a weakened state it must have created a gravestone in the swamp mahlik was right kanos should have listened to him behind us roared kanos as he shifted his tower shield the armored lion holding the left flank stepped in towards the lich and cast a divine spell divine ba was all he managed to say before the lich flicked a wrist out and rammed the cleric in the chest with a magical push the lion flew backwards away from the line and crashed into the zombies on the other side in seconds they were on him several bodies piled on top of the lion and the sheer weight pinned him to the ground teeth broke and rotten fingernails tore upon his platemail the heavy armor would keep him alive for a while but it was only a matter of time before the ravening horde found the chinks in his armor the cleric was unarmed having lost his weapon and shield when he was pushed back the lich stepped in towards the lines kanos charged slamming his warhammer into the creature several times before he too was blasted with a kinetic push that sent him flying backwards rolling and bouncing as he went kanos crashed into the zombie horde his massive figure sending them flying like bowling pins in moments other zombies descended upon him like they did the previous lion and kanos was in a desperate struggle he couldnt see anything except for some part of the inside of his great helm other than the visor he could hear rotting nails screeching on his shield and armor and the grating and wet cracking of broken teeth on the platemail gorget protecting his neck roaring in rage the lion warrior shoved several zombies aside and began to blindly attack with his hammer from the ground every swing landed on his opponents but there were just too many of them just then one of the militia members charged in and tried to clear the zombies away he was brave but his action would cost him his life rotten and withered arms reached out and grabbed him pulling him closer into the mass of undead on top of kanos the lightly armored militia man was dragged down screaming for help until he fell on top of kanos tower shield the zombies tore into the man clawing and biting and tearing his flesh within moments the man was torn to shreds his entrails and blood pouring down onto kanos and his armor all at once like someone had dumped out a bucket at a slaughterhouse while the undead feasted on the mans body on top of kanos the lion continued to struggle to find a way out from the tangled horde he was able to turn to his side and get one arm and one leg under him with every ounce of strength he had kanos roared and power lifted up sending several zombies flying through the air and crashing into the swamp around him he lost his tower shield somewhere under the mass of bodies but there was no time to retrieve it covered in swamp muck and gore kanos fixed his helm and finally got a glimpse of how the fight was going the lion taken to the ground had stopped struggling and had either suffocated or been torn to shreds his body still covered in a mass of undead brother geshin stared into the sky with dead eyes a handful of militia were still standing bloodied and fighting back to back while others struggled on the ground with their attackers several more lay on the ground motionless brother dayson was struggling trying to fight one of the lichs guards and block its attacks he would have been doing well if it were not for the zombie that had grappled his back and was tearing into his exposed shoulder where his armor had been broken open judging by his slow movements brother dayson would soon fall the final lion was maintaining a divine barrier giving the last couple militia time to regroup it was working until the lich stepped forward and blasted a hand sized fist through the lions thigh with a bolt of death and black energy the lion went down in a scream of pain and the undead wasted no time shambling into attacking range they were losing fast and everything that led up to this moment fueled kanos rage he walked forward with a growl and bellowed a prayer to arnath before calling forth the flow of mana i am his shield and his strength i banish you with divine wrath kanos yelled as he pressed his palms out towards the nearest zombie in his way the air rippled with energy as a blast of pure divine power burst out and slammed into the zombie ripping the dark energy from its body and sending it tumbled into a broken mass of flesh some fifteen feet away he stepped past the body and walked quickly towards brother dayson who finally collapsed under the wounds sustained by the lich guards rusty blade a zombie stepped in kanos way but a full on punch to the temple with a plate gauntlet sent the zombie crashing to the ground and kanos never broke stride i am the light in the darkness i banish you with divine wrath kanos yelled again as he pressed his palms out towards the back of the guard it never even saw him as the second divine blast cracked its spine and ripped apart its body the broken lich guard sailed through the air over brother daysons body and crumpled when it landed with the guard fallen there was nothing standing between kanos and his intended target the lich even at full strength a lich would be severely damaged by the pure and raw energy of his gods divine wrath and kanos had enough mana and hatred to pummel it again and hopefully finish the job as kanos stopped close enough for the spell to work he began to call upon the flow of mana the lich turned to face him but it was too late kanos was too close i am a lion of arnaths fist i banish you from this realm with divine wrath kanos yelled as he pushed the energy straight into the lich the blast slammed into its chest and it reeled back several steps shrieking as the dark energy keeping it animated was almost torn completely from its body it was not enough to destroy it outright but the blast wounded it badly knowing it would take more kanos wasted no time in channeling forth more mana not here not again lich for my fallen battle brothers i banish you from this realm with divine wrath roared kanos as he dug deep into his faith and harnessed the raw power of his gods wrath his rage at losing brothers to the lich helped harness the energy and kanos hated the lich with the core fibers of his being in the split second it took kanos to extend his arms towards the lich though a lich guard rushed in and placed its own body in between the lich and kanos instead of releasing his gods wrath into the lich again the lich guards body took the blast at point blank range the attack instantly shattered the corpse destroying it outright and sending it tumbling away kanos stumbled in surprise at what happened and then regained his composure to call upon more mana you will not escape judgement i banish you with div was all kanos could get out as a prismatic blast of energy struck him head on and cut him short the lich had stunned him with a simple rudimentary arcane spell and kanos stumbled backwards clutching his head for what seemed like an eternity the only thing that kanos could comprehend was piercing light and the muffled sounds of all that was around him the sound of the militia being torn limb from limb the gnashing teeth on fresh bloody meat the sword screeching through the plate armor of brother dayson as he was finished off and the slowed beating of kanoss own heart under the effects of the spell during the final dying breaths of a brave few ten seconds can seem like forever when his senses returned to normal kanos opened his eyes to the extended palm of the lich at his chest time returned to normal speed a kinetic blast of energy rammed him in the gut and sent him flying backwards into the dirt he landed with a thud and his great helm was knocked clean off his head with a hacking cough kanos regained his breath and tried to stand the lich walked closer to him and summoned forth blue tinted energy in its hands flicking its wrists forward it assaulted the cleric with bolts of energy that struck him as hard as any forged blade the furious rain of bolts dented and bent his armor and rent his flesh until finally one cracked his breasplate and tore into his stomach blood oozed out of the clerics armor and he knew the wound was deep cedrick mahlik i am sorry i should have listened choked kanos as he looked at the pool of his own blood forming at his feet he was mortally wounded and there was only one thing left to do i pray that you somehow know that i died a good death i am arnaths fist roared kanos as he filled himself with intense rage and charged at the lich completely ignoring his grievous wounds his death was imminent but he would not meet it while on his knees  the adventurers and the men of vandregon moved briskly down the trail to where the gravestone had been spotted by the hunters i fail to understand why you want to bring archers along to fight the undead said venator you said yourself that arrows do them no harm they dont said cedrick but they distract them and get their attention the most important part of a battle plan is maneuverability the undead may be mighty but they are slow moving and even slower witted i think i understand said raskolf if we can control where they go then we should take full advantage of that tell me about this gravestone it is a magical construct designed to store large amounts of dark mana and negative energy the area immediately surrounding it will be so blighted that to merely set foot upon that unholy ground will cause terrible burns and an agonizing death to anyone who gets close how can we destroy it if we cant get near it our divine barrier spells can protect us but that is a stationary spell we cannot move once it is cast said vladimir you will have to leapfrog the spells to get us into range then said raskolf we have three clerics between you magrat and cedrick the divine barrier will also keep the undead guards at bay everyone will need to cluster together in the center of the spells radius we wont all fit said magrat we dont need to said raskolf i want the archers to go just outside of the blighted area and try to draw the zombie guards away with their arrows you will be with us though of course we need your divine magic more than we need your archery the problem is said cedrick that we will waste quite a bit of mana just getting to the gravestone we might not have enough to complete the necessary ritual to destroy the gravestone said magrat it is going to be close i dont see that we have a better plan at the moment once the ritual is complete said cedrick the blight will be lifted from the area but it is likely that we will no longer have any mana to maintain our barriers if there are still undead in the area we will be vulnerable to them that is why the more heavily armed warriors will be inside the circle with you said raskolf we will protect you with shields and spears the gravestone was in the middle of a large clearing surrounded by undead guards the human and ulven archers moved out along the flanks first and seemed to be able to draw a good number of the zombies away from the gravestone with their arrows the clerics wasted no time leapfrogging the core group towards their objective they were about halfway to the stone when a terrible scream pierced the air elise peered out from behind her fathers shield and looked on in horror as one of the archers on the right flank panicked and accidently let herself get chased into the blighted area the woman died a horrible shrieking death as her flesh boiled from her bones and blackened the corrupted earth her death rattle sent a shiver down vladimirs spine and the memory of his caravan being attacked by the undead nearly broke his concentration keep your eyes on the target cleric we must keep moving yelled raskolf dont let yourselves get distracted people as the core group closed with the gravestone they met little resistance occasionally a zombie would throw itself against the outside of the divine barrier swinging a weapon wildly through the outer radius but the little circular shield wall held and protected the casters from the clumsy blows the divine barrier prevented the undead from setting foot close enough to be a real threat the closer the adventurers got to the gravestone however the more undead they encountered and the harder it got to move the amount of force that the undead were placing on the divine barriers with their relentless press began to drain more and more mana from the clerics who became increasingly tired eventually the archers on the flanks could do little to keep the attention of their enemies and the undead all began to converge on the core group as they finally reached the gravestone the horde of undead was relentless in their attack slamming their bodies into the invisible barrier again and again and swinging rusted weapons into the shields of the warriors inside it raskolfs spear flashed out again and again in to the horde and venator parried their blows as fast as he could but the zombies seemed to be reaching further and further into the barrier every second as warriors began to fall within the circle elise worked as fast as she could to bandage their wounds and send them back into the fight they couldnt hold out forever the ritual was taking too long and the clerics defenders were slowly being ground down you people are the slowest clerics i have ever seen snarled raskolf if my mate anjan was here shed have destroyed this thing in about two minutes and then banished all these abominations with rays of sunlight or bolts of lightning by now now i know where the little one gets it from thought cedrick to himself trying not to be distracted by the ulven commentary its cause their gods are weak father said elise parrying a wild swing with her little buckler youd better hope not shouted cedrick as he channeled divine energy into the gravestone because right now my faith is what is cedrick trailed off as he realized for the first time that magrat the feral syndar was the one performing the ritual alongside him and it began to sink in back on faedrun the order and magrats lost syndar tribe had been bitter enemies and their difference in faith was but one of the reasons they went to war yet here they were channeling divine magic together to fight a true evil vladamir shouted venator look out one of the warriors protecting them took a solid blow from a zombie that lunged partially into the barrier and slammed into his shield causing the fighter to stumble back into the cleric who was sent tumbling by the force of the impact vladimir tried to maintain his protective spell as he was knocked over but the divine barrier faltered for just a moment and shifted allowing a single zombie to grab a hold of cedrick and drag him feet first towards the blighted area filthy broken fingernails clutched at the lion and his legs suddenly erupted in pain as though they were being cooked from the inside out and sparks of black and purple energy danced across his armor cedrick screamed in anguish seeing all hope of completing their mission crumbling before his eyes venator reached down deep found the spirit of the wolf within him and let it take hold he frenzied before the zombies could drag cedrick any further out of the faltering barrier the berserk ulven warrior crashed into them and sent them tumbling cedrick took advantage of the distraction to try to get up but his legs didnt work instead he put his arms out and gave the last of his mana to casting a divine barrier strong hands clamped down on his shoulders and under his armpits as the other warriors pulled him back into the center of the group meanwhile venators body appeared to burn with purple fire from the blight as he stormed through the ranks of undead hacking off limbs and trampling them as he raged elise marveled as his eyes glowed with the raw energy of nature and all things wild and somehow the fire of the blight did not consume him whats happening cried elise the berserk rage is a divine gift from the great wolf shouted raskolf it is somehow protecting him but it will not last for long vladimir said cedrick finish the ritual with magrat it is almost done i will hold the barrier vladimir wasted no time taking cedricks place elise watched in horror as the berserk fury left venator and he collapsed in a heap as the light faded and he closed his eyes the blight began to singe his clothing and burn his hair no she screamed no the ritual was almost done but as raskolf looked out for the flanking archers he saw a small groups of zombies feasting upon something in the tall grass then he spotted vandregonian archers in the woodline just to the north of the blighted area they were holding short swords so they must have run out of arrows cedrick was beginning to get very dizzy and his vision was becoming spotty vladimir and magrat read the last line of the ritual from cedricks parchment scroll and the gravestone suddenly cracked asunder spilling whitehot energy from its rune covered surface and erupting dark mana into the heavens in a searing lance of purple and black light the blight was dispelled and the two clerics collapsed unconscious in front of the ruined stone they werent out of the woods yet however they were still surrounded by zombies with wounded and unconscious party members on their hands raskolf croaked cedrick get them out of here ill hold the barrier and keep them distracted im not leaving you then you will have to come back for me there arent enough of you to carry all of us i will stay with him father said elise and tend to his legs we will be safe inside the divine barrier very well said raskolf we will carry the wounded out towards the archers once we have handed them off we will return for you cedrick and retrieve venators body as well the adventurers left the protection of the divine barrier working together to carry the load and moving as quickly as they could to evacuate their wounded and unconscious compatriots some of the zombies started to give chase but lost interest and instead returned to stalk the two people inside the divine barrier one of the zombies seemed to turn its attention to venators body as cedrick stared out in horror he realized that venator wasnt dead the badly burned berserker began to move then tried to get up and weakly stumbled about on his knees groping the earth in front of him as if he couldnt see hes blind and dazed from the blight said cedrick elise tried to call him towards the barrier but he didnt seem to hear her if they didnt do something the ulven warrior would be eaten alive elise said cedrick i need you to run out and get venator you mean bring him back into the barrier right said elise yes ok she said here i go nothing happened she didnt move well said cedrick go im scared cried the little ulven girl elise had grown up fighting mordok and been raised in a warrior culture yet the undead terrified her more than any of the monsters she had ever faced before perhaps it was because these zombies just didnt die no matter how much you threw at them nor did they feel any pain nor did they tire their singlemindedness and relentlessness was so unnatural that it terrified her cedrick struggled as his arms threatened to fall the sheer weight of maintaining so many divine barriers proving to be too much elise its ok they cant hurt us if my arms are up the barrier will hold them back trust me they cant get you you are too fast go over and help venator get back here where it is safe said cedrick through gritted teeth the ulven girl was clearly terrified now that her father wasnt looking over her shoulder venator was stumbling further away from them every second and the zombies were switching their attention to him cedrick had to think of something fast i guess weak gods spawn weak children said cedrick what squeaked elise all this talk about how strong and proud your people are and how great your gods are but here you are cowering under the protection of a foreign god about to let a great ulven hero die a horrible death right in front of you stop it shouted elise maybe your people will write one of those dreadful drinking songs about this shut up shouted elise im not a coward the little ulven girl sheathed her sword picked up her buckler and charged straight out at venator easily dodging the slow and clumsy zombies as she ran cedrick watched in relief as she took venator by the hand and tried to lead him back but something was wrong in his confusion venator was pulling her in the wrong direction and further away from the barrier the zombies were closing in cedricks mind raced had he just sent that little girl to her death he had to think of something cedrick looked down at his mangled legs wounded from the corruption of the gravestone and remembered the revenants curse from the night before he knew then that he was not getting out of there alive he could still do something to help however elise he yelled dont come back this way just take him as far away from here in whatever direction you can elise looked back in horror as cedrick dropped his arms and dispelled his divine barrier hey over here come on face me yelled cedrick the zombies turned to the noise with fresh meat helpless and within reach the undead surrounding cedrick moved in for the kill and the ones pursuing elise and venator abandoned their chase to go after the lion instead as raskolf and the others dragged the wounded farther into the swamp they heard brother cedrick yelling a prayer to his god in defiance as the zombie horde descended upon him raskolf handed over his casualty and ran back towards the sound as fast as he could he was relieved to see elise and venator safely stumbling away from the carnage that was unfolding by the ruined gravestone and he ran to intercept them run straight back to the others he said to elise and venator who was starting to become coherent though his vision was still blurry raskolf wasted no time he charged straight back towards the gory scene near the gravestone and shouted defiantly at the zombies banging his sword against his shield  the lich snarled in disgust at the fallen men of starkhaven the big lion had been more powerful than the master of necromancy had expected he had actually managed to hurt the lich pretty badly fortunately he wasnt terribly clever and the lich was able to defeat him with the most simple and rudimentary of arcane spells stunning someone was much faster to cast then a divine banishment though the lion of arnaths fist had been packing some serious firepower the lich was faster on the draw and had therefore won their showdown the master of necromancy was feeling pretty good about outfoxing these foolish mortals and now his army would grow even larger everything was going according to plan suddenly something was wrong the lich could feel it no it hissed no in the distance a purple and black lance of negative energy and dark mana cut across the horizon and caused the clouds to fork with purple lightning the unholy creature shuddered as the channels linking it to some of its creatures began to falter and entire squads of zombies suddenly lost their purpose and began mindlessly milling about on the battlefield eating each other or trying to get out of the sun so thought the lich clenching its claws with a dusty crackle it is i who have been outfoxed the master of necromancy drew its hood over its skull from deep within the darkened recesses its eyes burned like red stars this was but one battle and there were more to come  raskolf circled back again drawing off the slowly shambling zombies and patiently moving them across the field and away from the body of cedrick like a wolf baiting another creature away from a kill sprinting past them before they could even turn he had almost reached the abandoned body of cedrick the lion when he spotted a girl lying in the tall grass bloodied and unmoving it was elises friend echo nightriver she was still alive but barely hoisting her slender frame up on his shoulder she whimpered as he continued running and the impact of his every step jostled her body they reached the place where cedrick had fallen there wasnt much left raskolf retrieved the artifacts but the body was no longer in a solid enough state for him to carry even if he hadnt already found echo we will return for you brother cedrick he said thank you for your noble sacrifice thank you for saving my daughter raskolf didnt believe in taking things from the dead but that taboo was one of the things that had gotten them into trouble when the lich first appeared on mardrun he wasnt going to keep the blade or the orb either he just needed to return them to the humans  the moon was still full that night magrat stared silently down upon the man she had known for only a few days his body was torn and sprawled the white lion on his chest spattered with blood that it should come to this the longfang had become a second home to her but they could never replace her tribe her family that this human should be her closest link to her people it would be hilarious if it wasnt so damn depressing though she was exhausted from the breaking of the gravestone and and the healing of the ulven girl she had work to do and could not rest as silently as she could she gathered the dead human and his belongings and laid him on a hasty but servicable pyre she bowed her head over him and chanted quietly invocking the spirits of the land and his ancestors to guide him on his final journey she prayed for the man whose order had been her peoples enemies for far longer than she had been alive spirits grant this man honor guide his feet as he journeys home tell him we honor him for an honoured enemy is as good as an honoured friend she took up her ritual knife and took some of him taking some of his strength and power into herself she took his lions tabard torn and bloody before setting the pyre ablaze it might attract the mordok or any zombies remaining in the area but cedrick would not return and was laid to rest it would take the messenger a few days to find the nearest order group the package contained cedricks tabard and a message carefully written with the help of some of the more formally educated at the outpost at the bottom of the message was a small note we honored him as we did in the past and set him on his pyre signed was a sigil of the lost and she hoped that there would still be a veteran among their number who remembered how the lost honoured their dead a grave insult and a grave honor all at once  it had been four days brother mahlik  asked one of the orders camp followers from the tent opening yes said mahlik from the small portable desk in his tent mahlik had taken to studying scrolls and texts to busy his mind and he had a number of them opened and held down by rocks he was reading by candlelight since it was well into the evening his brothers should be back by now he knew it even if he refused to admit it the others are worried that if the mordok attack now we will not be able to stop them we are near onsallas but not close enough to be protected by our ulven allies said the worker uncomfortably mahlik knew that he should not have waited this long and that to stay any longer was endangering everyone left in the camp he could not shake the feeling that if he gave in and stopped waiting for their return that it would finally make it real to give up and leave would admit that his brothers were dead youre right we have waited long enough start taking down the camp we will move to the outpost in the morning and link up with allies or other order members there said mahlik the worker nodded and left mahlik set down the scroll he was pretending to read and stared blankly into the flickering light of the candles lost in his inner thoughtsspring year 261 inside the hall of haygreth grimward a young daughter of gaia worked desperately to heal the warriors of her clan a girl of only sixteen summers her blood encrusted hands shook and her stomach turned but she managed to maintain her composure in the face of such horrors though tears ran down her cheeks and her heart pounded within her chest still she kept death at bay with her magic a truce had been called to gather the dead and tend the wounded as she worked the girl saw two warriors pull a boy out from underneath an overturned table one of the warriors slung the skinny body over his shoulder like a side of meat its youthful features permanently frozen in a mask of fear pain and death he looked to be about the same age as the girl herself there are more wounded being brought in said the high priestess now that they have cleared that body go flip that table back so we can lay someone upon it the novice healer nodded silently her jaw still agape at the sight of the dead boy as she struggled with all her might to flip the heavy banquet table by herself she was startled to find that the upside down table had concealed a pile of human entrails she gasped and nearly dropped the table on her own feet having just learned to read entrails she was horrified not by the gut pile itself but rather what it spelled out what are you staring at snapped the old crone as she crutched over to see nothing muttered the girl kicking the entrails into a jumbled mess nothing at all high priestess well get that table cleaned off and do it quickly theyre bringing in your cousin shes been terribly wounded in an honor duel eight months later wargah grimward and her younger cousin alvi watched from the shadows what the two ulven were doing was certainly treason there was no one else to turn to though haygreth grimward wargahs father hadnt been the same since he had made his declaration of war hed been locking himself away and the only person he really seemed to have time for was the old blackwing high priestess on the few occasions where wargah had been able to speak with him he seemed not only distant but almost confused he had the weary unsteady look of a warrior who had seen too much and always seemed to be focusing on something behind the person he was talking to he had given much of his authority to khulgar graytide and to corvo blackwing the high priestesss son wargah grimward had lost her status as a pack leader to corvo following the honor duel against that watchwolf she had been branded with runes of shame and cowardice even her closest friends shunned her she was secretly afraid that her fathers condition was her fault but after her cousin had revealed the terrible secret read in that longfang boys entrails she doubted it was that simple well she said to her cousin alvi im going to approach them they might kill me if they do try to stay hidden wargah raised her hood to protect her head from the cold of night after the ritualistic shaving and branding following that honor duel her hair was beginning to come in again but she still found that her head was always cold wargah rose to her full height and moved out into the path of the travelers look sharp rasped ylsa there is someone on the path ahead of us the column began to reform as its captains called it to a halt the longfangs and watchwolves at the front of the formation began interlocking shields while the men of vandregon broke into two groups facing either flank it could be an ambush growled the leader william venator get off the trail clear the danger area by at least fivehundred paces to the west then set up a perimeter protect the clerics and the phoenix right flank march wargah grimward stared at the unblinking wall in front of her not a single shield or spear wavered in the slightest they could have been statues but for the billowing and flapping of their cloaks and furs in the winter wind and the occasional jet of steamy breath in the moonlight alvi watched from the shadows and tried not to make any noise as she cried she was certain that she was about to see her cousin die there were already longfang scouts sneaking up behind her in fact dont move a muscle girl whispered ylsa to alvi running the flat of her short sword across the terrified grimwards chin and dont make a sound alvi tried to throw up as quietly as she could on the trail wargahs teeth chattered as she struggled to steel her resolve she hoped her voice wouldnt break im from clan grimward and i have come alone i have a message for your leader alone huh shouted ylsa dragging alvi to her feet by her hood and causing the poor girl to shriek and squeal in terror as she clawed at the drawstring that tightened on her neck then i suppose you dont know this girl wargah heard the creak of a cold bow being drawn off to her left she froze this couldnt get any worse if you have a message from clan grimward then you can tell it to me growled a familiar voice as a figure pushed its way to the front of the shield wall i am raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolves it had just gotten worse identify yourself grimward messenger he snarled wargah swallowed hard clenched her fists for a moment and took a deep breath wargah she said wargah grimward daughter of clanleader haygreth grimward raskolf shuddered and cracked his knuckles in the cold air as wargah threw back her hood i came here to warn you she said forgetting completely what she had rehearsed in her head when she pictured herself meeting with anyone but him i came here to warn you that you are being hunted as we speak and to deliver this young daughter of gaia novice to you she has seen things which confirm the portents your high priestess spoke of ylsa said raskolf bring that prisoner to the rear of the formation is there anyone else out there no raskolf just these two no signs of anyone traveling with them excellent work alvi was rudely deposited at the feet of a large heavily armored warrior he bared his teeth his fangs were unusually long alvis mind raced the big longfang leaned down over her cowering form and wrinkled his nose he started sniffing her and narrowed his eyes standing back to his full height he unclasped his fur cloak and set it down other warriors had gathered around and were watching the big man began gesturing with his hands at his chest as if he were pantomiming the removal of a garment alvi froze and her heart skipped a beat the warrior began growling and making inhuman sounds as he gestured furiously motioning as if tugging at his chest alvi completely lost all composure and began sobbing hysterically she wondered how many of them would take a turn at her body before it was over and whether or not they would kill her when they were done powerful hands clamped down on her shoulders and unclasped her cloak slowly pulling it away alvi clenched her eyes and shivered there was suddenly a heavy weight on her shoulders and she was very warm she heard heavy footsteps walking away and realized that she was wearing the longfangs fur cloak a heavyset warrior with a scraggly beard glanced over his shoulder at her whats your name asked yawn alvi she stuttered tears running down her face you look like veera he said a stones throw away harlok longfang knelt down opened his waterskin and started scrubbing the vomit off of alvis cloak and onto a mosscovered rock it had been so long that hed forgotten what his sister looked like at least hed forgotten what she looked like before the mordok had got through with her hed never be able to forget that image now as he knelt and scrubbed the grimwards cloak the corners of his mouth turned up into a smile a pleasant memory suddenly returned to him and he closed his eyes across from him crouching in the river was his big sister veera smiling and splashing him as they did their mothers laundry together beneath his helmet harloks eyes watered just the slightest bit but no one saw besides it wasnt a tear it was just a drop of water from the stream raskolf had broken away from the formation to meet wargah in the middle of the trail there were at least three arrows drawn on her she tried to be brave but was discovering just how much harder that was without her pack flanking her she couldnt believe the rage in the watchwolfs eyes and was beginning to wonder exactly what his relationship was to that woman shed killed youve given me no reason to trust you wargah my mission is too important to be sidetracked with your trickery ambassador she said swallowing her pride and kneeling in submission i swear to you that i am telling the truth i swear on the honor of raskolf struck her with the back of his hand so hard that she stumbled onto her back you dare speak of honor after the treachery that you have done raskolf drew his sword look at you even your own kind cannot trust you and they have branded you to warn the rest of the world not to trust you go ahead she cried pulling back her cloak to expose her neck go ahead and do it it is within your right to put me out of my misery i have nothing to hide i have been dishonored i have had everything taken from me even my pack i am already broken and here i lie defeated you know what that is like raskolf wargah saw nothing but blackness flashes of red and then as her vision came back branches reaching up into the spinning starry sky there was something wrong with her jaw it didnt even hurt it was just wrong it felt almost as if it wasnt there at all she couldnt move the lower half of her face at all her neck and chest were hot and wet dont ever compare yourself to me you wretched creature shouted raskolf you are a coward you didnt lose your honor you never had any wargah tried to respond with something but her face didnt work and all that came out were pitiful and wet noises raskolf had kicked her so hard that he had broken her jaw rhodi shouted raskolf come here give me your hammer brother said rhodi you need to calm down just give me your hammer no raskolf we dont kill messengers im not going to kill her yelled raskolf im going to break her legs and send her slithering back to her father like the viper she is raskolf tried to grab the hammer from his brother but was unable to wrench it from the blacksmiths grasp are you done brother growled rhodi your daughter is watching elise had squirmed up to the front of the shield wall and was peeking out her eyes were huge and wet anjan has faith in you raskolf growled rhodi so did imglyf you are an ambassador now whether you like it or not life will never be as simple as it was when we were soldiers you are the voice of the watchwolves what of those words you spoke in the longhouse of grimward did you not really believe them were you just saying them raskolf looked toward the shield wall the eyes of the watchwolves were upon him as were those of the nightrivers and the longfangs humans and syndar had moved up to witness the brutal scene between raskolf and wargah william and venator of vandregon broke ranks and approached raskolf raskolf venator said revenge can never satisfy it is a thirst that makes fools of us for much of my life i searched for my father eager to pour his blood like wine from a cask that thirst consumed my heart like the desire of a drunkard and caused me to leave naught but pain and regret in my wake are you calling me a drunk raskolf growled im saying that you are not in control of yourself right now you need to sober up or step down venator snorted the two ulven locked eyes in a staredown and then who is going to lead this mission raskolf asked baring his fangs i will exclaimed william stepping between the two and pushing them apart his voice lowered to a whisper i will if need be raskolf father aegeus believed in this look around you look at how far we have come we have gathered an army it is an army of ulven syndar and humans who would have believed it possible we have done it you have done it you were integral to it raskolf suddenly looked away he felt ashamed father aegeus told me something before he left for the peace summit raskolf he told me that when called to lead not everyone would have the stomach for it you do youve proven it before we never would have gotten this far without you father aegeus believed that we could have peace with the grimwards if not today raskolf then perhaps someday yet we cannot let our emotions get the best of us our mission tonight is too important once the lich is out of the way and the undead threat purged from these lands then we can focus on the war with clan grimward and ending it one way or another it was silent for a few moments save the wind in the trees and the rustling of dried leaves in early winter you speak the truth my friends raskolf sighed i am sorry once again i have failed to recognize my duty before my pride and my hatred raskolf noticed that elise had crept up on them she was about halfway between them and the formation her hand was to her ear as though she was straining to eavesdrop on their quiet conversation now that raskolf was done yelling at rhodi raskolf ignored her raskolf whispered william we all have our moments of doubt believe me i know but a wise man told me that no matter how hopeless it seemed men like us must not crumble being a military leader is not so different from being a man of the cloth our men must have faith in us raskolf vakr voice of the watchwolves what are you talking about father squeaked elise raskolf looked into the eyes of william then venator rhodi placed a hand upon raskolfs shoulder and nodded knowingly were just coming up with a plan elise said raskolf we have to split our forces now and figure out what to do with the prisoners go back by drifa yes father what now raskolf asked venator i will address the troops and we will come up with a plan raskolf turned to face the troops rhodi he said put the prisoner in custody of the longfangs let her accomplice tend to her injury then call the army to attention in a block formation order of march on the trail but facing the east as rhodi called all elements back into formation raskolf thanked william and venator then sent them to rejoin the men of vandregon in less than a minute the entire army was back in formation and ready to march rhodi bellowed a facing movement and the entire army turned to the east as their element leaders and captains echoed the command guidons were brought to attention and raskolf began to walk the length of the formation i meant what i said in the longhouse of haygreth grimward he shouted i tried to stop the future from coming to pass i tried to beat the portents but now despite our efforts the undead are here and now despite our efforts we are at war with the grimward clan we face conflict on two fronts i thought that i had failed you perhaps some might say that i have but now that i look at this assemblage i realize that our cause has not failed i see you all standing here shoulder to shoulder ulven human and syndar i see ulven in the ranks of vandregon i see a syndar in an ulven pack even if i have failed you it matters not the fate of this land never rested upon my shoulders to begin with it rests upon yours as you stand together as brothers and sisters this coalition may be our last hope to defeat the lich and his army as i look upon you i no longer see ulven or syndar or humans i see the army of the free peoples of the eastern continent that is the beacon that is the shining and guiding light in this our darkest hour let us make it into our greatest triumph the most hopeless battles make for the best songs anyhow warriors of mardrun are you with me a hearty cheer went up from amongst the assemblage rhodi leaned on his hammer and smiled he called the troops to attention and reformed the blocks so that they were facing the direction of march as the noise died down raskolf signaled for the captains of all the factions to approach him we have word from these prisoners that a warpack from clan grimward is hunting this army as we speak ill take my watchwolves of luna and the longfangs with me to confront them we will do whatever we can to stall them once youve destroyed the lich retreat north into watchwolf territory drifa and elise will show you the way no matter what happens to us dont look back and dont try to find us accomplish your mission and then fall back into friendly territory the seasoned veterans of vandregon nightriver the order of arnath and house phoenix shared knowing glances and then took turns clasping forearms within the hour we purge the undead from these lands shouted william it ends tonight a cheer rang out over the assemblage yes whispered venator to himself it all ends tonight greki and ozvolt searched the village of ulslog on the red squirrel river the two graytide warriors had been sent in as scouts the rest of the warpack had formed a perimeter around the small fishing hamlet it sure is getting dark early isnt it friend said ozvolt aye said greki the village was strangely quiet and totally dark not a single fire or lantern burned save the torches carried by the two warriors and the only sound was the crunch of their boots upon the cold earth normally they would have been greeted by guards or perhaps even laughing children if the sun wasnt too low in the sky lycon and corvo had sent the two scouts ahead when the warpack approached the village and realized that all the chimneys were smokeless not even a dog to bark at us friend muttered ozvolt aye the two warriors continued their search of the village there was not a soul to be found the huts and outlying buildings all seemed to be intact food had been left on tables and items of wealth left out in the open if this was a raid my friend the traitors would have taken the food and treasure said ozvolt aye eventually they made their way to the longhouse of the village chieftain unlike the other buildings the great hall had been severely damaged as though besieged the great doors were smashed to pieces and had been pushed into the entryway ozvolt looked to greki watch my back friend he whispered aye said greki ozvolt drew one of his throwing axes and placed it in his left hand behind his shield with his right hand he extended the torch into the doorway and stepped quietly over the wreckage of wood and iron shadow danced and leapt about the room as if evil spirits were diving for cover from the torchlight solid oaken tables looked to have been piled up against the front doors as a barricade but had been pushed back by some terrible strength leaving ruts in the floor the tangle of overturned furniture made movement difficult and the two warriors tripped and stumbled as if the very shadows themselves clutched at their ankles i dont like this whispered ozvolt if we get much farther in i fear we will become entrapped in this maze of furniture aye said greki the great hall opened up once the two warriors were clear of the barricades as the light of their torches illuminated the hall the warriors decided very quickly that they had seen enough and stumbled back the way they had come as fast as they could we have to report this to lycon panted ozvolt aye said greki  lycon graytide and corvo blackwing had moved to higher ground and now looked down into the valley below they had sent scouts in to search the village and confirm it but both were pretty sure that something very bad had happened there not a single chimney smoked and every window was dark lycon graytide the onearmed veteran may have been past his prime but no one would ever say that to his face he was strong despite his disability and quick to anger after the loss of his arm he had resigned his leadership of the graytides to khulgar but he was still a fierce and respected elder khulgar was difficult to train it had taken years before the veteran felt that anything hed taught the headstrong warrior was sticking corvo blackwing however was different he soaked up information like a sponge not only that but he possessed a certain vigilance that lycon had never been able to instill in khulgar he had an analytical mind too that lycon wished to groom it wasnt something that lycon had ever possessed himself but he recognized it and hoped to exercise it maybe the village was attacked and they had to abandon it what do you think corvo said lycon it would seem an obvious conclusion but at the same time it doesnt make sense said corvo the gates are open if they were under attack wouldnt they have closed their walls not if they ran away maybe there was no time it could have been a surprise attack true lycon said corvo it could have been a surprise attack in any case though i dont think anyone escaped why is that asked lycon their canoes are all still sitting on the riverbank lycon cleared his throat and fidgeted he had missed that i was trying to be optimistic he grunted my mate grew up in this village do you like your inlaws asked corvo not really sighed lycon well said corvo even if there is no room for optimism you can still look on the bright side i beg your pardon exclaimed lycon you wont have to visit them anymore dont be so irreverent corvo said lycon this is serious of course of course forgive me lycon it was quiet for a moment save the cawing of crows lycon couldnt really fault corvos attempts at levity at least he had a sense of humor unlike khulgar my woman is never going to let me hear the end of this groaned lycon why asked corvo it isnt your fault yes it is i should have known it was happening and stopped it dont be ridiculous thats impossible doesnt matter said lycon ill still get blamed for it and shell never let me forget how i didnt save her parents i dont understand said corvo you wouldnt youre single mentor and protege smirked at each other and then started laughing out loud well lycon said corvo i hope to change that soon oh right laughed lycon haygreths niece velma her name is alvi said corvo and i think i have her attention although i must confess that i am a little disheartened that she didnt see me off when we left i couldnt find her anywhere either im sure youll get her attention even if it means that your mother has to brew a love potion for you shhh snickered corvo dont tell anyone the two chuckled a bit before falling silent in all seriousness though elder lycon he said unstoppering his waterskin will you really get blamed for this if i do ill just blame khulgar corvos eyes widened as he choked on his water lycon howled with laughter and slapped him on his back making the coughing fit even worse what in the name of gaias saggy tits are two laughing at snarled khulgar graytide as he stormed up the hill nothing mother grinned lycon who was probably the only person who dared to ever make fun of the packleader to his face well im glad that you think the loss of one of our villages is so damned funny the wind picked up there was a flurry of activity below as two figures sprinted out of the village and back towards the perimeter as fast as they could looks like we are about to get some answers lycon coughed corvo wed better head back down said lycon squinting his eyes as he sniffed the early winter air the three warriors began making their way back down into the valley hey lycon asked khulgar didnt your inlaws live here the other two warriors suddenly burst into obnoxious laughter khulgars face twisted in confusion to their reaction he growled unintelligibly and hurried ahead to greet the scouts leaving corvo to help the onearmed elder down the hill by himself  lycon and corvo stared at the bloodied walls of the longhouse what does it say grunted lycon who like most ulven couldnt read corvo silently put the words together in his head i dont know he said i cant read it well said lycon lets call khulgar in maybe he can give it a try no said corvo no khulgar wont be able to read it if i cant dont bother very well said lycon what do you propose we do then we will come back later with my mother she will be able to read this it is magic khulgar had just moved the rest of the troops into the village it was dark now he consulted the daughter of gaia and asked her to commune for answers he then spoke with his best trackers and began analyzing the village it was clean it wasnt ransacked the only building that was damaged was the chieftains longhouse the trackers reported that an army had passed right by the village but did not appear to have entered there were however signs of a mass exodus of the population which left a lot of blood in their trail and then either joined preceded or followed the army outside of the valley if the population had fled they had done so on foot rather than take their boats a theory was forming in khulgars mind he was beginning to wonder if perhaps the humans had attacked from the river it wouldnt be the first time packleader said the daughter of gaia raising her chin high but keeping her voice low the bones hint that it was an act of compassion that betrayed these people i know nothing more bbut i think the hungry ghosts have been here there was something weird about the way she was talking her speech was strange and disjointed khulgar raised an eyebrow hed known this young woman since she was a child i ddont know why iwe think so she stuttered and iii cannot be certain but we just feel it thank you said khulgar are you alright yyes khulgar hesitated for a moment growing up in a world where magic and reality intersected bred two types of people some embraced magic others feared or distrusted it khulgar had always been one of the latter he was about to turn away from the daughter when she suddenly grabbed his arm she had a strange and distant look in her eye it unsettled him she started breathing heavily her breathing got faster and faster and she began crushing khulgars arm with her grip the daughters neck bent and she arched her back khulgar tried to break away from her but she held him fast an unearthly rattling croaking sound boiled forth from her throat and gasping mouth her chest heaved and she fell to the ground in a full body seizure grimward warriors scattered and ran for cover everyone had heard tales of spellcasters reaching critical mass and exploding old wives tales of course but then that phrase carries different meaning in a world of magic where the dominant intelligent society is rather matriarchal in structure the most powerful spell casters on mardrun were for the most part old wives themselves the daughter didnt explode this time but she did bleed from the ears nose and mouth khulgar had made up his mind this was an evil place and everyone who lived here was dead he was just ordering his troops to put the place to the torch when lycon and corvo intervened their argument would have lasted longer but for the timely return of a small grimward scouting pack a combined warpack of longfangs and watchwolves was just minutes away khulgars pack was mobilized and heading down the trail in less than thirty seconds they would have to burn it later  when ylsa dria and azra came sprinting back they had company close behind the three scouts rapidly made their way up the narrow pass and rejoined the ranks a few of the more eager grimwards made the mistake of trying to follow them through the narrow stone corridor and suddenly found themselves face to face with the enemy in an enclosed space their panicked retreat back to their own ranks was funny to watch but brought no laughter from the watchwolves raskolf had positioned them in the best place he could find there was a narrow avenue of approach where the grimwards would have trouble moving large numbers of troops at once yet the defenders had a decent enough escape route along a ridge and down into a draw should they be forced to flee raskolf had figured that they would be outnumbered though he didnt know how badly his scouts had reported an estimate to him upon their return it was worse than three to one raskolf wasnt surprised he figured that this army was intended to engage the combined ulven human and syndar force that he had just split raskolf made his way to the front of the formation to parley if he couldnt slow them down with words the watchwolves and longfangs would be sure to make one heck of a speed bump the thing with speed bumps though is that inevitably they get run over khulgar berated his younger warriors as they stumbled down the narrow pass fools he bellowed they had you dead to rights youre only alive because they let you run lycon caught one by the collar and snarled in his face spinning the terrified novice around his laughter boomed through the rocky terrain the great wolf doesnt remember those who died of stupidity he cackled khulgar and lycon pushed their way to the front three figures had left the enemy ranks and stood at the chokepoint its going to be a bloodbath getting them out of there grumbled lycon not if we can flank them whispered corvo that isnt going to work we cant get along side them or behind them there is no room to maneuver said khulgar of course there is said corvo its just a really long walk we dont have time growled khulgar sure we do they want to talk see khulgar was about to protest further but corvo was already running back through the ranks dont worry said lycon youll be fine ill go keep an eye on corvo and make sure he doesnt get lost khulgar curled his lip at the onearmed elder the graytide packleader grabbed a couple of guards and set off to talk with the enemy now he thought to himself all i have to do is kill some time here comes khulgar graytide said rhodi great said raskolf now thought raskolf to himself all i have to do is kill some time raskolf stood in the middle flanked by rhodi and stanrick stanrick was trying to fix his helmet it had been damaged earlier when he made a comment about harlok finally having someone to talk with now that wargah was traveling with them lycon and that other warrior fell back and took some troops with them whispered raskolf to stanrick they must know another way to get up here i want the longfangs to take the prisoners and fall back before we get flanked ambassador the longfangs arent going to abandon just go stanrick you arent my bodyguard anymore a good number of the watchwolves of luna are here if we die tonight i need the longfangs to not only deliver the prisoners but to help protect our borders i thought perhaps we could use those prisoners as leverage but things are going to get ugly i can feel it then you should go ambassador and the longfangs will hold here just go damnit growled raskolf its my turn to hold and your turn to get the important people out of here khulgar was almost within earshot raskolf hissed stanrick be gone from my sight shouted raskolf as he wound up and backhanded stanrick osvolt and greki khulgars bodyguards moved their hands to their steel and stepped in front of him such a dastardly and treacherous plot i would have no part in you cur they heard raskolf shout at one of his guards stanrick was confused he was also blind as his broken helmet had been spun about he stumbled back towards the ranks ill not have the likes of thee stand at my side under a flag of truce and ill never trust you to stand behind me either khulgar has come to us to parley and my watchwolves will certainly respect that i dont need you or your clanless pack khulgar stood frozen in place behind his guards stanrick pulled off his helmet and threw it at yawn from within the ranks of the watchwolves and longfangs there was quite the commotion raskolf and khulgar approached each other khulgar graytide said raskolf raskolf vakr said khulgar the two silently stared at each other for a while sure is getting dark earlier said osvolt to rhodi it is the will of the sun and the moon replied rhodi my people keep track of that sort of thing aye said greki the winter months favor the moon said rhodi and her favored children the darkness gives us the advantage no one said anything behind raskolf and rhodi the longfangs were beginning to fall out of the formation khulgar raskolf finally said this is the point where you tell us that we are trespassing on your land and make some demands i thought that you werent supposed to lead warpacks anymore raskolf replied khulgar im not im an ambassador now im supposed to be making peace and yet said khulgar here you stand in front of a warpack slapping warriors and yelling insults at them thats right said rhodi im the brilliant military leader im here to give you a fight care for a drink rhodi unstoppered a drink and took a swig before offering it to greki greki accepted it despite khulgars gestures to the contrary his eyes widened and he coughed a few times see said rhodi right in the liver aye enough of this foolishness growled khulgar im not here to play your games im not playing games khulgar said raskolf im only in your territory because we followed the hungry ghosts here im not falling for your tricks again raskolf it isnt a trick yes we are here looking for a fight but no it is not with you your silver tongue will get you nowhere with these ears raskolf you have given me no reason to trust you in the past i trusted you with not only my life but my honor and where has it gotten me i delivered your words to these humans you love so much they spit on me slapped me mocked me and chased me from a place where i was forbidden to draw a weapon upon them to defend myself i was publicly humiliated because i trusted you and your priestess they dont want peace to even try to make peace with those savages was folly i should have known better treaties and papers cannot protect us they didnt protect my mate they didnt protect her clan and they will not protect my people either we shouldnt even be playing their political games anyway this is our land not theirs khulgar i swear to you that i never meant for that to happen to you oh you didnt just like you didnt mean to lead the tundra wolves into that ambush just like you didnt mean to start a civil war i didnt start this war growled raskolf sure you did sneered khulgar your words were the spark that lit the fire and you made me deliver them you coward i even believed them myself for a while youre just that damn good i guess raskolf even after all the times we fought together and all the times youve let me down i still let you fool me into thinking that we would be on the same side when this war started i dont know how i could have been so blind but now that my eyes can see im glad that its all out in the open now we are enemies we shouldnt be fighting we shouldnt be enemies i never wanted this youre clever raskolf but i knew that from fighting alongside you in the past you are also a good liar but you will never be as good a liar as those invaders who have tricked you into serving as a tool in the destruction of your own people theyve tricked you into starting a civil war and once the dust settles they will not have to deal with as many of us the battle hasnt even started yet but whether my warriors fall against yours today matters not our blood is already on your hands unless i can do what you failed to do and change the portents of a high priestess raskolf shuddered and clenched his fists im not here to make demands im not here to ask you to leave you may be clever raskolf but you are backed into a corner and i outnumber you significantly unless your allies can summon this undead army of theirs to come and save you khulgar turned his back to raskolf ozvolt started backing down the hill after his packleader greki lingered a moment and held out the bottle to rhodi rhodi silently motioned for him to keep it greki nodded sadly and looked down at his feet he took a deep breath and raised his chin as if he were about to say something to rhodi but was silenced before any words could leave his lips as ozvolt yanked on his cloak choking him and causing him to stumble backwards he managed not to drop the bottle as khulgar headed back down toward his troops he did not look back khulgar shouted raskolf the graytide packleader stopped in his tracks but said nothing he still did not face raskolf remember the battle at crooked jaw im disappointed in you raskolf calling in a favor wont save you or your warriors have you no dignity thats not what im asking i just want you to promise that if we fall you will burn our bodies properly i am weary of marching and fighting i dont want to continue to do so after i have died i dont want to suffer the same fate that the people of ulslog did khulgar did not answer him he just walked away  the longfangs and their prisoners made good time breaking out of formation and were soon heading down into the draw they werent worried about stealth they were just trying to move as quickly as they could there was a lot of confusion at first because stanrick hadnt the time to explain what was going on now that they were on the move he was getting out of breath from explaining it over and over to warriors who were irritated to be retreating in the face of khulgar and his pack as the longfangs headed noisily into the draw grumbling and squabbling among themselves about how they could hold the pass better than the watchwolves they suddenly as a group realized that they were being watched it wasnt because of some super instinctive sixth sense or anything though it was because nikolai azra and dria who had been scouting ahead of the formation were now running straight back into the formation as fast as they could pursued by an angry swarm of arrows the nondiscriminatory missile fire almost perforated poor alvi but she was protected by harloks shield grimward warriors boiled up the draw the longfangs were badly outnumbered and clustered close together beneath shields as magrat and yawn hurried to place protection spells on the lightly armored packmates looks like raskolf was right shouted stanrick to harlok as arrows thunked against their shields like hail during an autumn storm they found another way up what do we do now we cant get down harlok grunted pointed up the way theyd come and shrugged no said nikolai raskolf wanted us to leave for a reason we have a mission we cant leave started azra nearly drowned out by the howling grimwards and the spatter and splintering of arrows dammit magrat shoot back at them or something maybe that will get their heads down or slow them down we cant leave even if we did break through we would be abandoning the watchwolves flank now we need to create a diversion growled dria through clenched teeth i thought this was the diversion said yawn the watchwolves are the diversion said stanrick well their diversion isnt going to work unless we can create a diversion for that diversion said dria grah hriggle nyar snarled harlok pantomiming violently and jamming a knife into the dirt and drawing little xs in the mud with his fingers kryungrs wrpkcs what did he say asked nikolai he said that khulgars group was a diversion too grunted yawn as he strained against a boulder and tried to budge it with his back magrat was using a young longfang novice for cover everytime she popped up from behind him and his shield she dropped a grimward warrior with one of her arrows she was focusing on the archers and anyone else who didnt have a shield you better figure out what we are doing she shouted as she knocked another arrow they will be right on top of us in a moment the muddy winter earth made a loud sucking and popping sound as yawn pushed every muscle in his legs and core to the limit seeing the boulder budge just the slightest harlok rushed to help him push followed closely behind by one of the younger longfang warriors the boulder popped and slurped as it pulled away from the cold wet earth but the three warriors couldnt quite get it to break free an arrow shrieked in suddenly and struck yawn in the ribs causing him to double over in pain as he did so the boulder began to settle back into the cradle of the earth pushing the others back stanrick shouted nikolai we need a decision military commanders throughout history have been forced to make many impromptu life or death decisions stanrick wasnt really used to this sort of thing but he remembered something he had overheard raskolf say to william once in combat leaders only ever actually have three options no matter what the situation boils down to or how complicated it may appear at first glance the three options are either to advance hold or fall back which ever one is most likely to accomplish the mission is the best one as the arrows thudded around and into the longfangs stanrick suddenly felt a moment of clarity time seemed to slow down and a plan materialized in his mind he didnt even remember thinking of it it was just there and seemed to him as though hed been working it out for some time actually stanrick looked to the ridge behind them stanrick shouted nikolai yawn bellowed with rage and pain forcing every muscle in his body to tighten all at once as he heaved against the boulder with the sudden blinding might of a legend from the sagas he didnt get to see the carnage it caused though he was unconscious before it was even halfway down the slope nikolai said stanrick i have a plan years of combat had hardened the longfangs into a veteran warpack who knew when it was time to just follow orders and not ask questions and the last five minutes of combat had taught the novices when to follow the lead of the veterans now was one of those times stanrick grabbed the two prisoners ran to the edge of the ridge and looked down it wasnt really a cliff it was more like a really steep slope that probably would be awful to climb at least that was what he kept telling himself over and over again in his head the terrain below were wetlands that fed the red squirrel river the village of ulslog could be seen not far away stanrick waited until the grimwards were almost to the top of the draw he ordered the shield wall to open ranks exposing himself and the prisoners to the advancing horde lycon graytide and corvo blackwing led the charge up the draw they were almost within closing distance of the longfangs when the enemy formation suddenly opened ranks and split in half exposing two longfang warriors and two ulven women with their hands bound harlok and lycon recognized each other at exactly the same moment an uncontrolled wail escaped corvos lips as he recognized alvi thats right thought stanrick to himself ive got something you want come get it stanrick looked wargah in the eyes you arent with child or anything are you he asked her wargah shook her head no she gave him a puzzled look then glancing over the edge of the ridge repeated the same gesture though more vigorously as it dawned on her stanrick longfangs boot was already heading for her chest alvis eyes were wide with terror as she watched her cousins ungraceful and traumatic tumble down the ridge an excruciating scream echoed through the countryside and actually froze the advancing horde in its tracks well said stanrick quietly after a few seconds now we know that the fall is survivable harlok go harlok grabbed the flailing and shrieking form of his prisoner tucked her petite form into his chest behind his shield and jumped seconds later yawns unconscious bulk was rolled over the edge closely followed by the rest of the longfangs the grimwards stood in shocked silence for at least a minute before corvo fell to his knees and howled in agony and rage his pack gave him a wide berth as he screamed and tore the dead winter grass from the earth by the roots the fall had caused some of the warriors to black out but for yawn it had done the exact opposite he was wide awake now and his heart was racing somehow he had wound up at the bottom of a very steep ridge his packmates were lying in heaps all around him a few of them werent moving yawn jumped to his feet and started shaking his friends awake some of them looked to be pretty badly injured the longfangs had tried a variety of methods to their descent some had just jumped some had tried to run down really fast and some had tried to slide down the slope regardless of their ingenuity no one had made it more than halfway before they began rolling and bouncing up on the ridge grimward warriors had rushed to the edge of the ridge and looked down upon the battered longfangs there was a lot of murmuring laughing and exaggerated gesticulations on the part of the higher ground theyre still alive exclaimed one warrior ill fix that remarked an archer drawing back his bow and leaning over the edge he loosed exactly one arrow before corvo blackwings shield broke into his eye socket and caused a blowout injury to his shooting eye youll hit alvi you imbecile shrieked corvo they are getting away corvo growled lycon corvo looked down upon the battered longfangs the enemy was slowly retreating through the wetlands and towards ulslog some of them limped some clutched at their sides and a few were being carried unconscious by the others theyll be out of range soon said lycon no said corvo we will catch them at that pace we can go safely back down the draw around the ridge and still overtake them forget about them yelled one of the grimwards khulgar is counting on us yes agreed another my brother is fighting the traitors as we speak and counting on us to flank them corvo snarled drew his sword and began storming off back down the draw we arent letting them get away they have two of our people not long ago was not one of those women your packleader and is not the other one a future priestess now follow me lycon pleaded the grimwards talk some sense into your protege lycon stood silently at the top of the ridge for a moment staring down at the limping silhouette of harlok longfang with his remaining arm he reached across his chest and felt the emptiness where his other arm used to be his lip curled into a snarl  shields cracked together and the graytides pushed with all their might against the watchwolf formation it was an uphill battle however quite literally the graytides were not only fighting the confined space of the choke point but gravity itself the interlocked shields of the watchwolves created an impenetrable wall spears and long axes flashed out from over the wall and down on top of the graytides who simply couldnt defend themselves from two separate angles at once it was a deadly bloody grind and the wounded were beginning to pile up khulgar knew that they would never make any progress like this the enemy had too good a position to defend and while khulgar outnumbered them it certainly wasnt by enough to win by attrition where is corvo he wondered back on the ridge some of the grimwards were still pleading with lycon to talk some sense into corvo while yet others had already started following the blackwing down into the draw lycon tore his eyes from his hated longfang enemy below and turned to face the warriors who now looked to him in their moment of doubt corvo is the leader lycon growled we will follow his lead and not question him but what about khulgar shouted a bearded veteran nearly as old as lycon neither corvo nor lycon gave an answer within a minute only three warriors stood atop the draw the three grimwards looked to the path they should follow to relieve khulgar then down the draw to the trail their leaders were blazing one by one they made their decisions  corvo and lycon moved quickly down the draw and around the base to the wetlands the longfangs were making much better time than they had expected and were nearly to the village already though the mud and the muck slowed their progress a little the grimwards were in much better shape to be running and began to close the gap it was strenuous however and before long many of the more heavily armored warriors were falling behind corvo and lycon were at the front plowing through the marshy terrain like machines built for the purpose they hadnt really communicated anything resembling a plan to anyone and stared intently at their quarry as they trudged through the muck the others did their best to keep up despite the burning in their legs and the raggedness of their breath magrat did her best to slow their advance with her archery corvo had a couple of her arrows sticking out of his shield as a matter of fact she had mainly been targeting him since he was the closest she hadnt shot at the one armed ulven though he looked older and it didnt really seem fair he didnt have a shield or anything even though he was up at the front stop running and face me harlok he shouted followed by a string of curses as he lost a boot in the freezing muck of the wet earth he hesitated for only a moment then continued on without his footwear harlok longfang was angry he didnt want to run from lycon he wanted to turn and fight but he couldnt pass off the girl he was carrying to anyone else she wouldnt walk or run on her own and there was no one else available to carry her who wasnt wounded or helping someone else harlok trudged on and snarled in rage it was all he could do they were almost to the village of ulslog the elevation was gradually rising and the earth was becoming more firm soon the grimwards would be free of the mud that had given the longfangs a fair shot at escape and they would be overtaken the longfangs just made it inside the front gate of the stockade that butted up against the riverbank the grimwards were hot on their heels less than a stones throw away and gaining close the gates close the gates shouted stanrick magrat try to pick off the closest ones hurry the longfangs all rushed to push the heavy gates closed while magrat fired the last of her arrows through the shrinking gap the gate closed just in time and the longfangs struggled to hold the doors shut against the push of the grimwards as the bar was placed on the other side corvo and lycon howled and called the longfangs cowards be brave alvi shouted corvo through the fence i swear upon my honor that i will see you safely returned home alvi whimpered hysterically she was lying on the ground in the fetal position exactly where harlok had dropped her when he rushed to hold the gates closed what now stanrick asked nikolai there arent enough of us to defend this place stanrick looked across the stockade to the river bank that was never the plan he said follow me harlok grabbed alvi by the arm and began dragging her after stanrick and the others the sudden jolt caused her to stumble to her feet and elicited a piercing shriek from her throat on the other side of the fence corvo panicked and began hurling his body against the stockade doors alvi he screamed alvi  khulgar had no choice but to fall back his warriors were cut to pieces and the steep rocky path was black with blood in the moonlight the watchwolves did not pursue them and he knew that they would not the graytides may have been battered but they still had numbers and raskolf was no fool experience had taught khulgar that now was the time to move find a safe place set up a perimeter and triage his casualties as much as he loathed to do so he decided that the stockade at ulslog was probably the safest place to be until he found out what had happened to his allies safest at least from a physical standpoint his daughter of gaia was still acting strange as the graytides limped down the hill and to the open plain below khulgar dreaded what treachery or misfortune could have befallen his trusted comrades and his hatred of the watchwolves and longfangs was doubled it was a longer march to ulslog than it should have been and every shadow looked like an ambush as the village came into view the graytides saw torch light within the walls and cautiously approached the village was occupied by the grimwards where in gaias name were you when we needed you screamed khulgar handing his shield to a novice and nearly pushing him over with the violence of the action wheres corvo wheres lycon no one answered khulgar howled in rage and threw his helmet at a grimward warrior you he shouted pointing to a bearded veteran what happened did you get lost no packleader growled the warrior straightening his back and raising his chin did you misunderstand the plan no packleader he replied then what in the name of the great wolfs hindquarters were you doing the longfangs came this way packleader the longfangs came this way sneered khulgar so what you abandoned your mission and the brave warriors who were depending on you so you could follow the longfangs tell me soldier if the longfangs jumped off a cliff would you follow them the warrior looked positively stupefied the world fell completely silent and it was too late in the season for there to even be crickets chirping well said khulgar it wasnt up to me stammered the warrior corvo made the decision and lycon backed him we had no choice the warriors eyes drifted up over khulgars shoulder there was a fire on top of the ridge then another and another the way the three fires burned showed that they were elevated like funeral pyres well said khulgar where are they did you take them alive or did you kill them they escaped packleader they escaped in canoes down the river we couldnt follow them there was only one canoe left and one paddle khulgar shook his head where is lycon he said khulgar osvolt and greki found lycon graytide standing on the bank of the river the four warriors stood in silence for a moment as the river rushed by what were you thinking elder growled khulgar you abandoned us lycon did not turn to face him and stared into the moving water corvo made the decision he replied not i thats weak lycon thats weak said khulgar shaking his head you knew better you should have stopped him it was your job to babysit him he has to learn to take responsibility for his decisions growled lycon no said khulgar you need to take responsibility for yours you let him do this and now you are trying to pass the blame to him this was important lycon this was personal snarled the elder turning to face khulgar personal isnt the same as important lycon shouted khulgar most people just think that it is if you are one of those people then the pack is better off without your leadership khulgar spit at his former mentors feet and turned his back to him its a good thing you arent in command anymore dont you turn your back on me khulgar bellowed lycon i taught you everything you know i hope not lycon said khulgar i hope not as khulgar walked away osvolt joined him but greki lingered behind he stood at lycons side for a moment and took a long swig from the bottle that rhodi had given him then he handed the canoe paddle to the one armed warrior and walked away  up on the ridge the watchwolves had just finished conducting final rites for the three grimward berserkers who had attacked their flank during the battle as the fire consumed the makeshift pyres the watchwolves saluted their honored foes before slipping into the night  khulgar stormed up to the longhouse the two guards posted outside looked as though they were about to try to stop him but then made eye contact with each other thought better about it and got out of his way where are you corvo he screamed thrashing through the tangle of darkness and overturned furniture until the hall opened up khulgar froze sickly yellow light danced and flickered over the desecrated walls in the name of the sacred mother he muttered why didnt you tell me about thisbelthazar  its been hours since the rainfall died away but splatters of water still cascade down on you as you walk through the dense forest its hard to see exactly where you are going though you are no longer in the mountains of your birth the hacklefurs leave their trace on the landscape there are hollows and ditches everywhere and it is impossible to pick out a straight and even path there arent any settlements around and its not likely a pack would go hunting so soon after the rain so when you hear the sound of distant movement in the undergrowth it takes you a moment to identify it grunts and harsh speech untangle themselves and you realize it must be mordok there are many different snarling voices and it is clear they are not particularly trying to be quiet which mordok only do when they are confidant and in large numbers it is hard to tell which direction they are coming from but where ever it is theyll be here soon  belthazar stands still and unlatches his axe from its holder in a fierce battle stance he cries out at the noises in undergrowth show your selves you cowards come and meet your fate after losing the last of his family at the hands of the disgusting creatures belthazar is ready if not excited to slay every last mordok who cross his path even though he hasnt had much experience with actual combat belthazar is not going to back down from this chance to take a little frustration out he holds his axe with a firm and solid grip as he slowly rotates to his right come out my axe is waiting to split your pathetic heads open  the guttural speech halts for a moment then burst out again with obvious excitement a mordok peeks its head out of one of the many ditches in the woods and it pauses when it sees you but as it takes in your surroundings and your lack of companions a savage grin lights its face it calls back and as the rest of the mordok hove into view you might start to regret your hasty challenge at your count there are ten of them one or two are scrawny likely whelps but the rest are full sized and are bristling with a rusty array of weaponry they make no immediate move to attack and you find this very strange instead they look back to the last mordok coming out of the ditch it is clearly the leader here and from what you know very likely a shaman of some kind it wears no armor and is decorated with many bits of fur feathers and bones from one of its hands trails a rope attached to the other end is a figure that is very clearly not mordok it is hunched over and filthy and you cannot tell if it is ulven or human a warning flag goes up in your mind the mordok do not take captives any victims that fall into their hands meet a fate that is painful and horrifying as it is swift the shaman examines you meeting your eyes boldly a savage intelligence gleams there but before you can make sense of it the mordok breaks eye contact and snaps an order to its underlings the group of mordok growl gleefully hefting their weapons and spreading out its clear a fight is on your hands but this fight is also very much one sided  you heft your axe in your hands returning the mordoks vicious snarls in kind running is not an option there are too many of them and your fathers death still burns deep inside you you will not run and you vow to take as many of them down as you can outnumbered as you are the mordok still hesitate none of them wanting to be the first and therefore the most vulnerable the circle begins to close on you you know this will mean your death and you yell and charge one of the whelps it skips back out of range of your wild swing but your momentum carries you forward bulling the creature over it screeches and tumbles over its muddy rags entangling its limbs before it can recover you drive your axe into its throat its dying cry burbles out around from the blood and the hole in its throat the other whelp hisses in rage and rushes in after you scoring a shallow gash along your arm it isnt dire but you know the mordok favor poisons the whelp continues to relentlessly attack giving you no time to further contemplate your situation except for the next incoming attack you are grateful for the sturdiness of your axe as the creature pounds recklessly at it the gratitude is short lived as one of the warriors bounds up a spear in hand it jabs viciously at you and you are barely able to dodge you run the up the spearlength and take a sizable chunk out of the creatures torso it squalls in pains and reels away the rest are on you before you can turn to finish it there are simply too many you and your axe are not fast enough to claw free from the group a dagger nearly pins your hand to your weapon making the hand useless snarling with fury and sure that you are about to meet the great wolf you throw yourself upon the nearest warrior hacking and clawing for all your worth a blow to the back of your head clouds your eyes and you stagger to the your knees the beasts set up a victorious howl and swarm you and you know that your death is upon you but no blade steals your life no teeth ravage your body instead the creatures take advantage of your momentary confusion and quickly bind your hands behind your back kicking your axe out of reach only when you are secured does the shaman finally approach the creatures crowd anxiously away from their leader it grabs your chin and brings your face close to its own mal kul lat glokhai glob it hisses  belthazar looks into the eyes of the shaman he thinks that with his hands tied there is no way for survival but curious belthazar is wondering why this important figure in the mordok culture is taking the time to talk to him belthazar wants to spit at the mordok leader but decides that if he wants to keep his head on his shoulders he better not the curiosity overwhelms belthazar and he decides that it cant get worse he lowers his head to show his submissive side what do you want with me he asks with a sigh he isnt expecting an answer but he just wanted to try be fore they decide to kill him which is most likely what they are planning to do  the shaman seems surprised then pleased by your capitulation very pleased lat thrakum lorz glok garn ashdautas vrasublatlat apparently this is very funny to the assembled mordok they cackle gleefully sindokgoth nargzabub za lorz glok he quickly loops another length of rope around your neck tightening it enough that you would be unable to slip out of it but still able to breathe he hauls on your leash forcing you to your feet ukhizgu he starts off dragging you and the other ragged prisoner after him a small commotion sets up behind you and the female mordok you wounded in the side staggers to the shaman she is bleeding heavily and will not live long without treatment you are quite satisfied with this thought however the shaman grumbles mightily and hands your leads off to another warrior he examines the wound closely beginning to chant in a low and malevolent voice his chant gains intensity as he takes up a handful of wet dirt from the forest floor suddenly he jams it into the females wound she grunts and wavers on her feet but manages to stand as the shaman finishes smearing the wound with dirt after a moment she flexes and nods to the others the shaman snatches up the lead ropes again and drags you after they set a brisk pace allowing for no rest you are capable of keeping up the brutal pace though after a few hours your head begins to ache abominably and your wounds though superficial begin to burn your fellow prisoner is not so lucky its clear they have been in the keeping of the mordok for sometime and they are weak and slow occasionally they will stumble and is dragged a few lengths in the wet leaves and mud the mordok always laugh and jeer at the sight but strangely the mordok always wait until the ragged figure regains their feet before continuing onward finally as the sun is beginning to set the other prisoner falls to the ground and does not get up the shaman snarls and aims a kick a them but the being only continues to tremble on the ground the shaman drags you and the other prisoner to a tree and deftly secures you to it the other mordok begin to set about putting up a crude camp leaving you and your fellow victim to your own devices  belthazar looks at the other victim hey are you ok whats your name belthazar looks down at his feet and starts to wonder bout what the mordok are planning for them he thinks to himself what kind of mess have i gotten myself into now belthazar looks back towards the other being tied up next to him my names belthazar as the time passes belthazar grows restless and starts to think of escape plans but with the both of them in their condition it would pointless to even try the only thing he can come up with is to stay alive as long as possible  your fellow turns to you and for the first time you get a good look at them they are male you realize now under their ragged hood you can see the hint of pointed ears syndar then but what really catches your attention are his eyes they are notsane it takes a moment for them to focus on you it is as if he was thousands of miles away when they focus on you it is with an intensity that makes you slightly uncomfortable he continues to stare at you through your introduction and does not offer his own name or any words at all as you grow restless the syndar seems to echo your emotions suddenly his focus on you again and he begins to babble incoherently you cant really make out what he is saying it sounds mostly fluid maybe the syndar language a few phrases are harsh and guttural sounding almost like the mordok the one word you can make out sounds like behtak you hear a voice from the group of mordok raised and angry a rock flies by and strikes the tree you are both secured to the syndar does not flinch but is immediately silenced he looks cowed and afraid and will not respond to anything after this the night passes and you both fall into an uneasy sleep when you wake you are feeling feverish and unwell the hand that was damaged by the dagger is swollen with angry red lines streaking down your arm you remember the mordok propensity for poisoned weapons but before you can dwell on it much longer the shaman comes to both of you he sets down two beaten water skins and two portions of whatever they had been eating the night before the syndar sets upon upon it practically inhaling his rations you are unsure about the identity and quality of the meat but you have not eaten since the day before the shaman eyes you lat brogbu he grunts  belthazar looks down at the food and as he hears his stomach growl he decides to eat after the food was gone and the water drank belthazar leaned back up against the tree  im getting really tired of being treated like an animal by these disgusting beings belthazar muttered under his breath the chance of a successful escape is slim to none belthazar slips back into his thoughts what does this shaman want with me why has he taken me prisoner instead of executing me on the spot not long after that last thought belthazar dreams of sinking his axe straight into the shamans skull he opens his eyes looks at his syndar ally if only he were a mage or a cleric he could help me escape but in his current state he probably cant tell up from down so as far as belthazar can tell he is going to be a pet for a little while unless a miracle happens the day turns out to be much like the previous the mordok drive you relentlessly allowing for no rest no food no water the female you had previously wounded in the stomach takes special notice of you whenever you stumble whenever you fall behind she is there to kick you viciously back into line your hand wound begins to burn intensely and the pain travels up your arm throbbing the miles and tracks of forest begin to blur together fever sets in and you are barely aware of the syndar suffering next to you of what direction you are going you think only of forcing yourself to take the next step so that the kicks and savage blows do not come from some depth you knew not even existed fed with the feverish and blind hatred of these creatures you manage to pull the strength to continue on but it cannot last eventually as the sun begins to set even your deep rage fails you you stumble and fall the female is there immediately viciously kicking you trying to force you to rise you manage a noise halfmoan of defeat halfsnarl of of defiance when you fail to stand the female reaches for her club for the second time in as many days you think your death is upon you as she raises her weapon suddenly the shaman is there he grabs the females wrists and bends it backwards viciously she howls in agony and drops her weapon with his other hand the shaman grabs her by the throat bringing her close to his face lat azub lorzglok sindokgoth azub lat he spits at her and shoves her away in disdain kneeling down he grabs your wounded hand examining it closely callously prodding it sending fresh jolts of pain through your body you are dimly aware of the shaman beginning a harsh chant over your body and some animal instinct surfaces sheer terror and panic does what rage and anger could not and you flail trying to get away the shaman coldly grabs you and slams you back to the ground not even pausing in his spell casting dazed you watch as he finishes chanting and grinds a handful of wet leaves into the open and festering wound on your hand the pain is nothing like you have ever known it is sharp and throbbing and aching all at once it drives all breath from your body all thought from your mind it is as if any and every pain such a hand wound could ever feel all condensed into a few seconds of pure intense agony the shock of it is the only thing that keeps you conscious as your vision begins to black it stops as quickly as it started you gasp for breath and the fog clears away your fever is gone burned out and the wound is closed and left behind is nothing but a raised scar the pink of healthy and healed flesh nausea hits you and you turn over and vomit what little was left in your belly and a small pile of a black slimy substance you look up at the shaman in confusion and horror slowly the realization that you were subjected to vile mordok magic seeps into your mind and making your gorge rise again you dry heave coughing not giving you time to recover the shaman drags you by your collar to another tree where you are bound fully again the syndar stares forlornly at you your vision begins to swim and exhaustion hits you like a tidal wave as your eyes close you see something else in the mad syndars eyes pity  when you awake it is dark and cold you are alone by the tree the syndar gone but not unheard from the circle of firelight you can see the mordok gathered around muttering and growling to themselves but above them you can hear a man alternately shrieking in anguish and crying pitifully the shaman is bellowing words what they are you do not know you do not know how long this goes on sometimes the syndar responds to the shaman sometimes he only suffers eventually he falls silent and the ranks of the mordok break the shaman passes through dragging the syndar by his hair he drops the syndar in an unconscious heap and then turns to stare at you you can read the meaning in the foul beasts eyes you are next as the shaman reaches for your lead you snap the fear and anger course through your veins and you throw yourself wildly at the creature you head butt snarl and bite savagely as the mordok pack drags you off and into the circle of firelight still struggling wildly your wrists and neck are bound to a stake in the ground every time you pull against the stake the rope around your neck tightens cutting off your air the shaman watches you struggle impassively until you tire you stare at him panting as he walks over and sits on his knees in front of you he begins speaking in the mordok tongue almost companionably he speaks at you for a minute or two as you stare uncomprehending he reaches for a knife and casually draws it across the flesh of your arm you snarl in pain as he dips his finger into your blood grabbing your chin he forces your head still as he draws on your forehead with your own blood still forcing you to look at him he holds up his now bloody hand and barks out a word behtak you growl and try to look away he slaps you forcing his hand into your face again behtak this continues for some time you resist and refuse to understand what this beast is trying to communicate with you his violence only escalates the more you refuse him eventually he goes for his knife even though your arms are now scored and bloody and you are in pain you will not give in after a while the shaman sits back and stares at your arms you look too and you grow afraid the flesh is ragged and you feel faint from blood loss you watch as the shaman takes up a handful of ashes and begins chanting you brace yourself though it doesnt help all breath is driven from your body and for a second you cant feel anything at all then the pain hits and you double over you watch as the ash mixes with your blood and begins to form new skin over your wounds the pain becomes too much though and the world darkens as you open your mouth to scream it is over you kneel gasping for breath the shaman grabs your chin forcing you to look at him again though you speak no common words you can guess at the meaning of its expression i can do this all nighthe seems to say behtak he grunts again holding up his bloodstained hand how long this continues you do not know each time the shaman progressively wounds you each time he heals you with extreme pain eventually you are almost mindless with agony retaining only one thing in your mind i will not submit anymore when you finally pass out it is to the image of the shaman snarling the word at you in frustration still holding out his bloody hand you wake up in the darkness next to the tree with your head cradled in the lap of the syndar he makes shushing noises at you holding a cup of luke warm water to your lips you drink gratefully and manage to croak out a thank you he shakes his head at you saying something that sounded soothing and melodic and leaves you curled up on the ground you lay there passing in and out of consciousness you force yourself to focus on the firelight and on its reflections in the dirt it takes a long time for your vision to stop wavering to realize what a reflection meant slowly you raise your head it is a rusted dagger half buried in kicked up dirt and leaves one of the mordok must have dropped it during your earlier struggle you silently flip around straining with your bound hands to snatch the dagger you grab it and lean against the tree desperately trying to saw at the ropes binding your hands the syndar observes your actions with interest your hands come free and you quickly free your neck as well the syndar eagerly turns his hands to you and you free them he snatches the dagger and frees his last bindings as well you wobble to your feet and with a last glance at the fire and the sleeping mordok you motion to the syndar come on you whisper the syndar glances fearfully back and then shakes his head you stare at him unbelieving the syndar curls up into a ball mumbling you lean in and realize for the first time he is speaking in the trade tongue youdont understand sheshe knows sheseesme icant cantcantcant he looks up at you with clarity in his eyes that wasnt there before run he whispers hysterically run before you realize what he is doing before you can stop him he sets the dagger to his throat taking his life before your eyes you stumble backward watching in horror as the blood gushes and the syndar slumps gurgling you whirl and flee into the woods away from the shaman and the madness that darkened the syndars dying eyescor leonis requiem brother kanos shouted a voice from the other side of the camp several humans raised their heads or looked around at the sound of the alarmed voice yes what is it replied the deep voice of a large and muscular man brother kanos wearing a basic tunic and lion emblazoned tabard of the order of arnaths fist set down the box of supplies he had been moving the battle brothers of the order had set up a forward camp near the onsallas village they did not want to intrude on the ulven territory so they made their own camp brother kanos the eagles bring news the lich has been sighted it is here in the swamp and it is close they are tailing it now yelled a younger man in a basic tunic finally boomed kanos this hunt comes to a close brothers prepare for battle we move out now kanos walked towards his tent and began to don his armor the small camp exploded into action as battle brothers and the volunteer militia of the order prepared for battle a younger man jogged towards the tent his healers robe swishing around him as he went kanos he said why do we move out so quickly we should send eagles to call in the other battle brothers in the nearby settlements cedrick would not want to miss out on this chance now that we are so close it was customary in the order to address each other by the title brother before their name but in this case it was not needed kanos was the older and more experienced brother amongst three siblings cedrick was the middle brother and mahlik being the youngest the fact that blood bound them together gave mahlik a bit of leeway outside of the traditional customs of the order such as properly addressing ones superiors or giving them tactical advice brother mahlik we move immediately this has been the first confirmed sighting since the spring and the lich is on the move this is the best opportunity we have to ending it for good i wont lose it by sitting back and letting it slip through my fingers said kanos as he strapped on platemail bracers he had already put on his gambeson and chainmail and would soon be covered head to toe in full metal armor brother kanos dont you think it wise to bring all of our battle brothers together for this in case we need them we have yet to get in contact with aeden the masters sent us out here to find him too replied mahlik enough brother said kanos your concerns are valid but i have made my decision without other greater undead or a gravestone powering it the lich will be weak enough that we can end the plague now on mardrun before it has a chance to even truly begin send a message to cedrick and let him know that i will meet you both back here tomorrow evening this ends tonight kanos finished buckling on his platemail breastplate and grabbed his great helm from the stand in his tent even without his armor kanos was a mountain of a man and in full platemail he dwarfed most of his fellow battle clerics wait brother i am going with you i am not going to stay in camp while you hunt down the lich protested mahlik brother you know your place is here he said hefting his tower shield you are new to the studies and this fight will be dangerous even if the lich is weakened oversee the camp and prepare for our return that is an order   hold your line brothers roared kanos as the wave of undead slammed into the orders shield wall kanos was in the middle of the line with two other lions at his side the flanks of the wall were made up of more lightly armored starkhaven militia the far flank was held by another fully armored lion so that the discipline of the line would hold even if they took losses the zombies pressed in on the line their stiffly curled hands clawing broken fingernails across the tower shields of the order they groaned and pressed and reached over the shields to grab at the humans but the men of starkhaven maintained their line and held their ground after the initial wave had hit and lost momentum weapons flashed out as swords and hammers crashed down on the undead again and again the steel weapons of the order struck out to chip and grind away at the dark energy that kept each corpse together kanos expected the lich to have zombies guarding him but he didnt expect he would have quite this many the shield wall containing the lions and militia were being pressed hard by horde of zombies about two times their size they were doing well holding the line and even managed to drop a handful of the zombies already kanos knew that most of them would rise again but knocking them down was a sign of progress repeatedly the lionetched warhammer rained down on the bodies in front of his shield smashing aside the zombies and shattering dried bits of flesh from their dessicated bodies kanos glanced to his right and saw two militia members get grappled the sheer number of undead dragging them to the ground one zombie had already sank its teeth into the shoulder and neck of a lightly armored volunteer as he cried out in pain kanos knew it was time brother geshin now yelled kanos as he hammered a zombie in the face and heaved another back with his shield the lion to kanos left dropped back and cast his shield aside to mutter a divine prayer brother geshin finished the prayer by shooting his arms out perpendicular to his body and casting a divine barrier the sudden aura of divine energy pushed the undead on the shield wall back the zombies currently grappling the two fallen militia men reeled in shock as holy energy wracked their forms and they were brutally cut to pieces by the other men of the shield wall as they fell writhing to the ground the lions of the order finished them with blessed weapons and dispelled the dark energy holding the corpses together the bloodied militia men clenched their teeth in pain as they staggered back to resume their positions in the shield wall with the divine barrier giving them some respite the lions began to bless their weapons again or rejuvenate their comrades with divine energy the fight was long from over but the order was prepared for this the lions stepped forward and began to strike at the undead from the safety of the barrier brothers i can maintain the barrier for a bit longgurk started brother geshin before his words were cut short and ended in a gurgled cry kanos spun around to see brother geshin fall to his knees geshins arms faltered as blood gushed out of the smoking hole in the side of his breastplate he wheezed and coughed a voiceless and bloody cry as he dropped the barrier that had been protecting the group brother kanos watched as geshin collapsed lifelessly to the ground clutching at the empty sky behind the fallen lion stood the lich clad in tattered black its hand still extended from casting the death bolt that smote brother geshin flanking the lich were several undead bodyguards these armored undead held weapons and shields and moved with intelligence and speed surpassing the common zombies of the horde knowing they had stepped into a trap was bad enough but after witnessing the sheer power of the lich and his greater undead guards kanos knew that something was wrong the lich was not in a weakened state it must have created a gravestone in the swamp mahlik was right kanos should have listened to him behind us roared kanos as he shifted his tower shield the armored lion holding the left flank stepped in towards the lich and cast a divine spell divine ba was all he managed to say before the lich flicked a wrist out and rammed the cleric in the chest with a magical push the lion flew backwards away from the line and crashed into the zombies on the other side in seconds they were on him several bodies piled on top of the lion and the sheer weight pinned him to the ground teeth broke and rotten fingernails tore upon his platemail the heavy armor would keep him alive for a while but it was only a matter of time before the ravening horde found the chinks in his armor the cleric was unarmed having lost his weapon and shield when he was pushed back the lich stepped in towards the lines kanos charged slamming his warhammer into the creature several times before he too was blasted with a kinetic push that sent him flying backwards rolling and bouncing as he went kanos crashed into the zombie horde his massive figure sending them flying like bowling pins in moments other zombies descended upon him like they did the previous lion and kanos was in a desperate struggle he couldnt see anything except for some part of the inside of his great helm other than the visor he could hear rotting nails screeching on his shield and armor and the grating and wet cracking of broken teeth on the platemail gorget protecting his neck roaring in rage the lion warrior shoved several zombies aside and began to blindly attack with his hammer from the ground every swing landed on his opponents but there were just too many of them just then one of the militia members charged in and tried to clear the zombies away he was brave but his action would cost him his life rotten and withered arms reached out and grabbed him pulling him closer into the mass of undead on top of kanos the lightly armored militia man was dragged down screaming for help until he fell on top of kanos tower shield the zombies tore into the man clawing and biting and tearing his flesh within moments the man was torn to shreds his entrails and blood pouring down onto kanos and his armor all at once like someone had dumped out a bucket at a slaughterhouse while the undead feasted on the mans body on top of kanos the lion continued to struggle to find a way out from the tangled horde he was able to turn to his side and get one arm and one leg under him with every ounce of strength he had kanos roared and power lifted up sending several zombies flying through the air and crashing into the swamp around him he lost his tower shield somewhere under the mass of bodies but there was no time to retrieve it covered in swamp muck and gore kanos fixed his helm and finally got a glimpse of how the fight was going the lion taken to the ground had stopped struggling and had either suffocated or been torn to shreds his body still covered in a mass of undead brother geshin stared into the sky with dead eyes a handful of militia were still standing bloodied and fighting back to back while others struggled on the ground with their attackers several more lay on the ground motionless brother dayson was struggling trying to fight one of the lichs guards and block its attacks he would have been doing well if it were not for the zombie that had grappled his back and was tearing into his exposed shoulder where his armor had been broken open judging by his slow movements brother dayson would soon fall the final lion was maintaining a divine barrier giving the last couple militia time to regroup it was working until the lich stepped forward and blasted a hand sized fist through the lions thigh with a bolt of death and black energy the lion went down in a scream of pain and the undead wasted no time shambling into attacking range they were losing fast and everything that led up to this moment fueled kanos rage he walked forward with a growl and bellowed a prayer to arnath before calling forth the flow of mana i am his shield and his strength i banish you with divine wrath kanos yelled as he pressed his palms out towards the nearest zombie in his way the air rippled with energy as a blast of pure divine power burst out and slammed into the zombie ripping the dark energy from its body and sending it tumbled into a broken mass of flesh some fifteen feet away he stepped past the body and walked quickly towards brother dayson who finally collapsed under the wounds sustained by the lich guards rusty blade a zombie stepped in kanos way but a full on punch to the temple with a plate gauntlet sent the zombie crashing to the ground and kanos never broke stride i am the light in the darkness i banish you with divine wrath kanos yelled again as he pressed his palms out towards the back of the guard it never even saw him as the second divine blast cracked its spine and ripped apart its body the broken lich guard sailed through the air over brother daysons body and crumpled when it landed with the guard fallen there was nothing standing between kanos and his intended target the lich even at full strength a lich would be severely damaged by the pure and raw energy of his gods divine wrath and kanos had enough mana and hatred to pummel it again and hopefully finish the job as kanos stopped close enough for the spell to work he began to call upon the flow of mana the lich turned to face him but it was too late kanos was too close i am a lion of arnaths fist i banish you from this realm with divine wrath kanos yelled as he pushed the energy straight into the lich the blast slammed into its chest and it reeled back several steps shrieking as the dark energy keeping it animated was almost torn completely from its body it was not enough to destroy it outright but the blast wounded it badly knowing it would take more kanos wasted no time in channeling forth more mana not here not again lich for my fallen battle brothers i banish you from this realm with divine wrath roared kanos as he dug deep into his faith and harnessed the raw power of his gods wrath his rage at losing brothers to the lich helped harness the energy and kanos hated the lich with the core fibers of his being in the split second it took kanos to extend his arms towards the lich though a lich guard rushed in and placed its own body in between the lich and kanos instead of releasing his gods wrath into the lich again the lich guards body took the blast at point blank range the attack instantly shattered the corpse destroying it outright and sent it tumbling away kanos stumbled in surprise at what happened and then regained his composure to call upon more mana you will not escape judgement i banish you with div was all kanos could get out as a prismatic blast of energy struck him head on and cut him short the lich had stunned him with a simple rudimentary arcane spell and kanos stumbled backwards clutching his head for what seemed like an eternity the only thing that kanos could comprehend was piercing light and the muffled sounds of all that was around him the sound of the militia being torn limb from limb the gnashing teeth on fresh bloody meat the sword screeching through the plate armor of brother dayson as he was finished off and the slowed beating of kanoss own heart under the effects of the spell during the final dying breaths of a brave few ten seconds can seem like forever when his senses returned to normal kanos opened his eyes to the extended palm of the lich at his chest time returned to normal speed a kinetic blast of energy rammed him in the gut and sent him flying backwards into the dirt he landed with a thud and his great helm was knocked clean off his head with a hacking cough kanos regained his breath and tried to stand the lich walked closer to him and summoned forth blue tinted energy in its hands flicking its wrists forward it assaulted the cleric with bolts of energy that struck him as hard as any forged blade the furious rain of bolts dented and bent his armor and rent his flesh until finally one cracked his breasplate and tore into his stomach blood oozed out of the clerics armor and he knew the wound was deep cedrick mahlik i am sorry i should have listened choked kanos as he looked at the pool of his own blood forming at his feet he was mortally wounded and there was only one thing left to do i pray that you somehow know that i died a good death i am arnaths fist roared kanos as he filled himself with intense rage and charged at the lich completely ignoring his grievous wounds his death was imminent but he would not meet it while on his knees  its ok elise i will hold them back grab venator and go struggled cedrick as his arms threatened to fall the sheer weight of maintaining so many divine barriers proving to be too much but im scared cried the little ulven girl elise was inside the divine barrier she and cedrick were the last two left near the gravestone with the lich away the soldiers of vandregon and their ulven allies were able to perform a ritual and destroy the gravestone venator had flown into a rage and charged the undead surrounding them to try to take as many down before the group had to flee elise its ok they cant hurt you if my arms are up the barrier will hold them back trust me they cant get you go over and help venator get back to the outpost said cedrick through almost gritted teeth the ulven girl was terrified but complied and ran out to get the wounded ulven she was able to make it away from the zombies and moved through the swamp as fast as she could cedrick maintained the barrier but knew he could not last much longer the undead were around him but suddenly turned and noticed raskolf of the watchwolf clan and several other wounded allies nearby dread realization sunk in when cedrick saw that if the undead turned their attention on them as they fled they would be outrun and torn apart the zombies had to be stopped or distracted so the others could get away cedrick looked down at his mangled legs wounded from the corruption of the gravestone and knew he was not getting out of here alive it was this moment that he knew he could still do something to help and lowered his arms and dropped the divine barrier hey over here come on face me yelled cedrick as the zombies turned at the noise and the absence of the barrier that kept them away with fresh meat closer and within reach the undead surrounding cedrick moved in for the kill as raskolf and the others dragged the wounded farther into the swamp the last thing they heard was brother cedrick yelling a prayer to his god in defiance as the zombie horde descended upon him  it had been four days brother mahlik  asked one of the order camps workers from the tent opening yes said mahlik from the small study in his tent to pass the time mahlik had taken to studying scrolls and texts to busy his mind and he had a number of them opened and held down by rocks and was reading by candlelight since it was well into the evening his brothers should be back by now he knew it even if he refused to admit it the others are worried that if the mordok attack we will not be able to stop them we are near onsallas but not close enough to be protected by our ulven allies said the worker uncomfortably mahlik knew that he should not have waited this long and that to stay any longer was endangering everyone in the camp he could not shake the feeling that if he gave in and stopped waiting for their return that it would finally make it real to give up and leave would admit that his brothers were most likely dead youre right we have waited long enough start taking down the camp we will move to the outpost in the morning and link up with allies or other order members there said mahlik heavily the worker nodded and left mahlik set the scroll down he was pretending to read and stared blankly into the flickering light of the candles lost in his inner thoughts  magrat stared silently down upon the man she had known for only a few days his body was torn and sprawled the white lion on his chest spattered with blood that it should come to this the longfang had become a second home to her but they could never replace her tribe her family that this human should be her closest link to her people it would be hilarious if it wasnt so damn depressing though she was exhausted from the breaking of the gravestone and and the healing of the ulven girl she had work to do and could not rest as silently as she could she gathered the dead human and his belongings and laid him on a hasty but servicable pyre she bowed her head over him and chanted quietly invocking the spirits of the land and his ancestors to guide him on his final journey she prayed for the man whose order had been her peoples enemies for far longer than she had been alive spirits grant this man honor guide his feet as he journeys home tell him we honor him for an honoured enemy is as good as an honoured friend she took up her ritual knife and took some of him taking some of his strength and power into herself she took his lions tabard torn and bloody before setting the pyre ablaze it might attract the mordok or any zombies remaining in the area but cedrick would not return and was laid to rest it would take the messenger a few days to find the nearest order group his package contained cedriicks tabard and a message carefully written with the help of some of the more formally educated at the outpost at the bottom of the message was a small note we honored him as we did in the past and set him on his pyre signed was a sigil of the lost and she hoped that there would still be a vetran among their number who remembered how the lost honoured their dead a grave insult and a grave honor all at oncepack goldmane aesalif goldmane i remember that first night i got drunk i guess once my body started it knew how to find its way to what little peace it could get the drink finally gave me the energy to do what i had been considering for a long time turns out it only really takes resolve and some crazy to kill yourself i knew the best way to do it as well so nobody would be too disappointed in me im not really sure why they let me out on patrol that morning i had been up all night drinking all night i must have looked like shit i suppose they were just so relieved to finally see me up and about that they didnt much care being out on patrol was hard i was twitchy and my pleasantly numbing state of inebriation was ebbing when i finally found a mordok i lit into it despite orders i meant to get killed by that thing you know either it was too weak or there was some spark left in me that didnt want to give up not yet i beat that thing there was no finesse no sword play i hacked at it my arms driven by rage my eyes blinded with tears and my mind consumed by an unnatural glee at the carnage i was creating when i finally came back to myself i couldnt recognize the pile of offal at my feet and my packmates were staring at me it wasnt with respect neither i kept drinking and i kept trying to get myself killed i really dont know how i managed to fail at that i really wasnt trying to save myself i got fucked up sure but i healed up nicely how perverse it was some of them tried to get me to stop drinking so much but i couldnt not at that point wouldnt it was the only way i could sleep anymore and it had become my crutch he tried to reason with me but i just threw his words back in his face the more i argued with him the more poisonous my words got with anybody im pretty sure there was talk about throwing me out especially since everyone afterward so vehemently denied it i was half near a mad animal savaging myself and anyone who tried to help me everyone except her gaia bless and damn her somehow she pulled me out of the grave i was digging for myself believe me i didnt want to go it was surprisingly comfy down there and i didnt have to dream i kinda was like a project for her by helping me she was helping herself we had both lost our families and mates lost everything i guess sharing our pain made it a bit easier to bear i still murdered every filthy mordok i could get my hands on i wasnt trying to get myself killed anymore just relieving some of the pent up emotions i had i think thats why we never really realized what changes were happening around us we were too wrapped up in our own tragedies to see the one unraveling in the world at large we argued about it a lot late at night when we were alone it didnt seem right it didnt feel right i would have been first in line to tear apart some colonists believe me but there are lines you know i couldnt really figure out what to do but when they started killing mothers and children no fucking way i wont do that both of us nearly died she was almost killed in a duel by that by that overly fanged macho mute who cost us our revenge for our families i was nearly killed by our erstwhile packmates they did a number on my leg fucked it up real good funny how the one real injury i ever took was from former friends not from me trying to die shit we shacked up with the western watchwolves they took care of us got us back on our feet its just that i couldnt walk right anymore cant really run and no more fighting thats for sure she did good still angry just like she always was but she made friends in her own way got some purpose and she liked that it suited her she started going of more and more missions and shit i had to stay behind i slow everyone down you see i was just a causality a burden i had to watch them going out time and again while i grubbed in the fucking dirt i couldnt drink either they wouldnt let me she had warned them see i really didnt know what to do with myself i couldnt carve not like i used to before all this happened my hands shook too much made it hard to do much of anything useful really it made me mad real mad sometimes i wasnt sure if i was shaking because of my drinking problem or because i was so damn pissed i felt so damn useless and pushed to the side i didnt want anyones help for anything id try until id near hurt myself again i wanted to be independent but it seems like i never will didnt near hurt as much as watching her grow away though she deserved it after everything she had gone through she deserved some happiness some purpose there was no need for her to get dragged down with me i mean what use does the great wolf have for a crippled alcoholic has been warrior like me she tried to argue that but we both knew it was true i feel really bad walking out on her i left behind my oath ring so shed know so she could move on and have that better life i wasnt going to get better probably never will at this rate i left behind everything i want to say its like being reborn but its not now i just get to be alone with my thoughts maybe ill get my wish and some lucky mordok will catch me out maybe ill be doomed to limp on these dusty roads for years to come with my luck ill probably trip and break my good leg im dont really know where im going to go but that doesnt really matter much anymoreharlok longfang stanrick longfang azra steelfang imara the setting sun had dropped below the trees on the hill overlooking the ulven village of onsallas it was a warm but tolerable summer evening but that didnt help the run up the hill through the pineed tree field any easier fatigued from their previous bloody fight through the clan grimward lines a group of warriors ran full speed up the hill a pack of howling clan grimward warriors gave chase directly behind them and gave them plenty of motivation to keep running two ulven warriors harlok longfang and rogar shadowfang ran beside two humans imara and solus and they rapidly approached the outer wall of the village venator had already made it to the village previously and stood with the longfangs at the gate quick get inside shouted stanrick longfang from behind the village gate as a pack longfang hunter on the wall let loose an arrow zipping it past harloks shoulder a painful grunt from behind the group confirmed that the arrow hit its intended target the group ran through the opening as venator and stanrick heaved the heavy wooden gate shut they were too late and the two closest grimward warriors shouldered the gate threatening to push it back open if the remaining grimward caught up and battered the gate they would not be able to close it in time in the split second where the gate was being pushed on by both sides a mumbled incantation of magic escaped the lips of rill longfang who also stood near the gate standing to the side of stanrick she calmly stepped forward and spread her palms toward the closest grimward warrior through the opening a blast of magical energy hammered into the chest of the warrior sending him flying back from the gate now outnumbering their attackers venator and stanrick roared and pushed the gate back into place and closed a wooden bar slid into place and locked the gate from the bloodthirsty grimward warriors just outside the wall the twang of bowstrings rang out as several longfang hunters loosed arrows into the attackers for now they were safe from the attack outside the village catching their breath from the run the group continued to move towards the center of the village with a purpose will someone tell me what is going on roared stanrick as he followed the group rill and venator followed closely behind yawn slowed to a walk having just run to the gate to find out what the commotion was all about they both looked shocked to see imara and solus two humans inside the village they were the first humans to ever step foot inside the gate harlok led the way and stormed towards the communal longhouse a seething mass of angry ulven in armor and splattered with fresh ulven blood we were attacked by clan grimward warriors the outpost is under attack right now we ran to warn the village panted imara as she hurried to keep up with the group you are a little late human we already know clan grimward is attacking us we have barred the gates and our warriors are keeping them outside our walls said rill in a tone that betrayed her apprehension of knowing that humans were inside the village uninvited i think imara means the other threat to the village the clan whiteoak warriors said rogar from behind the group after having caught his breath clan whiteoak they are here as allies they are no threat to us they have pledged to aid clan nightriver and pack longfang against clan grimward said rill before rill yawn or stanrick could ask further questions the group walked up to the massive doors of the large ulven longhouse with all the confusion of the grimward attack harlok knew that the warriors would be there figuring out what to do next without breaking stride harlok reared back and kicked the large wooden door hard enough to send it flying open and stepped into the entryway to the longhouse  and that is why our warriors will help at the gates and protect the runeseer finished an unknown ulven in whiteoak markings at the end of the table he stopped at the thundering sound of the door being opened rogar and venator flanked harlok and all three stood in the door with weapons drawn and at the ready imara solus and the others were gathered around them as well harlok what is going on said azra steelfang as she rose from the table it looked as if she were discussing some battle plans with a clan whiteoak warrior she seemed surprised to see two humans in the village and her body language betrayed a bit of cautious hesitation and confusion she knew there was an immediate threat but didnt know from where solus the human cleric that joined imara in helping the ulven protect their village stood next to harlok and rogar and held up a piece of parchment proud pack longfang my name is solus and i am a cleric of the divine i am human i am not one of your kind but i have joined sides with pack longfang to help them and clan nightriver against clan grimward i hold in my hands a letter proof that chieftan khulgar orchestrated an attack on the outpost and the village it was written by the hand of torlin whiteoak clan whiteoak intends to betray you and raze your village to the ground even now grimward warriors are attacking the outpost magrat the green skinned syndar that wears your markings coordinates its defense against attack even as we speak said solus as he held out the letter to the group watch your tongue outsider what you claim is insane we have pledged our warriors to defend this village and to ally with clan nightriver roared a large and burly ulven warrior with the markings of clan whiteoak a dozen other armored whiteoak warriors instinctively shifted into better fighting positions in the room or discreetly moved sword hands closer to the grips of their sheathed weapons a dreadful realization of what was unfolding came across stanrick yawn and rill imara and solus stood next to rogar and venator ready to help if needed harlok stood at the tip of the group snarling with anger and staring with a feral gaze into the eyes of the whiteoak ulven that had just spoken the tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife as warriors from both sides waited the longfangs knew the claims were outrageous and hard to believe no clan in ulven history had ever committed such a betrayal but these were not normal times for the ulven it wasnt the letter that told the truth to azra it wasnt harloks reaction to the whiteoaks knowing he would never jest about such grievous matters it wasnt the words spoken by solus it was the whiteoaks themselves they stole glances at one another as if trying to wait for some kind of signal it was the eyes of the whiteoak leader how he tried to defend himself of such accusations with his words yet shifted his eyes counting the number of warriors in the room and who to attack first it was how he shifted his body away from the table so his sword would draw clear it was the look of someone caught in a dangerous lie and calculating how to come out of it alive suddenly the room burst into chaos swords cleared sheaths and were swung with deadly force the longfangs were prepared for this kind of tension their years of training and bodyguard work made them expect situations to escalate into violence but this was different these were allies inside the homes of the longfang village a few longfangs in the room were struck mortally during the initial seconds and the fight was on stanrick and harlok roared a battle cry and charged shoulder to shoulder into the room azras blade cleared a fraction of a second after the whiteoaks but her blade landed first gashing open a deep wound and clanging against his armor rogar and venator ran in to support the other longfangs in the room and cries of pain fury and oaths of vengeance rang out in the longhouse solus and imara stood in the doorway not sure how to get involved or to help when a whiteoak warrior charged out of the battle and straight into solus it caught him off guard and knocked him aside but not before his mace thudded hard against the warriors side with a crack imara stood her ground and took the abuse of his attacks on her shield the recent months of training paying off she landed a series of blows on her assailant with skill until he collapsed in the dirt outside of the longhouse clan whiteoak is attacking the village shouted imara trying to warn the other longfangs at the gate and throughout the village usually quiet and reserved imara even surprised herself with her call to action suddenly pockets of fighting broke out throughout the village as the whiteoak warriors finally attacked the next few minutes were filled with brutal and bloody battles clan whiteoak knowing their treachery was discovered had nowhere to run with the gates being barred they fought like savages inside the walls of the village a majority of the whiteoak warriors lay dead or bleeding in the longhouse and in the village joining them were a number of longfang warriors when the gates did not open the clan grimward warriors outside the wall broke off their attack the village had been saved but it had come at a terrible price you will all wait at the outpost and speak with the runeseer you are the first outsiders to walk inside these gates a lot has happened tonight and i am sure she will have plenty of questions and do not lie to her she will know  said rill quietly to imara solus rogar and venator she was trying to wash the blood off of her hands and her tunic rill knew that the next couple days would be busy and escorting the humans inside of the village and to meet with the runeseer one by one will take time bruised bloodied and exhausted the group began the somber task of assembling the dead although the selfless act of a handful of people trying to warn the village helped save many lives there would be a number of funeral pyres tonight for the fallen longfangthe dying suns last rays highlighted the long grass of the dirge swamp and the cicadas drone played its theme magrat wondered just where in its vast stretch yawn was at she wasnt sure he was ready for it she wasnt sure even she was ready the heat of these lowland summers was oppressive to her mountainbred blood she wondered if he had enough water enough food she wondered if this would even work she had worked hard to earn her place she went about her daily tasks with a zeal she had not displayed when she was back home if only this worked she was confidant the witches and daughters could learn the divine magics they had the healing they just had to learn how to bless and to ward but she could not leave her pack underprotected and understrength the undead were a new foe unlike anything the ulven had ever to face they would have to learn new ways of war ways she was far too intimately aware of she would give them this gift this new way of war but if she could she would give them an even greater gift a gift that no one could take away a gift that could be given for generations half of the ulven population could not protect themselves the males she kicked the dust up fitfully the swamp had been quiet the mordok were restless but had not made any major movements perhaps the heat had gotten to them too she hoped that they would not bother yawn on his journey she didnt understand really why males were not willworkers her own teacher had been male she knew first hand that one could be a mana weaver and still a fierce warrior old remembered bruises attested to that in fact she well knew that the discipline a shaman had to cultivate became very useful upon the battlefield and vice versa certainly she sometimes saw the daughters and witches out during combat training if her brand of magic could be learned by the males she could open a whole new way for her pack those males that had the talent could learn to fight the undead properly for when their blades and shields inevitably failed them some of the longfang were confidant they had never known an enemy that they couldnt bludgeon to death perhaps that might work for the lesser undead eventually but the lich the revenants were different most required a concentrated group to be killed that or a sufficiently stupid and completely lucky paladin she wasnt sure how many of those the ulven could count on having stanrick hadnt really approved but then again stanrick seemed to disprove of anything that smacked of new unless it came packaged with breasts or tobacco yawn had been so eager he had been a good student had she taught him enough did he understand how to properly spill his blood for his totem so that the spirit would be bonded strongly and he would not be weak from bloodloss would he remember how to call it forth even would he be able to recognize the tricksey spirits for what they were when they tested him she traced the name of a dead ulven carved into the posts of the watchtower he had been dragged off by the mordok before she had arrived there she had even gone with harlok on a mission to retrieve his remains starting her down the long road to acceptance by the longfang she felt a strange sort of kinship with the dead ulven for that she sometimes made offerings to him out of gratitude she didnt tell the other longfangs that though it was one of the many things about her people she wasnt sure theyd understand magrat sighed she desperately hoped she wouldnt be carving yawns name into the wood and making offerings to him anytime soon read morehttplasthopelarpproboardscomindexcgiactiondisplayboardstoriesthread16ixzz2evpijah4yawn longfang yawn scoured the head of his mace feverishly when he was done he would oil it to keep it from rusting it was broad daylight for the first time ever yawn had not waited until the full moon to clean his mace he didnt want their blood on it he didnt want magrats blood on his mace the feeling knowing it was there made him sick rage filled his heart along with a tinge of regret it was the regret that he hadnt caved in three heads instead of one his elders had called the attack ringing the bell swordsmen called it the helm splitter or pear splitter depending on who one talked to it was the simplest and most vicious basic attack he knew crush the sword hand and while they scream strike the helm keep striking until the helm and what lies beneath no longer functions most mace attacks worked like that target a limb and exploit the pain it caused to attack the head lungs or throat a heavy weapon like yawns mace was designed to kill quickly and with a minimum number of hits it was not as elegant or refined as sword play but it took full advantage of the strength of the wielder yawn could put an incredible amount of power behind that mace now however his strong hands ached from the delicate yet repetitive work of weapon maintenance secretly his heart ached too for the first time ever yawn had taken the life of another ulven he told himself that he didnt care hed have killed another dozen to keep magrat and his brother harlok alive yawn turned the head slowly as he worked all the races there on a mace head mordok human ulven and syndar liches didnt bleed or at least yawn hadnt been able to make it bleed so the undead were not represented there but he had fought them yawn stopped his work and looked down at the mace shaft two full faces of its handle were filled with scores no not ulven he said to himself what had been ulven mad remnants that had once been children of gaia and the great wolf but no longer he started to work the scour over his score to wipe it clean these dont mean anything not any more yawn grunted as he applied more pressure and began grinding away his kill count the kills didnt matter the count didnt matter what he had killed for did who he had killed to protect did what he had offered up to make the kills did how he had grown afterwards did the count was only a number a symbol without a meaning without a point and without a purpose a count only gets in the way he growled focusing on what has been done but clouding up what one needs to do next i wont carry the past with every strike of my mace not any more he hadnt just survived he had grown as a warrior he had been through the fire of trial by combat no longer was he looked down upon as the meeker of two brothers no one remarked on his absent fangs and eyes now unless they were looking for a thrashing no his people were proud of him but he was not content though he had found acceptance he had not found the personal fulfillment he had hoped for was it strange that now he had found acceptance as a warrior killing was no longer enough for him killing was what he was trained for true and it had earned him glory and honor but it did not complete him breaking things he thought to himself is easy i am strong wood splinters metal cracks bones shatter skulls split and leak like eggs into a pan no the real challenge isnt breaking things the real challenge is fixing things if only he could learn how to fix things if only he could learn to heal he rubbed his hand across the handle of the mace the notches had almost disappeared to the eye but could still be felt like old scars yawn would trade every notch just to save one of his friends as he leaned into his work his shoulder screamed and twitched with pain the wound had stitched but the new tissue hadnt meshed with the old yet and the difference made the joint stiff and swollen to make matters worse the grim javelin that had pierced his shoulder had been tipped with stone every flake from the head had had to be pulled up and through the wound tract before it could be sealed itd felt like the healers were pulling ice shards through a burn he paused in his work the shafts wood lay dull with fresh flat wood a few shades lighter then it had been the head still dark but cleared of friend and foes blood war had come ulven against ulven but more importantly the ghosts were real this civil war would happen but the undead were the real foe and the only thing any of them should be focusing on as he started working the scour again yawn resolved to seek something greater than himself gaias children the spirits yawn resolved to turn land and animal against foe and to serve his pack through healing that was the way to put down the walking ghosts and it was the way to give magrat his friend a little piece of her home that had been yawn had made up his mind he would seek the path of the shaman it was the only way he could fix things hed felt a pull from the dirge swamp a need a call he would take the dagger hed been carving and go once he convinced magrat that he was ready he would waste no time taking only what magrat told him in three days time he would have his totem or his death  yawns pace was slow the dirge swamp did suffer fools just not for very long he could still cover better then eight miles inside of three hours at this pace assuming he didnt run foul of the swamps more colorful features or that he didnt stumble face first in to a mordok camp he adjusted his belt he was already well past the witches hobble yawn had set out to warn her second thing after arriving at the outpost crazy or not no one deserved to be over run unaware by the undead even if it meant his last night at the outpost had been more eventful of all the questions raised after stirring the ashes of that old mountain foot out post one yawn did not want answered namely what happens if a caster rises he was certain knew exactly what the worse case scenario was there and it put a cold pulsing knot in his gut he thumbed the handle of the knife all he was allowed on this trial he felt naked with out his knives with out his mace and shield no armor no glaive no spear no javelin great wolfs tail not even a damn pouch full of stones he never thought hed say it but right now as he leapt the stream and paused a moment at the site of the burnt mordok camp but right now hed trade his future fangs for a sling and a pouch full of stones the air of the camp was still foul with months old scent of mordok blood gone over and ash even after the springs rains how happy hed been last fall how complete yawns boot ground a torn ragged bit of cloth into the the muddy rise life had been complete he had been deliriously happy out numbered thin on supplies told to watch and run if more came for the outpost and dead certain hed be joining his missing brothers in the great wolfs long house before the week was out fortnight at the most but he lived and from what was supposed to be his pillory for brawling the night of naming became his mark of distinction his moment in the light warrior in full all hed ever wanted done in just less then four days time his feet beat a steady pace along the ground solid ground what there was of it to be found steadily became narrower and patchy one needed to know how to step to keep pace not twist an ankle or spend the rest of the day tromping in wet boots the only thing more miserable then a day in wet boots was seeing the bottom of the poke yes his life had been full complete full of adventure and fights any youngling ulven would trade his fangs for and would be fool enough to make the trade for it too how had he found himself on this path had fewer been lost those first days of thunder and blood had his temper held long enough to challenge the three hed thrashed or best them during the trails perhaps if his mothers blood line was not touched by far sight and madness if magrat hadnt been with the bastards if putting down the dozens on the way back to onsallas had been enough to fill the void mourning had left if he hadnt risen so far so quickly and if doing so hadnt echoed hollow as an emptied mead barrel the brothers longfang were alike in many ways both took some aspect of their mothers stannrick in his steadfastness yawn in willingness to learn but the pair could not be more different in their rages and mourning stanrick dealt with it by screaming raging and sputtering a pipe or finding a warm bed not his own after making sure the great wolf winced from cries yawn carried that weight of death with him hollowed out a bit of his heart for those lost he saved it the way others save good drink and tobacco when things grew truly dire he let that weight in his heart fill him with bitterness sorrow but most disturbing of all joy joy that he could put one more body on the pyre that he might join his friends and family the point the point of this knife for this was an augment in his own mind and all arguments are knives doubled edge cutting both ways and coming to an end a point was this his path lead here for what ever reason divine providence was that what the syndar the yellow one had called the will of his gods could it not be the very course the very snare laid for him by gaia did not the goddess have a hundred thousand ways to bait the snares and paths she meant her children to find was his instinct not to find a new path he would not question it now magrat knew the means to kill the undead the undead were here the longfangs his pack devours maw the whole ulven race needed that knowledge foresight and visions ran on his mother side as did madness and on his fathers side decisiveness the will the be the first the make the leap into whatever need be dealt with and was that not a sort of madness was it not an ideal joining of these traits that he would be the first to think to ask of magrats ways to know the undead were a threat before the proof of it tried to cut him to ribbons after he hurled a stone half the size of his chest at the lich thank the gaias tender if rough hewn mercies it had only a pair of swords and not a pole arm the shade of the swamp grew deeper and the familiar plants gave way here less then an hour in and it was already darker then the pines at mid day the plants even those he knew grew strange gnarled some bleached and unwholesome looking strange and some how the twisted form of the familiar was more deeply unnerving then the new stranger looking plants here and there fallen trees slowly rotting some dotted with black gray and ashen white spiked  fungus were those the fungus hed seen around that forsaken outpost at the foot of the mountain had that merchant had less ale and drink on hand surely his head would like as not found it way to a pike if he were lucky after it been severed no tipman fungus unripened or otherwise another gifts of the colonists had it come over the gaping ocean with them something to ask magrat when he returned to file away for his return along with the questions for rill of the more familiar plants bleached and blackened relations until now plants had fallen into three categories useful dangerous and edible the last was the most favored though the second was heeded fully and it truth just a different sort of useful useful had meant he carried it back on his patrols to rill most often now it meant knowing more the portion hed not been apart of what could it treat how much did one need how to gauge the dosage how best to ply it when and where to look hed known but it simply been a chore before now ignorantly plucking gaias bounties and turning them over was not enough the hours ebbed and flowed strangely the deeper yawn went the the thicker became the darkness twilight beneath he leaves of twisted cops of trees foul smells rot and stagnating pools the air choked and thick moss and shade bleached grasses everywhere one might step a bit of bare stone or root here or there the occasional stunted rise with something else some times a higher pool of water ancient trees anyplace where stone root rock and earth were too tough to give out even under the duress of countless years of weathering with out the sky and sun the ever darkening twilight imperceptibility growing ever dimmer made a joke of time here was only darkness though it provided no comfort the trees strangled the winds the water made the air so humid that sweat came in rivulets the canopy provided no relief from the heat with time gone distance was the second victim with out time there was no way to know no true means to guess how far hed come well they dont call it the black for nothing as it turns out yawn muttered to the trees you dont belong here wolfing yawn whirled round on his feet the knife drawn in one clean motion eyes searching his ears tingling his forehead had that odd pinched sensation he had when hed stared down foes in combat when he had weapon tips pointed at him again came the voice joyful teasing mocking female turn back wolfing syndar can make the spirits to heel but not a pet not a human playing at being a wolfling the words shocked him did the spirits think his late coming fangs would shake him and yet it sent a chill down his spine dont listen his breath became labored heavy the air felt thinner d dont listen trying to break me to play with your skull yawn dont listen its just your mind filling in the dark yawn felt something cold lash over the back of his left hand the pain sang up his arm and he lashed out to the left with his knife catching nothing a warning wolfing who is not your last you can be made to bleed in more dire ways the voice was anxious eager it promised more suffering but it didnt want him to turn back whatever it was it wanted the threats it made to come to pass yawn wheeled about feeling the cut pulse his heart throbbing in his ears the blood screaming through his veins the blood flowing freely over his left hand a minute passed a second and yawn cursed to himself he scooped up dried leaves crushed them and packed the wound it wasnt an ideal poultice but it would stop the bleeding pain shot through his hand packing the wound worse then clean quick cut yawn held it fast and waited for the bleeding to stop he knelt there until the bleeding paused there was little else to do yawn panted sweat slicking his brow his tunic dried too quickly to soak through the material too thin to hold much liquid it kept his arms and chest if little else dry and just a touch cooler for it it had to be near night full but the swamp and its thick canopy trapped the days heat yawn thumbed the ring pommel of the knife he was already floating in and out of consciousness that on it own wasnt knew not being drunk battered or bleeding out while it was happening was his jaw ached the very bone had he been grinding his teeth the mocking voice echoed in his skull one phrase stuck there like a thorn between his shoulder blades wolfing who is not hed hunkered down trying to figure out what should come next when he started to hear and feel things around him voices snatches of sensations and thoughts none his own and always on the dip into something less then wakefulness it was as though until now hed been able to stroll on the surface of an ocean now that he knew it was there he could no longer stride over it no not over it hed been walking on a scum of ignorance now that hed broken it that he knew it would no longer hold him again the dip he felt as a peace of flotsam on a great swell bobbing and sinking he have to learn to swim or be pulled below all at once the sounds faded yawn felt still calm and cool he rose no reason to he just felt that surge the spirits waking stirring at the some one seeking seeking what why so so active was it him that an ulven sought to commune to deal and bind instead of command or was that the mordoks did no deal but corrupted and subdued yawn turned eyes open the darkness nearly complete turning listlessly eyes seeing this and that his head swimming though still that cool could be the black was eager for some one to try a different method a word floated in in between his ears like a wisp of smoke champion chosen what what was that damned human word retainer no all wrong all of them no the right word what was the right word did he have it or was his attempt to decipher the idea of it the suggestion in fact unmaking that wisp of an idea no important part of the trail trick no important now come back to it wait for the signs a sign yawn kept turning until he saw it a diminutive pulsing flickering light distant or diminutive sign it doesnt matter go his own instinct answered his feet hadnt waited for his mind to resolve it self and he already start lumbering slowly toward the now slowly growing orange flame yawn felt almost as if he was only watching himself act passively watching until his body needed to be jolted in this direction or corrected he was thinking about walking but also seeing himself walk from out side himself and seeing what he saw at onceyawn was thinking about the oddness of it all seeing himself both as if he were a bystander while knowing acting and seeing as himself if some one could manage such in combat to see as two what could that person manage a voice pulled him back into his body a voice that brought him back to himself and that filled him with rage how now fangless one how does will the great wolf find your heart when i tear it from you yilew greytides  as he heard the voice of the greytide hed thrashed shortly after the shaman incident at the onsallas outpost one turn of phrase entered yawns mind and dropped from his mouth crows luck curse explanation and exclamation in one with this the spirits meddling was a far lesser trouble down came the blackened sword yawns feet carried him side long to his attacker and danced to a bit more to his left circling sword side not good form not good at all the whistling cut found no purchase in its target but already its wielder ready the follow up strike yawns mind raced locking its to the lessons of his days as a youth in the training circles full body turn cross blow utterly devastation if it connects yawns left leg snapped up in a sharp short kick the ball of his foot checking yilews wrist and fore arm just as the greytide made ready to uncoil his strike a voice bellowed in his head like one might imagine the voice of gaia basso profondo female his instructor in wrestling kajal if you strike once then strike twice for the wolfs sake yawn pushed off his left foot hard felt the moss beneath give a bit torquing his hip into the turn combat holds many lessons among the first the young learn is this striking a skull with you bare hand hurts like hell there are much easier targets much more effective targets but yawn had done all kajal had asked of him shed taught him to harden his hands so as yawn threw was was the called by his people the crossing blow and by some of the colonists the iron cross others simply the right cross his fist flew for his foes jaw fangs and fury yawn cried as his fist plowed into yilews jaw and kept moving through the impact sounded like a stone against a side of beef as yilew fell his blade swept up and caught yawns right arm around the meat of the fore arm not a deep cut but testament to yilews swordsmanship most would not be able to wound a foe let along cut a decent wound as they fell yawn lashed out his left foot once twice three time a quick stomp another snap kick and second stomp to what portion of anatomy he did not know again up came yilew sword point aimed for yawns gut yawn feet drew him back and to his right so that all the blade found was a bit of his belt yew cannnt keepah dat up all nig th yawn translated roughly you cant keep that up all night yilew knew what yawn knew about fighting that fists hands fingers thumbs broke easily against a skull yawn smiled wide i can those of us that remember the face of the gaia can he wanted to explain how hard he had worked under kajal how for three weeks he couldnt open his hands how he couldnt even hold a fork with out pain how hed dipped into brine water and covered them still bleeding in the stinging poultices yilew rose suddenly stay with me stay here dont you go drifting off you havent earned a warriors death yet pup again kajal voice reaching out of his past to save him in the present that time shed been choking him was near senseless and finally the counter to the strangle came to him yilew thrust as he rose smooth efficient graceful and deadly with the whole of his weight behind his sword tip yawn again slid this time just a half step from where his stood to the his own left this time yilew meant to pierce his heart yawns left hand traped the grey tides sword arm a master strike one that should of killed him that should of even peirced his mail had he been wearing it but against a foe unencumbered by mail or shield just a half step too slow his right scooped his blade from its sheath gripped blade down another voice of his past guided him you have to remove the wing before you cook fowl no good eating there too string you put the blade here and pull stannrick teaching him to clean game birds the knife came down not cutting again the bare inner angle  yawn wrenched yilews sword arm straight and pulled the knife in and up sharp tendons gave way all that skill all of it destroyed in a single cut yilew screaming and failed his body turned traitor his good sword arm no longer obeying his will it couldnt yawn shoved yilew to the ground and straddled him he wanted to see his eyes when he put the light out of them wanted to know the look his foe had when he took all that was left or he decided to leave him half crippled in the middle of the black yawn near toppled over his foe when his eyes saw not yilew not greytide his foe smiled and he felt his knife arm go limp his hand drop the blade felt blood running down his sword arm he stared at himself older fanged and twisted wearing the greytides belt flag a thousand miles run a thousand more and you cant out run me i am you had he crippled himself his life as a warrior was it over no sword arm no shield arm no bow no spear no two hander stay here yawn kajal voice again the same choking feeling get out fight the spirits will hollow you out make you what you least want traitor onsallas will burn and your people die scattered and cowerin yawns left hand griped his foes tunic hard and he put the whole of his weight down again his forearm and across his dopples throat could you pummel or choke a spirit to death yawn would try would it mean his own end he just want the prattle to stop if it meant he stood before the great wolf today so much the better to die against a supernatural foe while trying to keep the whole of his people well so be it i am not you yawn spat his left hand screaming in pain as his improvised poultice gave way as he bled a fresh i dont know what spawned you or how you can be me or how we share the same wound but i am a long fang i have not forgotten the face of my mother or my sisters or my brothers sweat pouring down his back his foe sputtering for air  you you are dust you are rot you are nothing more then a stone in my path i will press you under heel as i step on the path that is all you are all you ever were and all you ever will be he felt the struggle go out of his foe felt the body convulse in its last desperate attempts for air and felt woozy greytide blade cuts why too shallow poison the world spun before his eyes going gray then black and red and at last naught but black  time with out a marker as distance beyond reckoning lost its meaning such it is with dreams yawns mind slid again through the black he was so damn sleepy his arms where heavy his feet lead he couldnt keep his head up he need to rise but only managed to sit up legs sprawled that was enough for now after all he was done it was over after all of that he was certain the great wolf would lend him some slack if at once to his feet to greet him certainly he wasnt the first warrior to have such problems did the mending happen before or after the great wolfs weighing of deeds a question hed never bothered to ask if not before surely more then one warrior has struggled to be presentable while less then whole even whole would not one find the transition disorienting how many sprang from battle and only saw another enemy he heard the waves again he was adrift not yet drowning though not yet swimming still he was drawing breath was that enough he let the waves take him it was pointless to fight an ocean with out a goal wasted energy fury against the darkness would do nothing more then tire him he let the water pull him where it would listened to the waters song it was peaceful restful apart from sting in his wounds and a slight coolness it was comfortable it even smelled pleasant he strained his ears he heard something not the waves not birds something in the distance he strained to hear anything more over the waves and water yawnrick yawnrick yawnrick shrieked a voice going from tenor to shrill alto a voice he thought of as gaias own yawnrick snapped up bolt straight eyes hazy full of terror and confusion he knew that voice it was the thing yawnrick feared more then death more then a straw death and more then the devours hell kajal kajal his teacher there she was all five eight of her light as a damn bale of hay but ever capable of breaking larger fighters in two and smiling while she did scars laced over her arms and hands too numerous to count the skin there like leather yawnrick winced but this was not the yawn you know this was yawn before hed become the warrior he would be before the days of blood and thunder before becoming a warrior in full echoed a hallow in his soul before hed even seen a syndar yawnrick was slight pale despite his time in the sun the only signs of his future sturdiness were the wolfings hands feet and joints which seemed just a size too large for his frame welcome back yawnrick i hope you enjoyed your day dream you dream up a way to kill with out paying attention or a wish do let me know have you yawnrick seldom if ever now at a loss for words had not yet found his voice then his mouth gaped for a second closed and he shook his head to kill with a wish a thought will who could manage that kajals eyes narrowed a smile on her lips well then maybe youll come up with something worth while during your laps yawnrick sighed his shoulders slumping as he started for the gate from the training circles yawnrick at her call young yawnrick stopped dead in his tracks twenty laps with the timber and the shield yawnrick briskly jogged to the racks and just as his hand gripped the first shield the double weighted shield yawnrick he bit his lip and scooped up the heavier shield a slot down the timber was a a hunk of a sapling six inches wide roughly four feet long he knelt and wrest the thing over his right shoulder struggled to rise and managed better then a trudge his packmates snickering behind him what are you lot giggling at he only has the rest of day to struggle alone you unfortunate pups are still stuck with me he started for the first corner the route would take him around the back wall then to the mid point look outs between here and the pines if he was lucky hed finish just after sun down oh yawnrick drop either of your burdens and i will have you running laps til trails he heard kajals call and winced as he started for the second corner sweat rolled down yawnricks shoulder his tunic matted he could feel his arms as a whole screaming aches where his tunics folds ground into his shoulder beneath the timbers weight last circuit last round he would not falter not now hed not give kajal a reason to smile that wolfs grin of hers his pace swayed tilting bobbing swaying nearly off balance exhausted hungry thirsty frustrated he came in sight of the gate all he needed to to was to make it to the racks he shuddered his back spammed his knees creaked and he could feel his feet throbbing in his boots he dropped the timber first and racked the training shield he could feel his muscles twitching he fought the urge to kneel or sit he closed his eyes standing gripped his hands together and rolled them back and forth trying to loosen up the tendons he knew better then to just collapse or be still after that why are you wasting my time yawnrick he snapped around on his toes hands up fists closed kajal glared at him pipe in hand a trail of dark gray smoke trailing from the corner of her mouth as she lifted the clay pipe to her lips and drew again the bowels ember growing bright casting her upper face in a red glow his hands dropped confusion filling his eyes why the hell had kajal picked a time like now to start asking questions of him kajal started towards him kajal did not move so much as seem to flow her movements quick smooth deliberate as mist lifting over a white cap and then just as seamlessly dropping back over its wake yawn did not see her hand rise kajal did not give warning signs of her strikes one moment she was closing the distance the next yawnricks head snapped aside and he tasted blood answer me pup why are you wasting my time your fighting in the circle is half hearted at best tell me yawnrick why are you still only half here i yawn started when kajals hand again raised from her hip and knocked his head back the opposite direction as her first blow had you cant be half a warrior yawnrick kajal gripped yawnricks shoulder hefting him by his tunic it gets your friends killed if wish to be anything else pup now is the time kajals voice did not strain this was not her instructors voice not the voice of command this was a soft deadly serious statement kajals eyes burned her hands were like steel yawnricks hands wrapped her griping at her hand from the outside of her grip and prying at her thumbs his foot shot between them in one motion yawnrick pushed planting his boot in kajals stomach and pushing as he pried open her grip at the thumbs it was an all or nothing bid kajal taken aback by his desperate gambit flew backward and as yawnrick fell back he lost sight of her all hed seen was her pipe spilling its smoldering contents before scrambling for his footing not fast enough kajal blind sided him as he rolled to hands and knees with her knee a smooth rushing shot that connect beneath his chin and sent him to his back he hadnt even the time to scramble again before kajal had him by the hair dragging him by it muttering curses this time he couldnt find a point to pry give up now pup become a farmer a fisher anything there is no warriors heart in your chest kajal spat as she threw yawnrick into the training circle yawnrick rolled twice but some how found his balance ending in a crouch no yawn managed his voice hoarse and he felt his lip split at the corner kajal smiled you cant even break a hold on your hair pup give up now become anything but a warrior have lots of fat plain straw wolfings with some happy ulven girl yawnrick felt his blood fever starting felt his rage clawing at his mind he choked it back he wanted to give in he wanted to lash out blindly but what good would berserk fury do against kajal no kajal she swept in yawnrick threw a jab which kajal turned aside easily her leg lashed out cutting off yawnricks side step as her free hand gripped his uncommitted shoulder with an easy turn of her hips she forced yawn off the ground and into the air with a quick shove she sent him backward sprawling across his back no sooner did yawnrick start to his feet then kajal leapt for him knee high down it it came yawnrick managed to catch her heel with his hand did he hear a crack dont be the bones giving not now damn it kajal glared down at him inching her weight onto her forward leg forcing yawnricks hand down toward his throat will you keep this up all night yawnrick i can think fast or youll be waking with the healers yawnrick shoved back giving it all he had kajal simply hopped turning mid leap her free foots ball aimed for his jaw yawnrick watch and time slowed he felt the tread connecting his skin being pulled his inner cheek tearing against his teeth the pain and blood and as he did yawnrick rose with all the strength he had sudden and smoothly and he saw kajals eyes go wide he forced her feet into air toppling her yawnrick slid form his back to his knees finding himself at her side his hand reached and fished for kajal tunic finding a hand full twisting as he rose on his knees right curled into a fist ready to rain blows on his teacher when kajals face changed half a moment more and hed of brought his fist down until kajal countered or  or what i killed my own teacher until i saw blood until kajal surrendered kajal laughed bright and full infectious and true again yawnricks face and eyes showed utter bewilderment did going gray drive kajal mad so youve fire enough it turns out enough yawnrick youve proven yourself if yawnrick bore ears as the wolves theyd of pinned themselves back he shook just a moments tremor the blood fever stalling its frenzied charge through his veins what he meant to open his hand he meant to but it held like a vise to the tunic i will make you a weapon yet yawnrick you needed to see what you could do ive seen it before those who dont realize all gaias children have means to fight none more so then her favorites i needed to see what you would do with you back to the wall yawnricks eyes narrowed and he pulled kajal closer by her tunic he leaned in perhaps a few inches why he spat kajals face showed neither concern nor deceit she smiled warmly her voice remained calm and a little sweet which disturbed yawnrick hed never heard kajal speak sweetly slowly she placed her hand over yawnricks forearm because i do not train fodder all ulven wish to die in service to their pack all warriors but i will not train useless idiots i will not train those better suited to labor then battle fools rushing head long in to the devours teeth names dying on the wind yawns face softened but his grip remained but kajal continued ignoring yawnrick nor would i suffer those unwilling to fight for their own lives i train pups to wolves not armored cattle yawnricks hand finally obeyed his will and started to open good yawnrick fetch my pipe with out a thought perhaps dazed from his blood fevers abatement yawn turned limped toward the pipe bent at the waist and scooped it up he hadnt felt himself drop to his knee so hard kajal was already sitting up and opening her poke yawn knelt wincing having some how forgotten his abused knee kajal shoved her poke into his free hand i will make you an ulven yawnrick but first your learning to smoke no mead until after training and youll be staying late yawnrick your father had skill with his hands if youre just a spec wiser i can teach you things he never learned yawn stared dumbly at the open poke and pipe fill the damned pipe pup yawnrick started dont force it just stuff in a bit not hard thats it the lamp candle will work for a lite and you will wish for a farmers life before you make it to trails yawnrick she smiled that wolves smile at her student again as yawnrick managed to lite the pipe wrong of course but the pups brain had to be scrambled after that kick and as yawn coughed youll get used to it but dont you dare drop my pipe puparam with these words that i inscribe upon paper in the inks of the prophets of the four gods i begin a book that may one day find a place within the pages of the holy books of the kaerim though our home may be long gone and the sands of the deserts far behind us though our people may no longer exist it is my duty to write the words as the prophets once did this tale may not be true but it is true enough to instruct those who come after me and that sort of truth is enough to guide any soul before the four gods i must confess that the oaths of my people have been transgressed but as was said in the book of ulbrana man may doubt but only the gods may judge their souls it was with human madness that i struck a mhordak and it is with human piety that i confess that to all who follow these words in these actions i did judge this being and i did break the holiest of tenants of the kaerim that one shall harm no living creature though my blade was dull the creature did fall and die at the hands of those seeking to defend the outpost of the wolves my actions were made in human folly and for those i hope to atone as mhaker did argue with alnulpun when he gave us the laws so do i intend to consider these thoughts should this drive me away from the truth then atonement shall never come and i shall remain away from the guidance of those who protect the kaerim i pray for a sign that i am wrong and that the grace of the four gods resides in this distant land that i may once again know the stars in the skies and know that the minds of the prophets guide me it is written in the book of the laws that no living creature may be of evil pure that all judgment that man may give is absolute or true and that only the gods may know what evils lay within the hearts of those who choose to follow those paths we were ordered to destroy only the khaltam those who walk forth from the shadows of death and mock the embrace of ulweitwe and that all other life is sacred these things are known and they are truth but what truth may be found in new lands what signs lay before us to discover the poets of the sky are not of my people they are those of a different folk the ylvhen wolves of this new home what guidance may the kaerim draw from these poets who sing of battle honor and the evils of the mhordak though i feel no doubt that the four gods reside here in the glories of this nature and the land where water runs freely i question why i am here the calling to this land was sudden and came only when the prophecies told us that our people must look away from our home and seek the light of the west so that we might find the everchanging eye these words meant little to me when i left with my dhara but in time i feel these signs will become clear i know not if my people survive we have always walked the deserts taken the paths that the dwellers of cities shun and exterminated the corpsebreath of the land it is our duty and duty may never be eschewed if we are the last then we shall write one final book of these events to stand with the others our guiding words were lost in flesh but not in the heart and it is there that they truly matter through all this doubt i find the question of the mhordak appear as a wind in the desert relentless wearing eroding all that stands in its path what are these creatures why do they hate all things are they as unnatural as the khaltam a sign is needed and a sign i shall seek with words of anger i promised a good man that i would make him the poison that steals the strength of any creature with words of rage i did cry for their blood with a mind of hate i struck another being in calmer times in rational times these words would be forgotten easily forgiven as the folly of a mortal full of doubt and restlessness but in this time where all is new and little can be understood i must consider them in the coming days i will ruminate upon these words and seek the signs of the mhordak if the four themselves grant me wisdom to see through the illusions of the world then i shall arrive at truth not the truth of a story fragile and weak but the truth of certainty i have seen some of these signs the words i copied at the time of the wolfs closing jaws were of an evil that no being should play a part in inscribed on the bones of a creature longdead a dishonor to its spirit and a corruption of its form this speaks of an evil so pure that it may beg the flame of ulbrana that this horror might be cleansed from the world as is written in the great book of alkhara when he spoke of the rites of death and the role the kaerim must play in them dishonor not the bones for they become the grains which rattle the dunes adorn them with symbols most pure and righteous and watch them for signs of evil cleanse them with fire and give them no chance to rise again the soul lives in the bones for without them no creature may move this evil is beyond that of the betrayers the falseled to condemn a creature to such evil is beyond any rational thought still i remain uncertain with these meditations those who come after me may derive guidance i have spotted the stars now i must chart them and discover the meanings within ulweitwe supports me alnulpun nourishes me alkhara surrounds me ulbrana protects me this i know for the signs of the four surround me in this land of plenty should a sign come i shall be ready and these words will be inscribed so that i may not forget may they someday join the rest of the books if only in the hearts of my people though i am filled with doubt at my actions one truth remains and it is certain a promise was made to the ironhanded wolf this promise made in anger still rings true after the rage has fled should the serpent come so shall it be transformed into a dagger to plunge into the heart of evil so is written the first book by the hand of aram askhani imbranaweithe rnalta isaldinoreftim son of the kaerimthey can not stand up to us in open battle astrid they couldnt when we landed and they cant now they arent trained or equipped to fight lions toe to toe but their skirmishers will tear us to pieces if we have a long march theyve lived and fought in these lands for centuries they have adapted their tactics to their ancestral foes well the masters of the order were all studying a map of mardrun not even the ulven had fully mapped the continent but that which was known was on display before them on such knowledge did the future lie mordok and ulven are worthy foes folkvar as i recall you have the scars to prove it i healed them i should know ill bring the tea the runemaster retrieved the steaming pot and poured cups for her compatriots believe me i have not forgotten i did not mean to diminish mordok or ulven battle skill or ferocity just that we fight differently neither has ever faced tight formations of heavy infantry supported by skilled archers and engines have any of you ever known either race to use a siege machine his question was met with silence exactly ulven towns arent built to withstand a siege either their warriors will fight off the mordok raid or they break out before the supplies vanish its simply the way things have been done here raid followed by counterraid ive talked to enough ulven among our allies to know that the last time they faced an army of mordok was decades ago it rampaged through ulven lands for at least a season until enough warriors were gathered to stop it the simple fact is that the ulven dont wage war not by our definition folkvar takes a sip of the tea and traces the thin lines on the map raid counter raid repeat and so on they dont besiege the mordok they dont fight pitched battles their history is one long skirmish we force them to fight us our way we attack their towns surround them and reduce them if they try and bait us we ignore them as long as we keep our supplies and support troops in the center of the column and dont enter any terrain with an ambush here sign they will have to face us to stop us we can repair our armor and heal ourselves on the move as long as we have food he moves to the part of the map that signifies the lands of the greytide the most greytide will be able to do is slow us down and save their people noncombatants may flee but most of their warriors will want to stand and defend their homes we will crush them in a pitched battle and we will give them no other choice he takes another sip of tea and tips over a few wooden markers on the map this is all irrelevant the war will not stay between us and greytide if it happens it will be all the colonies and all the ulven with the mordok thrown in for good measure the dead never crushed me because i could trade land for time falling back to a better position retreating when necessary we simple dont have any room to maneuver here the land we have is home we have nothing to trade for time if this becomes a race war they will simply isolate us and starve us out not being able to break open our walls doesnt mean they cant win astrid looks up from the map well warmaster arent you just a harried looking young messenger perhaps ten bows and stumbles over to master anundars place in the corner the boy hands a letter over bows again and leaves anundar open the letter and begins to read his expression turning darker and darker the runemaster steps forward first well what is it ill just read it a lich has been sighted between new aldoria and new hope a old man calling himself boomhowler managed to warn a small trading post and fight off an attack mordok raised but killed quickly stopped a ritual the beast was performing lich escaped current location unknown ulven know the masters shared a stunned silence for some time after a time folkvar stood up and looked at astrid when do i march and with how many forty lions and as many eagles as can be spared all assets in the area now have a new focus send word toeveryone including aedan his mission is still his priority now we must have peace with the ulven its not against who we thought but we march make sure all of them know never again not here not againbryech savagefang bryech walked into the village with kreiger he stood close to him as this was the first time in a year he had come into contact with people other than the bloodfangs since he left his home in search of his father the noises were not strange to him as he has spent the first few years of his life in a town much like this youre going to need a sword kreiger grunted at him with no emotion in his voice as he handed him a coin purse heavy with silver this should be more than plenty dont buy anything else but a sword and make sure its crafter is respectable bryech took the coin purse and stowed it in his belt which was just a piece of twine which was fraying slightly i have some business to attend to so ill meet you back here at nightfall dont be late and with that he was off to some corner of the outpost bryech looked around he was confused he hadnt experienced contact with other ulven for quite sometime let alone humans and syndar he searched the outpost and found a blacksmith he was an ulven but bryech still had a hard time conversing with him at first but the swords looked sturdy and deadly so he bought one and went of to the place where kreiger told him to meet the sun horse hadnt even brought the sun to the middle of the sky bryech climbed a tree just outside of the outpost and listened to the sounds of nature and enjoyed the peacefulness of it all he remembered his best days of his early travels when it was just him and the animals the deer roaming the wilds and the wolves howling at the moon he then remembered the winter and the horrors of the storms it brought with he shook off the daydreams and searched back into reality he still had plenty of time to kill so he went out into the wilderness to explore before he began his travels with kreiger after about twenty minutes or so he stopped walking and climbed a tree nearby trying to get a better view of his surroundings his new sword was impossible to hold in his twine belt so he held the handle and climbed nearly cutting off his fingers twice in the process once he reached a decent height he looked around he couldnt have been twelve feet off of the ground but he could see quite far his moment of calm was interrupted by a loud thwack in the brush behind him he strained his ear to hear whoever it was dammit where did it go it was a womans voice he watched the ground around him and an ulven women appeared out of the brush she looked to be about the same bryech she had a bow strung across her back and about six arrows with her she walked forward a few feet and then looked around she seemed to be angry and bryech could tell why there was a red mark running across her face damn thorn branches she grumbled she started walking again bryech guessed she was looking for something most likely hunting bryech decided to follow her she went deep into the woods and bryech was sure they were moving away from safety and into danger eventually she stopped and sat on the ground and started eating some dried meat bryech was about to climb down for a closer look when he heard a twig snap in the distance his eyes shot toward the noise and there in the middle of the valley the girl and bryech had traveled into was a small group of mordok maybe only three of them but they were well armed and moving towards the girl bryech felt an anger swell inside of him the mordok had constantly hunted him during his time alone and he had nearly died many times at their hands they were the only beings in the world whom he hated more than his former pack he looked at the mordok and then at his new sword the ground will flood with their blood bryech growled bryech climbed down swiftly from the tree and made his way to the girl she still hadnt picked up on the mordok or bryech but that was about to change bryech quickly but quietly made his way over to the girl he walked behind her and put a hand over her mouth she then reacted by biting him in the hand he grimaced but did not let go as she started thrashing and bryech growled at her there is a pack of mordok within shooting distance so i need you to be quiet she stopped thrashing and he released her looking at the damage she had done to his hand you couldve told me in a better way you know she said as she took her bow off of her shoulder and nocked an arrow well it worked at keeping you quiet for the most part bryech replied whats the plan she asked as she tried to get a view from the brush you distract them and when they surround you i come in from behind and start a counterattack he replies thats a terrible plan you know that right she replied yeah ive had worse he replied crouching down getting a view of the mordok as they searched the area no doubt having found their scent name one plan that is worse than this one the girl growled as she readied herself to run me a medium sized rock and three mordok bryech replied the girl ran out of the bush at breakneck speed as bryech watched from the brush she didnt move them very far but she did wound one of them about ten yards away she was surrounded and they were slowly moving in bryech started running toward them the mordok noticed him too late as he rammed his sword into the back of ones knee when it dropped down he put his left hand on its chin and twisted its neck with a fluid motion it didnt kill it right away but it did distract it while bryech followed up with his new blade finishing it a mordok to his right pulled an axe over his shoulder to strike but an arrow hit him in the chest and before he could react a the girl swung her bow and made solid contact with the creatures face it stumbled swinging blindly the girl rolled out of the way of the sword bryech jumped forward driving his own sword into the mordoks chest another one of the beasts grabbed him from behind the mordok stabbed bryech in the side with a knife bryech let out growl of anger and slammed the back of his head into the mordoks face causing it to stumble its grip loosened and bryech jumped free and turned to face the mordok blood was running from its nose and from the hole in bryechs side bryech ran forward and tackled the mordok he pinned it down and started punching in a wild rage the creature clawed at him and bit at him they struggled until the girl darted up ending the struggle with her dagger you can stop now i think its dead the girl commented he stood up and looked around and he saw the bodies of the mordok lying motionless the girl pulled an arrow from one of the corpses lets get some wood we need to burn these bastards bryech said panting the two warriors stood in front of the great fire currently burning the bodies of the mordok they killed my names bryech by the way bryech said holding out his hand to the girl echo nice to meet you they gripped arms like true ulven and stared at the pyre the sun was beginning to reach the far horizon and would soon set the fire died down and the ash was being blown up by the wind echo interrupted the silence you fought well out there thanks you too bryech replied grimacing as the wound in his side throbbed it had stopped bleeding for the most part and the knife didnt seem to have any poison on it so he would bandage it later the situation was awkward for him he hadnt had much interaction with people for a while so conversation was awkward especially with this new friend they walked back to the outpost just as night was falling until next time i guess bryech said yeah ill see you again im sure hopefully were still on the same side echo replied they went their separate ways but bryech had a feeling theyd meet again the days events had given him all the proof he needed that his new life was a good one that today was a new dayylsa stormherald delivered to raskolf vakr via borrowed messenger falcon the day after wayward inn caught fire dearest brother of my mate we are well but no longer in the place you left us it has burned to the ground sadly with my favorite sword and mug inside it i hope this letter reaches you before you reach the wreckage our mutual friends returned to us with word of clan grimwards decision shortly before greytide came to deliver the message themselves there was a battle with our newlydeclared enemies we had superior numbers but inferior armor and they knew not to come to the open where we could surround them it was only through the efforts of a very skilled healer and a certain clever little girl that we survived the healer was unable to tend to us all before the second wave broke through our walls however we had to flee to a neighboring village leaving our previous shelter in flames the news of war is grave news indeed but not all hope is lost two of the former sunsoaked pack chose to stand by our side in battle as well as one who was nearly sent to meet the wolf by his own pack when he chose not to follow their path our somewhat bolstered party will make for the same village that you were headed to as of your last parting with our mutual friends once our wounds heal enough to travel the distance if you are not there the company will most likely break for now i will take your family to the lands of my born pack  we will be safe there and my kin can spread word to our allies faster and more securely than any other be well your cloudspotter ps if you see our quiet friend please be sure to tell him of the sunsoaked ones loyalty to us there is unpleasant history between him and them and he departed before our enemies arriveddrifa just wanted to go home wherever that was the refugees flight from the burning shell of the wayward inn had begun to develop a nightmarish quality in her mind the line between reality and memory blurring with each passing hour she looked over at her friend lucia who sat blinking wearily into the fire still dressed in the tattered remains of her finery in her minds eye she could see the stark horror on her friends face as the greytides came after them the afterimage of lucias spell seared blue into her thoughts like a lightning strike hair stood up on the back of her neck as memory took her the sounds of battle filled her ears the ringing of steel on steel the nauseating crunch of steel striking bone the pursuing packs mocking laughter the hoarse bellow of the greytide turncoat rogar shadowfang as he ordered her to run to leave to not turn back no matter what she heard she did what she was told as she stumbled down the brushcovered hill into the marsh something changed in her something buried deep within shifted and she could run no longer tears welled up spilling down her cheeks leaving pale streaks through the grime rage followed swallowing her fear she called out her challenge refused to run any farther she turned with every intention of murdering her pursuers dropping her leather toolbag and gripping her weapons with sweatslick hands there were too many and drifa was no swordsman she could feel the icy rush of the swamp water as she lost her shoe in the mire and the numbing terror that seized her heart as she felt them closing in drifa raised her borrowed sword harsh laughter as they paced around her fallen body enjoining her to call for help call her companions back to save her she screamed her refusal her voice breaking as the blood seeped from her wounded arm then rogar seemingly back from the dead helping her bandaging her and another frantic flight through the forest lucia dodging and casting her spells the greytides pursuing cornering them again drifas lessthanable hands raising her weapons once more in mindless terror a desperate contact and then blood so much blood pouring from her chest with each breath as she lay in the mud shaking hands wrapping bloody bandages in a vain effort to stem the tide and rogar again fighting off his former packmates despite his many wounds giving her time to get to her feet and stumble on stumble until they were far enough into nightriver territory to keep the greytides from following them she could feel her heart pounding in her chest her breath coming in short sharp gasps each inhalation like shards of ice piercing her lungs her limbs felt weighed down dead weight dragging her down into the marsh with each labored step it would be easier to lie down and die but she was too stubborn to do so she struggled on fresh blood welling through the bandages on her chest and arm her shoes and skirts soaked with mud and swamp water and worse she couldnt stop none of them could stop not until they reached nightriver territory and the welcome sight of a village the weary smiths apprentice blinked and the memory faded slowly letting reality in there were no greytides here not yet it was over for now beside her were the rest of the survivors tended by members of the nightriver clan badly wounded and near dead from exhaustion her compatriots sat staring into the fire with the bemused expressions of those who had found themselves gifted with lives they had thought to lose across from her the two goldmanes sat leaning against one another their eyes shadowed and their faces grimy drifa was thankful shed aided the taller one after her honor duel with harlok there would be plenty of death soon enough if clan grimward had their way there was no need to rush it along shed liked them in the inn before the longfangs returned with their dire news even if they were kind of quiet and she was glad that she could still like them honor duels pfah an excuse for more fighting drifa thought as she looked away from the flames and into the darkness of the trees the dead were walking walking and killing and making more dead walk and the ulven were fighting amongst themselves how unproductive was that the ulven needed every warm body hale and hearty to fend off the undead hordes and the mordok that were sure to follow scavengers she turned her head and spit into the fire causing it to sizzle nothing but scavengers mordok fed off the unfortunate like vultures only more unnatural the unclean ones were a blight upon gaia and she could easily see them using this situation to their advantage no they would have to put aside all of this war nonsense if they wanted to survive the people of the wolf could not afford chaos and disunity either amongst themselves or with their allies the humans and syndar so far drifa had met more good colonists than bad shed liked the human what was his name william that was it from vandregon hed come to the wayward inn with the clanless ulven venator to try to rally an army she felt bad that she hadnt recognized the clanless one after the skirmish with the greytides but with blood thick in the air filling her nostrils and the shock of the attack shed been turned all kinds of widdershins shed actually thought he was a greytide at first how embarrassing on the tail of that thought an uncomfortable idea began to push its way to the forefront of her brain she tried to squelch it but it kept popping up like an excited puppy that couldnt sit still after a brief internal struggle she let it up examined it and shuddered drifa blackfrost was going to have to use a sword dear gaia she was going to have to try to learn to fight effectively or else she was going to be a liability the watchwolves could ill afford after years of avoiding wielding a weapon the thought made her cringe her cheeks flushed in embarrassment and she scrubbed one dirty hand over her face to hide it they didnt give her a weapon and for good reason drifa was more likely to cut off her own foot than damage an opponent she had all the elegance of a drunken cow and about the same mass but somehow she had to turn that inebriated bovine into a murder machine and do it quickly or else she would find herself at the mercy of other ulven who would either aid her or kill her neither option seemed very appealing she already owed her life to the greytide turncoat and the idea of that debt being given to even more people shamed her her life wasnt worth that much she coughed bloody foam springing to her lips she wiped it away absently lost in her thoughts as the fire burned down and one by one her compatriots were led away to their rest by nightriver healers patiently she waited until the fire burned down to coals and her thoughts turned to sleep beneath all of her worries her thoughts and her memories was a deepseated almost subconscious fear that all the treaties with the colonists of newhope couldnt banish what if her people were being used what if the humans were manipulating them turning them on each other like feral dogs making their goal of conquering mardun that much easier what if clan grimward was rightlucia coinin for as long as lucia could remember the ulven people had been at peace with one another sure thered been a squabble here and there but nothing more her mother the infamous brigh had made sure she knew how to wield a sword like any true ulven but lucia had never dreamed not even in her darkest nightmares that one day she would raise her hand to another ulven as she sat by the fire still nursing her wounds from that day her mind drew her back into the swampridden forest shed fallen behind by no fault of her own cut off from the fleeing group by two of the greytide warriors shed hidden then much to her shame but she knew that if she didnt they would show her no mercy shed thought they were moving on was almost certain of it when the last remaining warrior the leader so it seemed spotted her through the trees she could still hear the bloodlust in his battle cry still feel her blood run cold as he rushed towards her with murder in his eyes shed done it then used her newly trained powers to push him back into a tree stunning him and stopping his rush shed kept pushing him over and over again back into the swamp but when her mana was finally depleted shed felt lost and utterly helpless until as she looked into the eyes of the advancing greytide she recalled the words of her mother you cannot always be prepared for battle you can try but you will eventually fail in these times of need look to your mother look to gaia for aid let her be your sword  shield she will protect you in your darkest hour never forget she is always with you and lucia did exactly as her mother had said moving to put one of the forests trees between herself and her enemy shed used it took up gaia as a shield to protect her from him then the tree blocked the path of his spear helped her dodge his repeated attempts to skewer her eventually she grew tired and could no longer dodge his blows it was only then that she cried out for help but it was too late and the greytide leader stabbed her in the stomach the only time hed touched her that day finally drifa  the wounded greytide turncoat two of her group who had also fallen behind caught up to her and kept him away from her long enough for her to run slowly dripping blood onto the forest floor shed made it to the village but just barely ahead of the greytide attackers shed cursed them that day screaming to gaia for vengeance shed never done it before never truly damned anyone before she didnt even know if it would work but she did know one thing for certain never in her life had lucia put so much hatred into her words it burned in her blood at this very moment her stomach aching in remembrance of the greytides blade they would pay for what theyd done theyd pay dearly she would see to it personallyraskolf vakr dear priestess ravensmark i regret to inform you that the portents you read on the winds from the west were true the colonists have indeed brought their doom with them hungry ghosts walk on mardrun i have not only seen these abominations with my own eyes but they have tasted my steel they are formidable foes and much faster than they look they must be burned quickly or they will recover from even the most grievous wounds they are led by a powerful spellcaster who is called the lich we tracked it and confronted it in combat but it used foul sorceries to escape i know that my past disgrace forbids me from recommending any strategic or tactical advice to the council of elders but perhaps you my priestess may suggest that we dispatch the eyes and the ears of the watchwolves to the west in force the hungry ghosts will have difficulty finding bodies in our lands thanks to the grace and wisdom of our sacred traditions but i fear that the portents you sensed on the west wind could also be something yet to come perhaps from the sea also my priestess i was thinking perhaps you may consider making a motion to form an elite interclan war pack with the mission of traveling west and recruiting the most stalwart warriors from across the ulven nation in these most troubling times the need for unity is greater than it has ever been in several lifetimes it is for this reason that i was hoping that perhaps you could recommend that this pack include not only the best of the ulven nation but representatives from the humans and syndar as well please forgive me if i have overstepped my bounds but i was humbled tonight like i have not been since the day i became your warder we know nothing of these hungry ghosts and we will not be able to fight them by ourselves we are a proud people but i of all ulven warriors now and ever know firsthand how foolish pride can be i know the damage it can do tonight when the situation was bleak a frightened and desperate group of people looked to me for guidance and leadership i addressed the situation in the most logical way and made a sound decision in the best of judgment it was the wrong decision and it almost cost us our lives i made the wrong decision because i dont understand this new enemy and we as a people will not learn everything there is to know until it is too late we cannot stand alone tonight i learned something about the colonists yes these humans and syndar carry their doom with them they failed their people and made terrible mistakes in the past but as you once told me my beloved priestess some things can only be learned the hard way in new aldoria i told the crown prince that i didnt understand humanity now i do they are like me we must stand together it is our last hope your faithful servant raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolvesaeden haleth vonhorst and why didnt your friends send word back captain von horst aedan von horst stood opposite the masters of the order separated from them by the map covered table that dominated the orders command chamber i dont know master astrid but it was probably the weather paviken was beset by fierce storms most of last month and the owner of the towns messenger hawks was unwilling to risk his birds in the gale its entirely possible they tried to send word and it simply didnt get through thank you for your report captain you are dismissed aedan saluted smartly and performed a sharp facing movement after he had left warmaster folkvar and runemaster astrid leaned down to study the maps upon the table scout master anundar looked on from the shadows im glad he didnt make it to the peace summit with the grimwards said the warmaster were going to need all the trained men we have in the coming days true enough chuckled anundar though i would be curious to know how many grimwards he would have taken with him had he been there if the cub could learn to control his fury remarked the runemaster he would be a good lion frankly im not even sure why hes a captain but thats a debate for another day need i read this next report or can i assume that our troops have had no luck finding the beast folkvar removed his cloak and tossed it onto a chair i expected it to have minions enough that it would aggressively hunt us like these abominations did on faedrun but instead it retreated back into lands controlled by the mordok we dont have enough men to risk such a venture so i pulled my lions back apparently the mordok dont like the beast any more then we do and are keeping it in check the eagles that marched out with me stayed in the area to keep us informed i think we should use this opening while we can concentrate our forces against our new foes he dragged the map showing grimward and greytide lands over to his side of the table and started tracing roads and rivers with his fingers they have turned what could have been a nightmare scenario into something manageable they even managed to attack four other clans and give us allies as far as wars go it could have been much worse anundar was suddenly by the fireplace retrieving the whistling teapot and filling everyones cups no one had seen or heard him move but the other masters were used to that i agree master folkvar but isnt the lich our top priority the beast is beyond our grasp for now said folkvar all we can do is watch and wait for an opportunity as dangerous as he is we simply do not have the resources to hunt for him and defend ourselves from the ulven at the same time grimward and greytide are the more immediate problem we need a way to even the odds a bit anundar reclaimed his seat in the shadow i may be able to help with that he said sipping his tea two of the local ulven clans the bluefaces and bonecrunchers have pledged their support theres badblood between them and grimward that goes back generations their clans are small but they know the area very well and have an axe to grind they want in the runemaster began to say something but anundar raised his had into the light i have even better news he said they agreed to help my eagles learn some new tricks to even the odds in the woods a bit they also passed on a grimward weakness for us the chamber was silent anundar grinned and calmly sipped his tea spit it out you ass shouted the runemaster anundar took his time with his tea and casually raised a hand to gesture against the impatience of the other masters grimward has no defense against attacks from the water he said finally none our warships could operate with impunity the warmaster leaned over the map and rubbed his chin thoughtfully can they run shallow enough to use the rivers our newest vessels are aldorian in design they could run upon a wet sponge really  a week later survivors from a small fishing village began to trickle into neighboring grimward towns they told a strange tale of how one peaceful morning was destroyed by flaming rocks coming from the morning haze they told of how soon after the barrage heavily armored humans bearing the sigil of a white lion on a red tabard came marching out of the mist as if from the lake itself the towns garrison fought bravely but was disorganized and caught completely by surprise they fell with glory any who surrendered were allowed gather some supplies and leave as the column filed out of the town they watched it burn the humans torched it all crops homes even the windmill was toppled and the cistern filled with rubble the greatest insult was the towns founding stone placed generations ago by the first settler the mordok had never managed to destroy or befoul it but the invaders saw its significance they built a fire around it and then splashed it with cold water cracking it asunder as they retreated the refugees passed pickets of ulven and humans further out in the woods the men wore no sigils but the ulven had blue warpaint on their faces the bluefaces had sided with the colonists against their own kind many of the refugees had also been given a slip of paper by the men all the slips showed three crude drawings of grimward clan leader haygreth and father aegeus in profile the first was of the priest offering his hand to haygreth in friendship the second showed haygreth cutting the old man down in cold blood the third drawing showed a burning town and in the center was haygreths broken body with a human warrior standing over it the human was depicted wearing a lions tabard and holding the battle standard of the order the triumphant knight was flanked by colonists and ulven holding many banners all standing together the bottom of the slip had the following messages written in common trade languages and ulven your leaders attacked a mission of peace thus bringing this doom upon you we will not stop until those butchers are brought to justice for their crimes spread the word to your people that if they surrender they will be treated well and not harmed  haygreth grimward face us with what little courage you didnt use to kill a defenseless old man dont forget your pet greytide either you know where to find us yawn longfang magrat farwalker stanrick longfang the mind is a weapon the thought was still new to yawn sure he understood the mind affected the body had learned to stare horror and terror down and smash its skull in response rather then run for dear life screaming that he understood the body was a weapon training was it maintenance all weapons needed maintenance scour the rust from the metal add a little oil to keep the wood and steal bright and keep the rust off check the handles fitting the hilt the head int he case of maces and the pommels fit a little polishing never hurt keeps the wood bright protects it from wet rot magrat had knowledge was a fierce archer and a good friend yawn would learn all he could of the lost he would try to learn to call on the spirits and if it failed it would not be because a longfang warrior could not put his own mind to heel he would not fail for lack of effort on his part he sat cross legged on the cool matted grass of the outpost slowed his breathing keeping it deep and even closed his eyes and tried to let his mind empty felt the sun warm his tunic heard the wind through the grasses for a time he swore he could feel the earth itself turning the grass beneath him and there his mind slipped his will the grass burnt in places slick in places with the blood and gore of ulven and mordok alike gunthers screams as he was carried off thrashing and biting yawn clenched his fist despite himself he trembled with rage of see the knife seeing rill the intend mark the mad rush to break the hand the held it and knowing he was too far to make the difference of his fellow youngling diving between knife and rill the cut he took across his upper arm from having lost sight of his opponent the sound of stanrick sword find it soft marks of zucs glaive raining heavy blows across shield and flesh alike hewing anything foolish enough to come into reach rills own blade and shield of rill lashing out with both equal breaking and cutting any target that came near of the sensation of the mace and shovel in his hand the maces thud the shovels clang finding the throat with it dull blade soft bits vulnerable to its point the impact singing back along the handles to his arms the fury that filled his blood the battle rage the need to break to maim to kill what had hurt what had taken from his pack and yet killing maiming did nothing to fill the void no matter how many fell under his cudgels no matter how many foe he fell it would never bring back those lost  magrat kept a carful yet discreet watch on yawn to be honest she had never trained another and she had no intention of screwing this one up she had made a bargain with one of the local spirits to keep an eye on him and when the little thing tugged on her consciousness she went to find him immediately she found him partially hidden in the grass she watched his hands grip and tremble at nothing and the little spirit gave her an idea of where he had gone she paused remembering when her teacher had pulled her from her mind and what he had said to her she waited a moment before laying a hand on his shoulder and called his name softly yawn he snapped out of his reverie and for a moment she saw the rage and the pain in his eyes the path to the world of the spirits is through ourselves she said quietly and without preamble sitting down next to him and facing the swamp as he did we must first navigate the mire that is our hearts and spirits before we may come out the other side we must learn truths about ourselves and our pasts and these truths will not be comfortable but they give insights to ourselves of where we were and where we are going and why we are going there when we stand before our totems for the first time we are naked they will see all of our anger our pain our rights and wrongs our joys and sorrows if we are not at peace with ourselves they will know and when they test you you will fail she toyed with a strand of grass absently will you share with me what you saw  yawn eyes stayed wild for a few moments he looked down i was here the night of the attack the night before the bastards arrived he swallowed i was lashing out reliving the fight the lose the younling we lost when he threw himself between rill and the dagger if id been a half step faster or thrown the shovel maybe but not even in the vision do i change my actions gunther carried off screaming and i want to make them pay i want to hurt his eyes equal parts fury and sadness i want to break maim gouge and crush i want them to feel all theyd inflicted and more and i want to feel nothing while i do it but the mace and shovels vibrations shocking back up my arms i want to pile the corpses though i know no matter how many i kill no mater how many i burn it will no more put breath back into our lost then my regrets yawns shoulders relaxed his hand stayed closed in fists but he was no longer clenching  stanrick was sitting on the other side of the wall had been for some time smoking his pipe he was hearing every word knew what was happening and was torn yawn was his brother a longfang he had also felt his pain the snow had melted and stanrick tried to help his brother but now he was losing him not in death but rather his spirit if he kept down the path he was heading the great wolf would not know his name but what kept his silence was magrat if the pack knew she was teaching him he didnt want to think about it that dumb whelp all he thinks of is him self he mumbled under his breath perhaps if his eyes would change or his fangs come in then he would come to his right mindstanrick longfang stanrick had been wandering for days it had been two weeks since he had split off from the rest of the longfangs magrat and yawn had headed off to the out post and he didnt know where the others had gone off he had decided to take the lone way home and see to it that the outlying villages knew of the now very real civil war his leg had healed nicely but hurt still even more so before the rain he had spent a week at a farm in a clearing that was home to some humans that went out to live on their own what a sight it must have been for the farmer a man named gavros seeing the blood soaked ulven limp out of the woods at the time his wound had reopened and he had fought at least a dozen mordok on his way the man was kind enough to let him rest and repair his armor his wife even washed the blood out of his tunic all this in exchange for some help at the farm splitting wood now he was not far from home maybe a day or two and he stopped keeping count of the mordok he had killed burning each one still not sure if they would get back up was it all a trick he didnt know what to think the walking dead had been on his mind a lot as of late before they went their own ways imara had told him about her experiences with the undead the more he heard the more he respected the humans and syndar he called friend truly if this plague was removed from gaias earth then the deeds would ring in the great wolfs ears but this civil war was madness not all the humans were good but to declare an out right war on them was foolish his blade had tasted the blood of human mordok syndar undead and now ulven in numbers that he cared not to keep track of he hated it the human syndar ulven part anyway killing mordok was just part of life and the dead needed to stay dead but in his older age his thoughts now thought of the little farm cows chickens maybe a few of them horses that the humans had brought over he could grow tobacco and other crops hunt in the woods and fish off the stream only kill a few mordok a week the great wolf would not forget his deeds he could see it now a small cabin a little barn dead mordok burning using the ash in the fields ash was great fertilizer maybe one day he would have his little home for him and his mate but now he had other things to take care of he saw the outpost miles away from the top of the hill he could see his homeharlok longfang harlok stood on the edge of the path and stared out across the field in front of him the longfang warriors had regrouped after the grimward summit incident and had linked up with a number of travelers heading to the onsallas outpost they had been traveling a lot lately the runeseer would want to know about what is going on word had reached them that directly after the longfangs left the wayward inn that a hunting party of pack graytide warriors attacked it they burned it to the ground and killed a number of people harlok unconsciously growled under his breath remembering the two pack goldmane females they were both part of clan grimward and were probably behind the attack scouting it out and waiting to send word as soon as the longfangs left a snarl curled harloks lip a bit as he remembered his duel with the taller female she had a fire in her and some skill with a blade and shield but he hoped some of the cuts he gave her scarred over and reminded her of her place he should have killed her and her mate then and been done with them if he ever met them again he may just have to finish what he started during the duel dria had glowered at him after the honor duel for attempting to finish the goldmane right then and there to turn the duel lethal harlok remembered it well but knew he did not need to explain himself to dria she was but a pup yet and he found her reaction quite cute this wasnt a duel over a mate or some farm land or even a bad insult this was a duel between warriors on two different sides of a war the first civil war in ulven history there is no quarter for clan grimward and their allies after they did such horrible things at the summit he still wasnt sure what azra saw in her or why she tolerated dria but it was not his business to question her as long as she didnt get in his way and fixed their armor he didnt care harlok turned and watched the small group of travelers passing by him they werent ordered to do so but the longfangs had taken up the role of caravan guard and escort for this group of people a mix of humans syndar and ulven walked with their belongings and carts along the path it is a dangerous time the mordok are just as vicious as ever and now grimward warriors prowl the roads and attack the settlers and ulven that have not pledged allegiance to them the world has been turned upside down and it will only get bloodier one of the travelers stumbled and fell dropping some personal belongings and getting dirt on their clean clothing harlok grunted in mock amusement as he pondered how weak and pathetic most of the colonists were half of them are barely worth a damn in a fight and the other half are just useless the culture of the humans and syndar was amusing to harlok how such great civilizations could spring up from such a frail stock of people was beyond his comprehension it amused harlok that half of them had no idea how to fight the mordok some of them just clambered around in their heavy metal armor and expected the mordok to fight them some others expected the mordok to line up on some pretty grass field and fight on equal terms the mordok do not fight such a way they run away from you if you are too strong attack you if you are weak and every fight is bloody and lethal the ulven know especially pack longfang the very armor that protects you from their wicked blades could be the reason why you cant catch them harlok growled in frustration at this train of thought and decided to abandon it some of them will never learn he hoped that raskolf of the watchwolves was right that aiding the colonists was the right answer branthur and kragen from clan nightriver are fully committed to this cause even if it means violence against other clans it didnt matter to harlok he simply followed the orders of his runeseer and she had decreed that the longfangs support the watchwolves until she deems it otherwise he would fulfill his duty to her and his pack if she changed her mind well then he may be on the other side of this war only time will tell harlok reached up to stare at his bandaged left hand he flexed his hand back and forth feeling the new tissue strain against the scabs and the pain that came with it his bandage was still bloody the result of continuing to fight and hold weapons it was not given the proper time to heal and was taking much longer than expected but he would live with it anger flashed behind harloks eyes as he remembered the graytide summit the escalation and the bloody fight that broke out boiled his rage khulgar he was so close to smashing his head into a pulp on the great hall floor wigwald stood up to khulgar to save magrat and yawn and he paid for it with his life harlok knew that khulgar would recover from the wounds and the beating that harlok gave him maybe they would all get lucky and he will catch an infection and die a straw death in his sleep graytides and longfangs have crossed paths in the past and he knew there would be very bad blood between the packs before this war was through the graytides claim to be strong warriors but harlok relishes in the thought of crossing blades with them again harloks thoughts changed to that of bigger and darker things mardrun is engulfed in civil war the dead now walk the sacred lands of gaia he still could not wrap his head around it maybe clan grimward was right maybe things are the way they are because of the colonists in only 10 short years after the colonists arrived the ulven are at war with each other and the dead roam the land it is hard to denounce the coincidence the walking corpses terrified harlok harlok longfang proud son of the heroic hanseth longfang candidate for the legendary tundra wolves slayer of hundreds of mordok ulven vanguard and veteran of the first conflict with the colonists experienced warrior of the strong and elite pack longfang and survivor of the grueling fang trials was scared the stories that the colonists spun had always been alien to him like exaggerated tales of monsters but facing them first hand harlok was ashamed of himself and his reaction to them luckily it was dark so that the others could not see his terrified face luckily raskolf had been there behind him so that when his faltering legs wanted to take steps backwards and away from the lich he was instead forced to press onward he could not understand how the others were so casual about this were these not the monsters that destroyed the entire continent of faedrun the humans they carried on about finding fungus and rocks and earning a couple stupid coins how are they not terrified magrat seemed to know she was the one who knew how to prepare for the fight with the lich harlok was not ashamed to say that he needed her knowledge and resolve that evening she is one of them now a longfang and his fellow warriors would need to rely on her to combat this new enemy even if we are scared pack longfang will not shy away from this or any other fight harloks mind pondered about the new addition to his pack some of her customs and her actions concerned or confused him a bit but this was a very different world now at first he thought she was weak until she accompanied him on a patrol deep into the swamp at the outpost months back and she impressed him she was the first outsider to be accepted into the village he couldnt imagine some of the others like the timid green shirted female or the loud human male in metal armor ever earning a place inside the elite pack longfang the green syndar still had a lot to learn she could fight but was still no match for most of the warriors harlok didnt blame her he knew her people raised her with different skills and beliefs the same way that other packs and clans of ulven will have different backgrounds she may not be prepared for standup heavy skirmish fighting but she was a hunter and a shaman she brought new skills to the longfangs that could support them but she took to the longfangs quickly and respected them and became one of them harlok remembered her strike that left a ragged scar on his neck during her induction trial and he grinned a feral grin she fought like a cornered animal and it pleased him that she could tap into that she earned her place and he would break the jaw of any ulven that didnt respect that he promised that he would step on the shores of faedrun to return her home to her people and he relished the thought of it harlok hefted his spear onto his shoulder and regarded the travelers like he would a convoy of bugs sometimes he couldnt even stomach the weaker packs of his own kind watching the rabble of outsiders was both cynically amusing and painfully irritating if only he could talk he would tell them exactly what he thought of most of them he also decided that the next time someone laughed at him when he tried to gesture he was going to break their jaw it was a different world indeed thought harlok as he stepped back onto the path and in line with the caravan of travelersvenator oathkeeper news of the disastrous peace summit quickly found its way to william of vandregon upon hearing the news from the surviving summit members of pack longfang william left with his new recruits to assist settlements around new hope for the coming storm of war and hopefully to bolster the ranks of his army venator oathkeeper however stayed behind to rest his travels had found him at the wayward inn on the day it was attacked it was there that he had encountered a gravely injured fugitive greytide by the name of rogar with a hostile warband of greytide warriors hot on his trail venator and the other patrons of the wayward inn had offered shelter to rogar and the inn had come under attack by his pursuers the inn was ill prepared for the attack and suffered greatly for it many people were either injured or killed after a second wave of greytides attacked rogar risked his life to let the survivors escape following the harrowing flight into nightriver territory venator approached rogar with a proposition so the graytides have burned down the wayward inn have they yes said rogar i tried to hold them back and give you and the others time to escape but they were hell bent on burning it to the ground  i havent met many greytides in my time said venator but meeting a warrior of your stature confuses me greatly you arent like the rest of them you arent afraid are you calling my people cowards no and i mean no disrespect to you or your family but the fact is that the greytides fear us that is why they hate us so that is why they so blindly follow khulgar you are different you find your own path and you follow your own heart venator locked eyes with rogar and removed his axe from its ring here he said offering the axe to rogar take this the ax was sturdy though it had clearly seen battle rogar took it warily why are you giving me this oathkeeper because rogar i think your heart is in it rogar seemed to be studying the axe intently but in reality he was searching himself for an answer by your actions today continued venator oathkeeper you have proven yourself to be what all ulven should strive to be an honorable warrior every warrior needs a reliable weapon i have carried that axe for years and it has served me well now i give it to you as a token of my appreciation and as thanks from the people youve helped thank you oathkeeper you honor me with this gift where will you go rogar now that you are no longer a greytide rogar looked off into the horizon to the west he would never be allowed to set foot in his homeland again i hadnt really given it much thought yet he whispered come with me to new hope rogar join me and stand with vandregon you have already shown that you are willing to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves why not do it alongside those who share the same ideals of brotherhood and equality you speak as if youve been practicing this speech grumbled rogar i have not but i have been told these same things by a wise man whom i admire believe what you want but i wasnt always like this i used to be selfish greedy vengeful and full of rage i had nothing to fight for i had nothing to believe in because of that i tried to fight the world i looked to only advance my own selfish wants one day i came across a very talented human by the name of william i fought him out of spite and was humbled but instead of making an enemy of me he offered me friendship he offered me a chance to be more than what i was to fight for something bigger than myself ever since that day i have fought beneath that banner my days as a lone wolf are over so you think i should join vandregon if your heart is in it venator said placing a hand upon rogars shoulder i would be honored to have you fight at my side venator sighed i cant promise you all the glory that a lonelier road may earn he continued but i can promise you that if you join william and me we will fight to ensure that the events that have transpired here today will never happen again enough talk friend i will give you some time to think about it wait said rogar what you speak of sounds like the thing this world needs rogar ran his finger along the blade of the axe i will follow you and william well then we dont have time to lose exclaimed the veteran warrior embracing rogar venator suddenly snarled in pain as he recoiled and clutched his injured chest on second thought he grunted lets find a healer first im afraid im in no condition to travel like thisyawn longfang nikolai longfang stanrick longfang raskolf vakr harlok longfang magrat farwalker azra steelfang dria northwind the sunhorse had disappeared over the horizon but residual hues of orange still brushed the caravan camp the colors gently melted away however and gave way to a palette of blues as raskolf drew upon his long stemmed pipe though the glow from the bowl briefly splattered his features with the color of the sunset past it has been far too long raskolf said imglyf leaning onto the shoulder of her childhood friend indeed it has said raskolf i only wish the cause of our reunion were a more joyous occasion aye these are troubling times for sure but let us not dwell on the darkness there will be plenty of time for that once you have been safely delivered to the great hall of the grimwards the pair stretched and rose to their feet the campfires of the caravan could be seen flickering in the east representatives from the settlements had rendezvoused with the ulven of the watchwolves clan nightriver and pack longfang tomorrow they would be meeting with clan grimward their mission was to stop a civil war before it happened imglyf was a sturdy woman nearly as tall as raskolf she had a round face and could go from warm smile to whitehot snarl in less than a second not a lot of people could tell you that though since the ulven dont believe in communicating with the dead she would have been a very beautiful woman if one could only look past the burns she wore the heavy armor and fine furs of a warpack leader her shield bore the distinctive heraldry of the lunar camp of the watchwolves it was the same heraldry that raskolf was born under though his current station not to mention his marriage had seen him settled far away to the eastern horizon in the solar camp that little elise of yours raskolf is this the first time she has met your parents asked imglyf it is i havent made it back to the western camp for years if i had i would have been sure to visit you she seems to be quite spirited are the stories she tells of your adventures true yes i have not raised a liar she has fought the mordok since she was six and was at my side when we faced the lich and his hungry ghosts raskolf replied really and what of these tales of the night horse smirked imglyf she befriended the little prince of new aldoria on one of our diplomatic missions she believes that his horse is the night horse of luna imglyf laughed and leaned on her old friend as they walked it is actually quite understandable said raskolf the horses from faedrun are twice as big as the creatures we are used to here and this particular horse was as black as soot i meant no offense toward your child raskolf she is a delightful child a little thin perhaps but strong for her size and brave for her age lighten up imglyfs eyes met the road for a few seconds you you seem to have done well for yourself raskolf she said i dont know imglyf i dishonored myself past the point of retribution and destroyed the one thing i wanted in life i failed my family i failed the clan i failed my friends i failed the tundra wolves and now theyre gone the only reason i hold my current station is through the grace of my high priestess i wasnt talking about your position raskolf i was talking about your family oh yes i am blessed but i still disagree with the statement that i have done well for myself i have a wonderful daughter and a wife of high station who loves me more than i deserve i didnt do well for myself and i certainly didnt do well for those who needed me i was just very fortunate do you think that the high priestess has put you in such a position out of spite is it a way to torture you no of course not she loves me she loves me and protects me just as i do to her i see said imglyf thats what makes it so hard imglyf i know i dont deserve what i have and what do you deserve raskolf asked imglyf raskolf opened his mouth to say something but stopped himself before any words crossed his lips imglyfs icy blue eyes sent a chill down raskolfs spine and into the pit of his stomach the two stopped walking and stared at each other raskolf clenched his teeth broke eye contact and started walking again he stared submissively at the path it was silent for a few long minutes save the crunch of the gravel beneath their feet youve changed raskolf youve changed and it is a shame you obviously dont remember what you told me when we were young the pair stopped in front of one of the caravan tents raskolf didnt say anything love is blind said imglyf removing her helmet and letting the cool night air dance with the patchy wisp that remained of her scalp you told me that love is blind ive lived off of those words for twenty years obviously they never really meant anything to you are you really that selfish you talk all the time of this lesson you have learned in humility but when it comes down to it it is all about you dont you see it isnt about what you deserve there is no such thing look at my face raskolf life doesnt care what anyone deserves but people care imglyf people cared about what happened to you people cared about what happened to me people want justice those people can burn i killed the one who did this to me but it didnt fix anything it didnt make me feel better justice isnt real it was still a matter of honor imglyf for the clan then the devourer can have the clan you are getting awfully irreverent old friend you want irreverence raskolf i have not yet begun to defile my honor imglyf put her helmet upon her hand as though it were a puppet moving the visor up and down with her fingers as she spoke look at me said the helmet in a mocking singsong voice my name is raskolf vakr im a whiny little bitchpup the clans are at the brink of war and i have been sent to keep the peace never mind the fact that my actions might change the world you live in you should feel sorry for me for having to represent you thats not what i sound like growled raskolf who said that replied the helmet i cant see anyone speaking of blindness im so goddessdamned blind that i cant see anything my woman sees in me that is really immature imglyf its a good thing we never married that is really immature repeated the helmet raskolf and imglyf were suddenly bathed in lamplight as the front flap of the tent opened and revealed the confused face of father aegeus the human representative from crows landing enough shouted raskolf suddenly embarrassed to be pointing a finger into the empty face of a helmet the human clerics eyes were wide and he slowly backed into his tent and began fastening the ties raskolf said imglyf your wife is the high priestess of the watchwolf clan she saw all of this before it happened she saw war she saw the monsters did it ever occur to you to ask her what she sees in you or had you really convinced yourself that she was the one who was blind i i never thought damnit raskolf you told me that love was blind after i was scarred you told me that not only was love blind but that love was blind because raven had pecked out her eyes you said that love had been maimed but that didnt change who she was and that through her suffering the most unlikely of us could find each other that was how i knew i had someone special in you the other boys stopped courting me after this happened to me but you still pursued me raskolf was quiet for a moment but then why he asked why did you reject me i courted you for gaias sake tears rolled down the one eye that imglyf had which still watered properly i rejected you the night before the tundra wolf selection she said because i wanted you to go i wanted you to pursue your dream i didnt want to be a burden i didnt want to be your regret i didnt want to be your mistake ten years down the line i hurt you because i wanted to make you angry i wanted to make you strong and give you an advantage over the other boys it worked but if i had said yes to you you never would have tried out you would have just settled for me an ugly mate youd probably be a turnip farmer or something i cant believe this all this time wait a minute you dared to complain about me and call me whiny we could have been mated twenty years now but you somehow felt that you werent worthy or deserving what hypocrisy is this you miss the point raskolf she sighed things happen for a reason my action set into motion the events which shaped the man you are you are not the man i need you are the man the ulven need your wife sees it and so do i it is comforting that you have faith in me but still i doubt myself would it have been more comforting if i hadnt just openly admitted what a fool i am possibly said raskolf it is always easier to have faith in another than in yourself imglyf shuddered some lessons muttered raskolf can only be learned the hard way i for example have learned never to question the wisdom of a woman even if she is a hopeless fool raskolf yes said raskolf especially so for the first time in twenty years the two embraced under the light of the moon you know raskolf whispered imglyf i think i may have been wrong about one thing maybe you are the man i need raskolf kissed imglyf on the head and then he pushed her away i would not question the wisdom of a woman he said but her desires are another thing entirely good night friend i will see you in the morning we have a long day ahead of us raskolf watched imglyf disappear into the night she did not look back at him raskolf began loading his pipe with tobacco as he walked towards the campfire he took a seat on the ground next to some slumbering guards and quietly searched his tobacco pouch for a small lightingstick finding a suitable one he gently placed it upon a rock and watched the tip closest to the flame begin to smolder footsteps approached him from behind he could tell it was a human by the noise they made when they walked raskolf scooted over a bit to make room for father aegeus and the old man unfolded his camp stool to sit down the human cleric didnt say anything he just quietly and carefully loaded his own pipe with shaky but patient hands once the old mans pipe was loaded raskolf removed the smoldering stick from the fire and politely lit the clerics pipe first then his own  at the next campfire over the longfangs were stretching out for the night they still wore their armor though they were in reserve right now the watchwolves of luna had taken the night watch appropriately enough but the longfangs had to be ready to fight at a moments notice if the watchwolves sounded the alarm dria and azra had dozed off back to back leaning up against each other yawn was slumped against a log his pipe had gone out and he was drooling on his armor the others were still awake what do you suppose that was all about wigwald asked stanrick as imglyf stormed through their camp without saying a word it looked like she was crying added nikolai how could you tell in the darkness nikolai asked wigwald shes wearing a helmet nikolai has keen eyes pup grunted stanrick there is more to reading a person then just their eyes young wigwald said nikolai there was grief in the way she carried her head and regret in her back aye agreed stanrick i saw embarrassment in her steps as she walked the young longfang looked confused wolves cannot speak as we do can they wigwald stanrick said poking the fire with a branch and illuminating his face with an orange glow as the flames crawled out from the coals and yet said nikolai they speak to each other you must learn to read a persons entire body wigwald not just their face yawn stretched his back snored and passed gas in his sleep he would have been proud of it had he been awake wigwald scooted down a little azra and dria scrunched up their faces in their sleep did you ever wonder pup said nikolai how yawn is so good at communicating with harlok it is because yawn can read him better than any of the rest of us he has a knack for it having known harlok for so long helps i am sure isnt that right stanrick there was no answer i said isnt that right stanrick stanrick was staring up at the moon his eyes were glazed over and he was breathing through his mouth here pup said nikolai have a go at this look at stanrick there what is he thinking about well said wigwald crawling over to get a better look he looks like he is in a trance his eyes are distant and there is a certain sadness to his face look at his shoulders though said nikolai his shoulders are back his back is straight he looks proud very good wigwald but what is he thinking about he is thinking about that human woman again what asked wigwald how can you tell you saw the signs you just have to know how to read them you will learn with time you will learn a lot of things if you dont stop undressing me with your eyes pup you will learn much about hand to hand combat very shortly growled stanrick wigwald quickly averted his eyes and stared submissively into the dirt you may get a lesson in combat sooner than you think anyway whispered magrat tomorrow we will see how the other clans react to your adoption of me harlock grunted suddenly and crawled into the firelight he smoothed out a patch of white ash on the dirt and began drawing with a stick the others gathered around harlok began by drawing many little circles many moons guessed stanrick the past harlock nodded he drew the shape of a big man in armor on the figures chest he made the mark of the graytide pack graytide muttered wigwald harlock grunted and nodded he then pointed to himself drew his short sword and chopped down into the ash when the dust settled the others could see that he had buried the blade perfectly into the figures arm harlok erased the figures arm and then redrew it upon the ground at the figures feet oh said wigwald you have history with them  raskolf and aegeus smoked their pipes in silence when raskolf had finished his he knocked the excess out upon the heel of his boot father aegeus scraped his out with a metal tool i find myself puzzled by your race ambassador said the old man on the one hand i hear all sorts of tales of how savage you are my friars tell of heathens polygamous unions and a bloodthirsty warrior caste they have compared you to wild animals father aegeus fumbled with his tobacco pouch a bit but managed to put his things away without dropping any of them then he continued on the other hand i have seen tonight that you are a philosophical and passionate people you live by a code of honor not only that but you demonstrated that you are capable of withstanding temptation a wild animal could do no such thing clearly my friars are mistaken clearly grunted raskolf you know ambassador said the old cleric little things like this give me hope hope isnt the same thing as confidence father said raskolf we all have hopes hopes are just wishes that have been elegantly disguised well ambassador i place my hope into prayer and that gives me confidence if that is true father then the future of mardrun is merely a wish and a prayer there is a great deal more to it than that i assure you the gods offer us guidance they speak to us in our hearts ambassador listen to your gods and i will listen to mine peace is but the noblest pursuit of important men and peasants alike as long as we are on the side of peace our faith will protect us we will triumph because our cause is righteous and it will be a shared triumph for all peoples of mardrun im relieved to hear that father aegeus as soon as clan grimward has been pacified you will have to show me how your positive attitudes are going to protect us from the hungry ghosts goodnight father aegeus raskolf rasped the old cleric regarding those ghosts let me handle that i am an expert on the subject of the undead if you can lead the conversation regarding the graytides treaty violations i will handle the part about the undead fair enough said raskolf i know that this might seem like it has come at the worst time but believe me there are forces at work that neither of us can begin to understand the undead should certainly not be welcomed to these shores and yet in the light of the recent tragedy and turmoil involving the graytides the rise of the undead may prove to be a blessing in disguise it may be the key to unity on mardrun when faced with news of the lich clan grimward will almost certainly have to rethink who their friends are this could be the beginning of a grand alliance and a unified crusade against a common foe yes father the prince of new aldoria told me all about your grand alliance on faedrun forgive my rudeness father you said that you have faith in your gods well i have faith in mine my high priestess has foreseen all of this for the last year i have been trying to stop her visions from coming to pass thus far i have failed as far as i know this is our last chance father aegeus shot raskolf a stern look he said nothing im sorry if i have shattered any notions you had of me father aegeus but if it makes you feel any better i am going to bed now and i am still going to bed alone  as the caravan took to the road the next morning it was the first time that the ulven made more noise than the humans father aegeus had convinced all of the colonial delegates not to wear any armor the old cleric himself carried no weapons either but had not been able to convince all of the others to go so far even though he had made a sound argument that the ulven could not attack unarmed men other diplomats remembering the reports of the graytide massacre marched with guards at their sides and carried bright ceremonial blades beneath the traveling cloaks that protected their feasting finery from the dust of the road raskolf wore his armor and carried the same pitted and corroded blade at his side that he did on any other day the other ulven were armed and armored as well the longfangs led the way providing scouts and front security for the caravan while imglyfs watchwolf war pack protected the flanks imglyf herself walked with raskolf but there was a sad and awkward silence between the two today the human dignitaries from the different settlements all had their own bodyguards of course and the men chatted and caroused merrily some even sang songs their attitudes soon changed as the caravan got deeper into grimward territory the road became rougher the woods became more dense and the trees blacker before long a twisted and thorny canopy provided a ceiling to the ever narrowing trail as the trees grew together overhead the scouts became aware of movement in the woods on either side of the caravan large grey wolves paced the travelers and bright green eyes flickered in the shadow occasionally the silhouette of a man would be seen but only briefly before it melted back into the darkness of the blighted wood eventually the caravan began to enter the clearings of the village outskirts as the humble farms and homes came into view raskolf noted that the buildings were adorned with strange totems of bone they were not the bones of animals raskolfs mind raced the rumors were true the graytides really had violated the tenets of gaia they were taking trophies from the dead imglyf had seen it too she turned to raskolf with a worried look upon her face before he could say anything the caravan was being surrounded warriors of graytide seemed to melt out of the forest on all sides from the ring of warriors a spokeswoman emerged my name is wargah she said who goes there wargah was tall and lean she was dressed in black furs and dull heavy chain mail at her side she held a gleaming white sword that contrasted sharply with her drab clothes and armor the only traces of color upon her were her bright green eyes and her bloodred hair her shield bore the mark of clan grimward good morning wargah i am father aegeus cornelius barringer said the old cleric pushing past the guards and fearlessly stepping up to wargah he meant to look her in the eye but she was much taller than he had realized and he found himself looking squarely into her chest now taking a step back he maintained his composure as i was saying he said looking up into her face and offering his hand i am father aegeus and these are members of the resolution delegation enclave of mardrun we have come to speak to clanleader haygreth grimward wargah ignored the shaky hand of the old cleric and turned her back to him he is expecting you she growled you are the last group to arrive follow me the great hall of the grimwards was a huge longhouse of black wood both the architecture and the furniture had a rough shod appearance to it as though it wasnt really finished and were held together in part by splinters the ulven delegates sauntered in as a group along with their escorts the human delegates from new aldoria and crows landing entered next and were accompanied by standard bearers the clan nightiver representatives were last along with some human diplomats from newhope colony at the head of the largest banquet table stood the massive haygreth grimward the clan leader flanked closely by pack graytide chieftain khulgar graytide and representatives from all of the grimward packs except the blackwings a few independent packs were present as well as several representatives from other clans to the north a representative from clan stormjarl south of grimward was also present the way the grimwards and their allies had clustered together at one end of the longhouse opposite the newcomers made it look almost as if the two groups were already lining up for battle as raskolf took his position on the floor between the two groups he couldnt help but feel as though he stood between two rival armies he also couldnt help but notice that one of khulgars bodyguards had the bones of a human pelvis bolted to his helmet like ornamental horns brothers and sisters said raskolf i would today like to address you all as such be you my fellow children of the great black wolf or be you honored guests in our lands thank you for enough with your humiliating flattery shouted khulgar this is my clanleaders house it disturbs me to see someone i have fought alongside in the past kissing this much ass continue with your report but get to the point very well i am pleased to report that although poorly received initially the security resolution has been widely accepted by the colonists the colonists are for the most part complying with the terms and conditions if we are here to talk about our colonist problem growled khulgar then why raskolf did you bring them with you khulgar i have brought these men with me because there is another urgent issue which needs to be addressed and we will get to that shortly lets get to it right now raskolf growled haygreth i dont like to be kept waiting it makes it feel as though someone is keeping something from me or perhaps that you are trying to sell something clanleader haygreth please forgive me but with all due respect we must address these matters in order i am not ready to surrender the floor yet surrender the floor barked khulgar you mean to tell me that you have brought this brightly colored rabble into our hall with the intent of letting them talk who gave you the right to do such a thing would you make a mockery out of my clanleaders longhouse matters pertaining to the management of the invaders are strictly the business of the clanleaders of grimward and nightriver i beg your pardon khulgar started raskolf enough shouted khulgar enough of this farce have you spent so much time with these wretched refugees that you have adopted their ways it was bad enough you wanted to solve the problem with paper and written words now you want to bring their disgusting customs into my clans home this is more than embarrassing it is an outrage the bodyguard with the pelvis helmet began obnoxiously laughing and pointing a finger at raskolf the room broke into a cacophony of shouting from both sides you want to do this that way khulgar snarled raskolf fine we will do it your way raskolf strode up to the table leapt on top of it and kicked a pitcher of mead into the lap of the pelvis helmeted guard causing uproarious laughter from both sides my name is raskolf vakr and i am the voice of the watchwolves i will be heard i traveled west because my high priestess anjan ravensmark has seen portents indicating that disaster looms on the very horizons that my people watch as is our sacred duty to gaia silence fell over the room i came here to prevent that disaster the eyes and ears of the watchwolves identified threats to the ulven way of life as well as those of the colonists the resolution we drafted addressed those threats if only people would listen the people did listen they have begun to comply with our conditions we now have peace with new aldoria the dangerous idol is safely in the hands of ulven witches almost all of the newcomers villages have agreed to do not lecture me about portents cackled a womans voice i have seen with my own eyes what the future holds for my people a tiny woman buried in a bundle of rags suddenly emerged from the ranks of the grimwards she bore the staff of a high priestess and hunched as he walked the warriors parted to let her through did you think that we needed guidance from your blind witch the woman sneered raskolf recognized her she was a blackwing the last time hed met her was over five years ago when anjan had traveled to a ceremony in grimward territory raskolf gritted his teeth your priestess may have smelled the portents on the west wind but i have actually seen them with my eyes it has been prophesied that these outsiders will bring about the death of gaia ancient song tells us that no mordok can ever kill the great wolf but that the great wolf will meet his doom on the day when the sun no longer rises a strange god will kill the great wolf and then will kill gaia after the very last of her children have been slain there was a sudden eruption of activity in the longhouse as everyone on either side tried to talk at once your papers are a joke raskolf vakr and we do not welcome the guidance of your crippled priestess with her head injuryinduced visions thats rich muttered azra to dria a blackwing calling someone else crazy raskolf kicked a turkey platter and all halfway across the room and took a few steps toward the blackwing high priestess before any of the grimwards could go for their steel the priestess clapped her hands together and sent raskolf flying backwards off of the table and onto the floor with an invisible battering ram of arcane energy the longfangs and watchwolves immediately leapt to their feet but raskolf motioned for them to stay back this is no time for infighting shouted raskolf we stand at the brink of war indeed we do growled khulgar by your resolution i thought i knew what side you were on but now i have my doubts the resolution stated our demands of the colonists and clearly communicated to them in their own language the rules they were to follow if they were to be allowed to live in our lands raskolf said they have agreed to follow those rules you talk of taking sides but my resolution has avoided war isnt that the best we could have hoped for your paper didnt fix anything snarled haygreth the outsiders have not halted their expansion im sure that by now you have heard the humans side of what happened north of the border i was waiting to hear your side before i discussed it said raskolf we all were shouted the delegate from new aldoria very well you should be proud of us raskolf we actually played your game we approached the trespassers and told them that they were in violation of the nightriver treaties we informed them that under the authority of your watchwolf resolution we had every right to cull them they refused to leave and instead took up arms against us we had every right to do what we did since when do the graytides have the right to violate the tenets of gaia by desecrating bodies and taking trophies shouted stanrick this question was punctuated by angry shouts from both sides you dare question me in the face of gaia bellowed khulgar you who have brought an outsider whore into your own pack and allowed her to wear ulven runes i was mistaken for i had thought pack longfang were proud and noble warriors of gaia i thought that onsallas was a strong outpost on the fringe of ulven lands and not a homeless shelter for strays the longfangs snarled at this and harlok flipped a chair into the center of the room magrat is more ulven than the filth i see seated across from me barked stanrick look at you covered in your blasphemous trophies you dont look like ulven to me at all you look like mordok chaos erupted in the longhouse tables were flipped and oaths of vengeance flew back and forth as the rival factions argued with each other raskolf stood in the middle dodging food and mugs imglyf and a few of her warriors moved out to protect the ambassador with a shield wall seeing this display of force the graytides began to encroach on them  steel yourself wigwald shouted stanrick as he noticed the young warriors hesitation and confusion the longfangs moved to assist the watchwolves the novice warrior hesitated a moment before following his brethren he had a terrified look upon his face and his shield shook a little in his grip the graytides measured up the watchwolves and the longfangs for a moment they held back after being met with a line of fangs and snarls weapons were still sheathed on both sides but anxious fingers played on numerous hilts and handles if the situation escalated clan grimward far outnumbered the combined group of the delegates watchwolves and longfangs raskolf shouted imglyf we need to back off for your safety no raskolf snarled we cant back down i must be heard suddenly all the barks snarls screams and curses were drowned out by a single word repeated over and over again in a panicked tone undead the messenger shrieked undead in mardrun the great hall fell silent and the masses parted to let the messenger through clanleader haygreth panted the messenger collapsing to the floor at the clanleaders feet the dead walk on mardrun it has been confirmed the longfangs have traded steel with them the watchwolf ambassador was there too what bellowed haygreth raskolf is this true you dare keep this secret from us no clanleader i have not we were trying to get to that it is the main reason for our visit liar shouted khulgar no said father aegeus stepping out onto the floor and motioning for the watchwolves and longfangs to make a path i am father aegeus cornelius barringer most honorable host of mine i dedicated my life to fighting the undead on faedrun and it is my specialty the ambassador and i decided that the subject of the undead would be addressed by me given my expertise khulgar eyed the unarmed and unarmored human elder thoughtfully and motioned for his men to back off the old cleric motioned for the watchwolves and longfangs to back up snarls and fangs retracted as they reluctantly backed up and gave him room clanleader haygreth grimward said aegeus it is true the undead do indeed walk on mardrun on faedrun we met our doom because the peoples of that land could not put aside their differences in the beginning instead of banding together to fight the undead we squabbled we pointed fingers we blamed each other it cost us valuable time never again i say never again will the living stand divided while the dead hungrily claw their way across the land today noble haygreth we come to you as allies we come to fight alongside you not against you haygreth was about to say something when he was suddenly interrupted by the blackwing high priestess do not fall into his trap haygreth the invaders have brought their doom with them they have not only brought the winged spirit of death to our lands but now they have brought it to your very house it is they that the rising dead want not us this doom belongs to them and their wretched dying gods no shouted raskolf that is not what the portents say that is not what they say at all silence whelp screeched the old witch your political aspirations have already been made clear traitor you are nothing but a lap dog this is madness growled raskolf he tried to advance on the witch but imglyf and yawn held him tightly by both arms you would dare speak ill of my clan high priestess in my own hall bellowed haygreth it is all a plot haygreth snarled the witch if you fall in league with this filth then you will damn us all to share their doom it will be the end of our people and the death of our gods the decision belongs to the clanleader high priestess said aegeus stepping up to confront her only he can decide what is in the best interest of his people what he needs right now are facts and the fact is that neither the north or south end of this hall can afford to go to war we are already at war with the dead aegeus strode within a few steps of haygreth and extended his hand clanleader haygreth grimward will you accept our friendship haygreth looked to his high priestess he looked to his people he looked at the hand of the old man in front of him wigwald held his breath he had been watching body language more closely since the conversation last night he noticed that for the first time since he had met him the old clerics hands were not shaking haygreth stood before the cleric sizing him up his brow furrowed as he thought then cleared as if he had come to a decision he spoke old man you are right about one thing with lightning speed haygreths hand reached the handle of the massive claymore strapped to his back and cleared it from its sheath raising the blade high above his head he brought it down with such speed and velocity that it cleaved the unarmed cleric from collar bone to navel and caused the lifeless body to bounce three times upon the floor as gore splattered the assemblage we are at war pulling his blade free of father aegeus he addressed the stunned onlookers i haygreth grimward clanleader of clan grimward will stand idly by no longer the outsiders bring the plague of undeath to our lands they poison the lands of gaia and they must be eliminated or cast back into the sea i call upon you warriors and children of gaia to join me to join clan grimward to rid our sacred lands of this filth once and for all we shall bring steel and spill the blood of those that bring death and foreign ways to our lands our homes our families and our traditions join me and may his ears ring with your name boomed the massive clanleader as he raised the blood covered claymore and spread his arms in a commanding posture a chorus of shouts and oaths erupted from the grimward side of the longhouse from the folds of her rags the old crone grinned this is in direct violation of the treaty haygreth and the honor duel shouted the representative from clan nightriver treaties belong to the invaders not us growled khulgar the honor duel was fake roared haygreth it was a lie from now on we will do things my way khulgar remove the heads of this delegation and send them home in bags that will be my message the air rang out with the foreboding symphony of steel being drawn the entire great hall glinted with flashes of silver as warriors from both sides unsheathed their weapons the line had been drawn the ulven had chosen their sides ulven would spill ulven blood the noise was replaced by the growing thunder of numerous clan grimward warriors charging into battle there was a rush of activity as shields cracked together and steel rained down upon steel the human guards of the now slain father aegeus were ground down beneath the swords and axes of the assault their dying cries adding to the chaos of the great hall it was quick brutal and obvious the grimward warriors would take no prisoners get the delegates out of here raskolf shouted to imglyf and her watchwolves linking up with the surviving delegation bodyguards the watchwolves formed a shield wall around the remaining human diplomats raskolf had yet to draw his sword and stood atop a bench shouting orders for the longfangs to move up and cover the retreat of the delegation idiot shouted imgryf grabbing him by the arm and pulling him down off of his perch as an arrow shrieked through the spot where his face had been a second ago you are part of the delegation raskolf tried to protest but imglyf wrapped her cloak and shield around him and dragged him towards the door dont worry raskolf shouted stanrick well be right behind you the longfangs had managed to overturn three of the massive banquet tables for cover and to delay the attackers despite the obstacle the warriors of pack graytide advanced pressing quickly to pursue the delegation the longfangs were outnumbered and would be overwhelmed once the remaining clan grimward warriors finished off the human guards and joined the fight raskolf needed them to protect the delegation to get out of the town and the longfangs were prepared to do whatever was necessary out of my way bitc growled a graytide warrior his words were cut short as a sweeping arc of azras sword caught him in the throat and ripped it open she crouched into a low fighting stance baring her fangs with a growl at the oncoming graytides dria roared and swung her double bladed axe catching another graytide in the shield it splintered and shattered as the warrior holding it was knocked to the ground by the strength of her fury a flash of metal darted out as harloks spear tip buried itself into the chest of another graytide the warrior cringed and clutched for the wound the spear pulled free dripping scarlet and returned a second then a third time lodging itself deep into the gut of the same graytide harlok roared a feral cry and bared his saber fangs as he shouldered his entire strength into the spear the tip punched through the back of the graytide in a spray of blood as the body slumped to the floor nikolai squared off against a graytide warrior and they exchanged several blows most were turned aside by shields but a solid sword blow caught nikolai in his pauldron although the swords edge was not able to penetrate his armor the impact was forceful enough to knock nikolai backwards reeling in pain the stumbling ulven let out a roar as he planted his feet and bashed his opponents shield aside exposing the shoulder enough to drive his battle axe deep into the flesh of the graytide blood spattered and bone crunched as the graytide warrior cried out and fell back from the terrible wound using his spear harlok was trying desperately to keep an immense graytide warrior at bay the warriors great axe swung in a furious arc and buried itself deep into the table with such force that it split the solid timber in two sending harlok sprawling azra and dria one on each side grabbed the arms of the unbalanced graytide and pulled him clean through of the break in the table where he crashed facefirst into harloks lap before either could react stanrick let out a fearsome howl and buried the pointed end of his sword through the base of the prone warriors skull and into the floor just inches away from harloks crotch the fallen warriors legs kicked spectacularly for a moment as his nervous system shut down one of his boots catching dria in the mouth harloks eyes were wide but he regained his composure and scrambled toward his spear stanrick growled as he shieldbashed an advancing graytide warrior knocking him off balance in one swift motion he pulled his sword free of the skull of the fallen graytide and drove it into the gut of the second warrior a wellplaced and powerful blow with the edge of his shield to the graytides temple finished him with a sickening crunch magrat managed to loose two arrows into the mob of graytides before they began leaping over the tables to close with her glancing over her shoulder she saw the watchwolf shield wall was funneling out the main entrance with the delegation she was about to shout to stanrick to fall back to the watchwolves but a powerful hand clamped onto her throat crushing her windpipe and completely cutting off her airway she instinctively reached for her dagger but another powerful arm punched her hard in the stomach and then grasped onto her free arm hey khulgar laughed one of her captors what color does a greenskin turn when you choke them i want her alive snapped khulgar from across the table she isnt worthy to die in combat fighting alongside such respected foes she will provide us with entertainment tonight before the graytide warrior could reply every bone in his wrist and most of the ones in his hand had been shattered by a powerful swing from yawns heavy mace as the graytide cried out in pain yawn roared and continued his assault raining down numerous blows with his mace the graytides helmet eventually caved in blood and gore oozed out from underneath it as his head was pulverized magrat hissed and with her free hand managed to get a grip on her dagger and slashed the other graytide across both eyes sending him spinning and wailing to the floor in a spray of blood and vitreous fluids imbeciles snarled khulgar as he strode resolutely through the break in the tables kicking them further apart with such fury that he knocked stanrick over yawn raised his mace to meet the graytide chieftan but before he could close with him khulgar casually raised and launched a javelin with the same nonchalance that one flicks a toothpick the javelin flew swiftly through the air like a falcon on the dive and buried itself deep in yawns shoulder instantly paralyzing his arm and causing his mace to fall khulgar walked up and punched yawn solid in the face then picked up the fallen mace never breaking stride he swung it at magrat having only a dagger at the moment magrat side stepped and brought her weapon up to parry what she thought was an attack to her chest her error became clear as khulgar followed through with the swing at his intended target and simultaneously planted the mace square on magrats foot pinning it to the floor with several of its spikes magrats cry of pain was cut off by a quick backhand across her face with his gauntleted fist the force of the blow knocked her backwards until her body weight pulled against the metal spikes in her foot sending fresh gouts of blood oozing out of the wound in her foot as her flesh tore against the anchor khulgar snarled at the green syndar and unhooked his battleaxe from his belt he raised it to finish her but suddenly found himself blocked by the skinny form of a longfang novice the young man wore illfitting armor that he had barely grown into and held his shield at the weak angle of an amateur khulgar easily smashed the shield aside breaking wigwalds arm in the process and sending him spinning down to one knee khulgar waited a second to see if the boy would get up dazed by the pain and with one arm dangling uselessly wigwald gritted his teeth and staggered to his feet to once again face the grizzled veteran from across the room nikolai helplessly watched wigwald in horror as he traded blows with a graytide warrior with fang and fury wigwald he shouted hoping to help steel the young warriors resolve are you finished khulgar growled in warning to the young man wigwald looked back at the struggling forms of yawn and magrat rage flickered in his eyes with a scream that cracked his voice wigwald bared his fangs raised his sword and charged the graytide chieftan khulgar tried to sidestep the clumsy attack but the sword still caught flesh and khulgar took a small yet penetrating slash across the shoulder ignoring the young mans exposed neck the graytide instead elected to go for his abdomen after several quick and repeated blows khulgars attacks defeated the armor and hacked into flesh poor wigwalds entrails spilled upon the floor impertinent whelp growled khulgar as he intentionally left wigwald to die a slow and horrific death wigwald panicked and scrambled upon the blood slick floor he tried to pick up his insides for a few seconds before he went into shock and fell gasping into the fetal position khulgar once again started towards yawn and magrat but before he could take another step he heard the enraged roar of harlok longfang and braced for impact harlok charged striking him hard enough to rattle teeth and pushing him completely off course away from yawn and magrat within a matter of seconds the two were raining axe blows furiously down upon each other magrat still hadnt managed to free her foot but more graytides were closing in fast and clan grimward warriors were starting to join the fight grabbing her bow and firing as best she could with such awkward footing she began sinking pointblank arrows into the masses as fast as she could just as she fired off her last arrow yawn managed to free his mace from her foot and the floor the two stood surrounded and back to back yawn was holding his mace in his off hand and magrat was down to a dagger across the room stanrick azra and dria were desperately trying to get to nikolai who had been isolated and backed into a corner nikolai had moved out a bit to put himself in between several attacking graytide warriors who were flanking harlok a sword lashed out and opened up nikolais thigh a javelin shattered upon nikolais shield driving long sharp splinters into his eye and causing blood to flow freely down his neck and arm the warrior staggered and stumbled back from the blow swinging blindly against the pain and the wethot wound in his one eye and trying to blink past the uncontrollable tears in the other  outside the watchwolves and nightrivers had moved the delegation through the town and they were making progress toward the trail it was a grindingly slow process however as it seemed that every man woman and child had taken up arms even unarmored farmers hindered the progress of the shield wall with pitchforks and murderous archery rained down upon the formation from every building the formation was becoming smaller as it went and the dead and wounded fell out despite the efforts of the human bodyguards the handful of clan nightriver representatives and the watchwolves the new aldorian diplomat had already fallen killed instantly by an arrow to the face the nobleman was simply too fat to carry and his body had been discarded on the road where graytide children stabbed it with sticks and spears the delegate from newhope had lost both his page and his standard bearer the formation was leaving quite the trail of fallen warriors in its wake as well just as they finally cleared the outskirts of town and made it to the road a barricade of carts and fresh troops blocked their path the delegate from newhope broke ranks and tried to run but was cut down by a burly graytide woman wielding a scythe his bodyguard didnt go after him at the front of the enemy formation stood wargah with her white blade in hand raskolf broke ranks to confront her you look surprised raskolf vakr she sneered if i didnt know better id say this was the first time youd ever led troops into an ambush raskolf drew his sword its dull and pitted surface seemed the perfect antithesis to wargahs white blade wargah grimward he shouted daughter of haygreth grimward i challenge you to an no roared imglyf shield bashing raskolf into the mud from behind this bitch is mine as imglyf closed on wargah the grimward warrior barked at her men to back off honor duel she snarled as the two women closed in on each other  inside the longhouse khulgar graytide and harlok longfang had both lost their axes to the sturdy furniture of the great hall the two now rolled and thrashed on the floor biting punching and stabbing each other with their sacramax daggers the floor was slick with the blood of many warriors and khulgar was now wearing part of poor wigwalds insides on the back of his pauldron rolling harlok onto his back khulgar changed the grip on his dagger and plunged it straight down at harloks neck but the longfang suddenly thrust his empty hand into the path of the dagger the blade bit deep into the flesh of harloks hand all the way down until the hilt stopped on his palm gritting his teeth harlok howled in pain as he twisted his hand around the blade trapping it in his own hand and then ripped the dagger out of khulgars hand the two broke free of each other and khulgar scrambled to find a weapon lunging for wigwalds sword the graytide chieftans hand was stopped just a fingertip away and nailed to the floor by the dagger harlok held in his good hand harlok proceeded to madly stomp and kick khulgars chest and head until he was ready to drop from exhaustion khulgars head would have been crushed if not for his sturdy metal helm but a continued assault would eventually kill him harloks savage attack was cut short by an arrow to the collarbone that staggered him and caused him to take a knee and fall back to the other longfangs azra and dria were wearing out they had held their own until now but exhaustion was setting in and they were losing ground to the fresh warriors who now assaulted them each had innumerable cuts and gashes in their armor and flesh azra had been forced to discard her shield in order to staunch a deep bleeding gouge in her side as dria continued to bring her massive axe down on her opponents despite an arrow sticking clear through her calf yawn and magrat were nearly surrounded in the center of the hall they had both been struck with several arrows the evidence of which stuck out from their bodies like porcupine quills magrat gritted her teeth in pain as she pulled an arrow out of her thigh and used it to fire back into the throat of one of the attackers dizziness washed over her as her blood flowed her vision beginning to fail her as she fought she muttered a prayer of her people a death chant as she prepared to sell her life dearly in the cost of blood yawn was deliriously throwing plates cups and tableware at his attackers and slurring curses the grimwards found this quite entertaining and had actually stopped shooting at magrat and yawn just so they could watch and laugh nikolais eye bled terribly but he continued to hack at the attacking graytides stanrick was trying to protect nikolai but his strength was failing and he was bleeding almost as badly as his friend he couldnt move his left leg at all anymore and was dangerously off balance the longfangs had slowed the graytides and clan grimward warriors from getting out of the main door of the great hall but they were losing the fight and found themselves backed into the southern wall of the longhouse  haygreth grimward had been summoned to witness his daughters honor duel against the watchwolf warpack leader with the burned face in terms of height and reach the women were evenly matched the watchwolf was stronger however and definitely much more powerful she was slower than haygreths daughter though and likely twice her age with every swing the watchwolf threatened to either decapitate or dismember wargah grimward wargah however was no easy target the young grimward dodged rolled and parried with the reflexes and speed of a cat the magic of her blade augmenting her already superb dexterity haygreth watched his daughter with proud approval but then he noticed something it was an old trick difficult to spot even for an old veteran like him the watchwolf was feigning exhaustion her movements were exaggerated and slow yet her arms were still steady and she was not breathing hard her eyes gave it away there was cold steel in those eyes and a calm confidence as haygreth watched his heart skipped a beat he knew what was about to happen and he knew his daughter would fall for it especially in her excitement of having him witness to her duel imglyf led her adversary on leading her to believe that she was tiring it was working she could see it in the flashing green of the young warriors eyes wargah was excited and impatient she could taste victory at precisely the perfect moment imglyf overswung a ridiculously exaggerated blow and pretended her weapon was trapped in the earth wargah leapt recklessly in for the kill as she was still flying through the air her father felt his heart sink he gritted his teeth and watched in horror as the watchwolf spryly rolled to the opposite side and swung her weapon about into a reverse grip wargah realized her mistake too late both her feet were already in the air all she could do was utter a silent prayer to the great wolf as she hurtled straight at the business end of imglyfs blade as wargah grimtide landed upon the blade the watchwolf was as solid as a stone there was no give for a moment both were still and looked as if statues in a tender embrace the equanimity was shattered when wargah vomited blood over imglyfs shoulder imglyf pulled her weapon free of haygreths daughter and stood to face the rest of the assembled warriors as wargah lay dying on the bloodied earth clawing convulsing and rasping for help she looked to see her father turn his back on her to rejoin his guards no she gurgled through her sobs and tears i have not failed you dont leave me dont leave me father as imglyf turned and walked towards the rest of the watchwolves raskolf suddenly shouted and started running towards her pointing to something behind her time seemed to slow down imglyf turned just in time to see a flash of black arcane energy erupting from the hands of the defeated grimward before she could react the deathbolt had burned a hole the size of a helmet through imglyfs torso the proud watchwolf warpack leader staggered in her step but kept her footing somehow turning once again to face her troops she marched resolutely back to the formation and took her place in the ranks before collapsing raskolf helped lower her to the ground in the songs raskolf she choked in the songs have the bards make me beautiful the great wolf howls your name i can hear him youre right smiled imglyf i hear him too when imglyf died there were tears in both her eyes even the one that never watered properly go get my daughters body growled haygreth before his warriors could comply raskolf and the watchwolves had closed in on wargah grimward she still lives haygreth snarled raskolf but you have no right to her her treachery has violated the sanctity of the honor duel by all rights she is mine to execute raskolf pressed the stained and pitted blade of his sword against the unconscious girls throat she is your only daughter isnt she haygreth haygreth did not turn to face raskolf she is i have a daughter of my own haygreth said raskolf lowering his blade i think there has been more than enough killing today since we are at war we should consider saving some death for another day dont you think haygreth made no reply but he stopped walking i will return your daughter to you alive said raskolf if you call a truce to collect our dead and wounded and let us leave your territory unharassed haygreth clenched his hands into fists and shook a single tear rolled down his weathered features go he told his guards and get my daughter there has been enough bloodshed today summon the high priestess as well she has her work cut out for her  yawn awoke to see the sky rolling past his eyes the hard earth had jostled him awake painfully looking around he saw his packmates laid out beside him they were all lying on a piece of canvas and being dragged across an open field where am i croaked stanricks voice from somewhere next to him is this my funeral shroud yawn stretched painfully to see that one of the flaps of father aegeuss tent had blown over his face no stanrick said magrat from nearby you are inside the clerics tent although still weak from her wounds the injured syndar was channeling divine energy into nikolais face his numerous cuts and scrapes would heal it was his eye injury that she focused on there was no doubt that he would lose the eye wrapped in a bloody funeral shroud was the lifeless corpse of wigwald he had died in the great hall after preventing khulgar from finishing magrat he was young just a pup but he would be regarded as a warrior during his impending funeral pyre and his name would be sung to the great wolf as a hero azra dria and harlok limped along behind the canvas tarp although their wounds were bandaged they looked battered and bloodied all of them wore dark expressions as their thoughts were filled of the days to come  in the great hall of the nightriver clan branthur nightriver patiently awaited word on the summit with clan grimward kragen bloodmoon sat at his side the two faced the fire neither one said much they both feared the worst when the messenger hawk arrived branthur hesitated to unroll the text steeling himself he read the message aloud to kragen clan grimward has declared war on the colonists and killed diplomats of human factions nightriver longfang and watchwolf warriors were also killed in the fight shortsighted fools he roared i knew the treaty would only last so long especially with that lap dog khulgar yapping in haygreths ear your orders then old friend asked kragen as he bristled obviously attempting to hold back a foultempered snarl if he wants war then ill give him war call the pack leaders to my hall  there was much work to be done even if he had all the time in the world recent events were progressing much better than expected granted there were a few obstacles there were even a few loose ends but he would see to it that all of these things would be taken care of shortly news had spread like a plague as the heads of the colonist delegates were returned to each of the settlements in bags war had just been declared on mardrun the ulven as a nation and as a people were divided panic and fear would spread quickly amongst the refugees in the colony refugees already divided by race and creed at this thought he smiled as he walked briskly along the cobblestone road how could it have turned so wrong thought william first the undead drive us from our homeland then the waves of mordok come down upon us with unending ferocity trapping us within our walled cities as though besieged treaties are violated the ulven talk of war and now theres a lich here it is a nightmare that just gets worse and worse william reached for the dispatch from nightriver territory in addition to the appearance of the lich weighing heavily upon him the ulven of clan grimward had shed human blood an entire village was slaughtered with no chance to defend themselves there were already rumors of an army mobilizing for a counter attack into ulven territory led by the order of arnath raskolf vakr the watchwolf ambassador had asked william to help him organize a delegation to attend a peace summit in grimward territory before anyone did anything stupid like march an army across the border william of vandregon would not be attending in person as he was instead to appear before the order on a separate but related diplomatic mission namely he was to delay the war with the ulven and carry a report which would confirm the rumors of the undead which had certainly reached them by now in his place william had handpicked trusted delegates from new hope to attend the summit william had no proper writing desk and so sat staring at the surface of a humble wooden table a blank piece of parchment staring back at him since arriving back in new hope his mind had been troubled with the visions of what he had seen outside that abandoned fort  they rose we cut them down and they rose again i saw them with my own eyes they were dead the life in them gone but yet they rose gathered weapons and fought back our doom has followed us here those watchwolves were right and now they ask me to bring humanity together how im a soldier not a diplomat like raskolf our people are divided just as before if history is to repeat itself well it cannot there is nowhere left to run william reached for his mead and took a long swig pull it together william he whispered to himself your people need you now more then ever our enemies are beating down our door and we are at each others throats we must unite or we will be picked apart but they were right dammit he said out loud slamming his fist on the table and knocking his bottle of mead to the floor william buried his head in his hands they were right about what would happen and they were right about us we are a doomed race have our gods abandoned us william of vandregon boomed a powerful voice behind him startling him and causing him to spill his inkwell onto a pile of documents and maps please forgive me father william said spinning on the bench to face father aegeus the old cleric from crows landing we all have our doubts william snapped the old man but in your case such a thing must be your burden alone too many look to you for inspiration and leadership sir knight were the men you lead to see you in such a moment of doubt they could lose all hope trust me william i know im a shepherd myself after all and being a man of the cloth isnt so different from being a military leader as people might think when the skies darken and the enemy is breaking down the door our flocks look to us we are in their blackest hour their last hope these missions are perhaps the most important tasks that you and i will ever perform in the service of humanity yes father aegeus thank you now sir knight please walk with me that you might introduce me to these other delegates you have selected and this raskolf of the watchwolves of course father after the two left the room the silence was broken only by the patter of ink running off the desk and onto williams map of mardrun which had fallen to the floor the blackness silently spread unchecked across the new world until no amount of blotting or sanding could possibly remove it  by the way father said william please dont call me that call you what sir knight chuckled the old cleric that father i dont make my men call me that and i dont feel that an honored elder such as yourself should call me that either im just a soldier i fight because i believe that all men are created with certain inalienable rights i fight for equality equality you see is the keystone of unity and unity is the key to our survival humanity must not make the same mistake twice and yet sir knight said the cleric you call me father it is your title oh is it now smiled father aegeus i thought you respected me father exclaimed william of course i respect you it is a title that you have earned through a life dedicated to selfless service and personal sacrifice for the benefit of others exactly sir knight said the cleric and as i said before the role of a preacher is not so different from that of a military leader can you not see that you have embarked on a similar road to my own william your men love you they are inspired by you the bonds of brotherhood that you share with them were forged in battle where they looked to you for guidance and survival there is nothing wrong with acknowledging that in fact to make use of your title would further the cause for which you stand by helping you to gain influence with the lords and ladies no offense father said william in fact beg your pardon for what i am about to say but i detest politics i am a soldier i dont want to have anything to do with the lords and ladies of new hope and in fact i feel that they are part of the problem the arrogance of the upper class was what caused our alliance on faedrun to fall i am not like that i am a soldier father aegeus ground his teeth and took a deep breath fine then william he said many are called but some just dont have the stomach to do the right thing get back in the ranks then and stop standing in front youll be in good company father i go stand watch on the walls or something soldier father peace be with you william before william could respond father aegeus had pushed open the door to the ballroom where the rest of the delegation awaited and the sounds of chamber music laughter and idle chatter drifted into the hallway with the yellow light the door swung back bouncing a few times on the frame until william of vandregon found himself standing alone in the shadow clenching his fists  william went out on the ramparts to get some air venator met him on the wall come to check on the troops sir asked the ulven myrmidon yes thats it sighed william let us walk together so said venator as they made there way down the ramparts do we have any idea what they have planned for us what do you mean in the dinner that we are guarding sir said venator do you have any word on what they are talking about down there do we know what our role is to be besides serving as messengers to starkhaven are we to be used as escort guards some of the others were asking how secure the roads are in this area since humanitys old foes have returned i told them i did not know but that you would probably be able to tell us soon william stopped walking you know what venator he said placing an arm upon his friends shoulder you check on the troops i have other duties that i must attend to william went to his study he stared at the blank piece of parchment in front of him for a moment then fetched a new inkwell when in the course of human events and human survival it becomes necessary to reassess the political bonds which have in the past failed to protect the people of whom said institutions have been allowed to govern he began we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal when he was done he dried the ink rolled up the scroll and changed into clean clothes they had just finished serving horsdoeuvres father aegeus had saved him a seatmagrat farwalker yawn longfang magrat stared out into the darkness as if the answers to her questions could be found out there they had accepted her she traced the fang symbol on the flag he had given her this could change everything this meant she was pack now she never asked for it she did as she was asked she did as she would have ever done for her people in a way they were the closest she had felt to home in so very many years but to join them would that not mean abandoning her people before it was merely the oath of hunters of allies bonded on the field dissolved in absence to be a longfang meant to live as a longfang not as a lost she would now need to take their side in any decisions they made no matter the side they chose she was not sure she was ready for this but she would have a place if not a tribe again then a pack her mind drifted back to the night of the lichs ritual their forms gathered about her guarding as she struggled to regain some of the energy she had expended fighting the dead she had not asked them to wait they merely did no one had waited for her in a very long time she struggled through her watch straining to reconcile two cultures so vastly different and yet still so similar her watch was long but her answers were longer yet in coming stanrick relieved her of her post and she sought the oblivion of her bedroll and the peace of sleep but her dreams brought no comfort she was running it was all you could do when the revenants came around her people from her past ran too slow too slow one by one they were dragged down and one by one they joined the host that pursued then there was blackness and wind and rain and water everywhere she was safe she had left them far behind gathered around her now were a new people the warg children they were fighting the mordok came in waves and were slaughtered but then the fallen mordok began to get up their torn faces rotted and snarling and from behind their lines it rose it was like the mordok black skinned and dressed in the skins of its kills but its face was her nightmare every undead she ever fled from every undead she ever destroyed they all burned within its eyes the lich waded into the ranks of the warg children they died like leaves in the fall and as they fell so did they rise again to tear at the throats of their mates and children then the longfang came for her twisted dead puppets and she felt their fangs as she had felt the revenants teeth long ago magrat woke gasping for breath and clutching her dagger the campfire flickered her pack mates slumbered and watched against the night she buried her face in her hands spirits of my ancestors not here not again  yawn had been carving a branch into the start of his wooden knife the one hed need and playing on an off again with fitting it with flakes from the obsidian shard hed been carrying for luck yawn was full of superstitions he always made sure his sword arm didnt match his shield arm he only cleaned and scoured his mace by moon light the better for gaia to see his efforts rill had given him a ceramic tub of salve said to bring luck to wanders or at least thats what rill had told him which was truth enough for yawn he set aside the half finished branch the edge and end of the mock blade only just becoming distinct yawn waited a beat the question swelling in his chest he walked over and knelt laying a hand carefully along the crook of magrats arm magrat where were you he started to ask questions of her because she seemed strong then because it was said her knowing could be useful having seen the lich having fought it he knew it may very well make or break the future for the longfangs but that was before hed asked her to teach him before she became a friend right now all yawn cared about was his friend and what troubled her what robbed her of sleep would you tell me as i told you once he could feel the fear the worry and it was thick it throbbed and ached  magrat glanced up at yawn she laid her hand on his for a moment she didnt know if she could ever fully explain to them and if she could if the longfang would even understand she shook herself banishing the fog of the nightmare away and unwrapped her hand from the hilt of her dagger i saw death she sighed when had she gotten so melodramatic i dreamt of the undead back home killing everyoneeveryone becoming the dead then i dreamt of the warg childrenyou the ulven they were slaughtering mordok but every one that fell stood up again and began to kill ulven she drew a hissing breath the fallen ulven rose too and began to eat their children and their mates eventually even you the longfang came for me i felt your fangs in my throat she rubs the spot on her neck where years before a revenant had savaged her almost killing her sometimes she could almost still feel it magrat looked at yawn in entreaty we have to stop it we must i have never been cursed with foresight but if this filth is not destroyed this will happen everything that went wrong back home on faedrun will happen here in your home yawn i am terrified of this lich i cannot allow this to happen not again not while i can stop it  yawn listened feeling the words weight the thought clawed at his stomach fear heavy as lead thick and colds in its bottom not so long as i draw breath but i yawn felt the words slipping from him how did you say all youd learn had become a bell with out a clapper it kept him alive but just i couldnt harm it i cornered it lob a stone half the size of my chest and nothing i knew then with absolute certainty i think i felt the truth of your words before but it feel home then my arm my shield can only keep me alive not quell them yawn looked into magrats eyes when we are done withe the business of the grey tides i i will go to my trails i will go in to black into the dirge swamp as far as my legs will carry me i will find my totem and i will learn to call the spirits to put down the deadimara lasthopelarpstanrick longfangstanrick longfang the night was cold and damp as it got darker the chill permeated flesh and seemed to go straight to the bone it wasnt late in the season yet but the last few nights had been miserably cold imara stood at the fire pit in the courtyard she looked up at the keep an hour ago three ulven had walked in and now only one had come out she watched as he walked around the top of the wall toward the back gate he talked to the green syndar for a bit then she left him to his watch imara didnt know his name but she had fought alongside him the previous night she thought that perhaps she had heard someone call him stanley but that didnt sound like an ulven name she had been warned that the ulven were savage barbarians and that as a young woman she should watch her back around them from what shed seen the previous night however this ulven warrior seemed to have her back and in fact had possibly even saved her from injury or death with the strength of his shield arm besides who could be afraid of a barbarian named stanley gathering her courage imara decided to talk to him and see if he was hungry imara went up the steps and to see if he needed anything but when she got to where she last saw him he was gone she strained to see in the moonless dark of night but her eyes could not adjust to the black it was quiet but suddenly the hair on the back of her neck prickled and she sensed someone behind her she crouched and her hand instinctively went to her sword but before she could so much as get her proper stance a strong arm forced itself under her own and across her chest the hand covering her mouth and jaw she started to struggle but the steel below her chin was so cold that it froze her in place a deep voice whispered to her draw your blade and it will be your last act imara didnt move and kept her hand on her sword waiting to see if he would say more but all that she felt was his slow breath in her ear she slowly took her hand away for her sword smart human he said lowering his steel now he said spinning her around and pinning her against the wall then suddenly backing away why did you come up here imaras hand searched for the hilt of her sword but it was gone the ulven had somehow disarmed her when he spin her around think before you speak he whispered inspecting her blade today was not the first time ive spilled human blood she tried to swallow but her mouth was dry i had noticed you have been up here on watch a long time i came to see if you needed anything i brought some bread stanrick took the bread and sniffed it before taking a bite he didnt smell anything dangerous on it satisfied he approached to within inches of imaras face grinned at her and put her sword back in its sheath himself rather than hand it to her she stayed against the wall afraid that her shivering knees would betray her fear if she didnt have something to lean against she watched him eat she was angry and embarrassed that the ulven had snuck up on her dont be embarrassed he said imaras eyes got wide fearing he may have somehow been able to read her mind or perhaps that in her nervous state she had said something out loud i saw you walking this way he said ulven eyes see much in the dark and i could smell your fear and hear the apprehension in your step he took a bite of the bread but i should thank you imara stopped leaning against the wall and stood straight up she squared her shoulders raised her chin and arched her back posturing to appear bigger and more confident the body language was lost on stanrick however who only really noticed that she was sticking her chest out at him youre welcome she said do you need any water or i can keep watch for a while if youre tired her body was restless stanrick looked her up and down as he swallowed the last piece of bread you are welcome to stay and keep me company if you wish he looked out to the forest or you can run away imara looked into the dark woods i dont run she was not quite sure what to make of this ulven who had put a knife to her throat and now invited her to stay and share his watch he glanced at her and grinned his teeth glinting in the moonlight you know i could kill you with my hand alone do you mean to tell me that you are not scared imara turned and looked him dead in the eye i stopped running a long time ago besides i know youre a longfang and you will honor the treaty as long as i also honor it this response surprised him and he raised an eyebrow true i have no ill will to you imara relaxed her posture a bit maybe this ulven was not as mean as she first thought she handed him her water skin here she said its the last of the ginger wine they brought in with us he sniffed the skin then took a drink thank you he said she tried to stand still but she was restless constantly chewing her lower lip and fiddling with her hands she began to pace after a few minutes if you fidget too much then you wont hear when gaia warns you of an attack stanrick said the leaves on the aspen trees rustled in the cold damp wind imara pulled her cloak closer around her i guess im still a bit worked up from our battle tonight there were so many of them and a lich how can that be stanrick frowned he wanted to say the humans brought it with them but he bit his tongue come here human that thin cloak will not keep you warm in this dampness imara paused confused to the abrupt change in subject but then realized that she was very obviously shivering ill be ok she stammered shivering even harder one of the men said that the lich makes his army from the dead growled stanrick if you freeze to death i will see to it that your body is burned to spare you from that fate imara didnt know what to do she looked at him but he didnt return her gaze instead he stared off into the night and sighed imara couldnt handle it anymore she hoped she wouldnt regret this later as she approached him he opened his cloak the scent of leather and fresh tobacco emanated from within and she could already feel the heat coming off of him wrapping her inside his cloak he put his arm around her before hed been clad in heavy leather armor but now he just had a tunic and belt imara couldnt believe the heat that radiated off him this was so awkward and yet she leaned into his body grateful for the warmth and unsure of how she was supposed to feel or what her people would think if they knew she had not been this close to a male outside of hostile encounters at least for a long time it was comforting but she almost felt weak for indulging in that comfort its just for warmth she told herself they sat down on a box leaning against the wall stanrick watched the forest and listed to the wind all was quiet except for an owl in a far off tree judging by her heart rate imara had either been terrified or really excited to climb into his outer garments but now he could feel her heart beat return to normal imara gave in she was indulging herself by taking in his body heat ulven must be warmer by nature she leaned into him a bit more relaxing suddenly realizing how tired she was no shame in sleeping he whispered if anything happens i can wake you no im fine thank you though but the longer they sat listening to the wind the heavier her eyes got until she had drifted off to sleep cuddled up to him he smiled to himself happy for the touch in the frozen nightit had been a hard journey from new aldoria but she had survived as had the others it had been a close thing though uncomfortably close drifa pulled the blanket tighter around her shoulders as she stared into the fire she was tired of travelling day in day out for someone whod never ventured far from her home territory the last several months had been a shock shed never imagined mardrun would be this big leagues and leagues with no end all the time watching and waiting for the ambush from mordok or bandits or even worse their supposed allies allies she snorted shaking her head more like headaches the longer drifa spent around humans the less she understood them always rushing about and panicking halfhysterical most of the time so dramatic how could raskolf stand dealing with them so much they never listened bickering and squabbling with each other like spoiled cubs fighting over the choicest teat and arrogant shed never been so angry as at the first outpost theyd stopped at when theyd looked down their noses at her their upper lips curled as if smelling something foul her efforts in the smithy had been redoubled that night and her arms and back had paid the price for it the next day rage wasnt as useful a tool as folks made it out to be there was always a price and sometimes the price was awfully heavy some of the humans were pleasant enough true but others were just abrasive and rude honor did not seem to be a commonlyheld concept among humans and dealings with them always seemed barbed like the worm in a ripe apple she sighed and tucked her skirt around her feet settling herself more comfortably against the chill perhaps she was just being paranoid there were good and bad apples the world over and one shouldnt cut down an apple tree over a handful of rotten fruit she picked up a stick and stirred the fire sending up a shower of sparks no one shouldnt judge an entire group by the failings of a few drifa had been on the receiving end of that kind of judgment for a long time until shed finally found a clan that would take her in the sense of pride shed felt when shed been accepted by the watchwolves washed over her again no other clan had opened their home to her no other clan had welcomed her and healed her hurts and made her one of them her drifa blackfrost the last member of a dead clan a clan the ulven believed had been cursed by gaia for their blasphemy she never knew what rite their clan priestess had performed and had never felt brave enough to ask the high priestess ravensmark but on the fateful night that old utta brightmoon the clan winterclaw priestess had performed her strange ritual the mordok had come boiling out of the forest like hornets slaughtering her people in numbers shed never believed possible she could still hear the old womans voice cracked and papery lifting gaeas protection and blessings from her clan calling down gaeas vengeance upon them tears streaming openly down her wrinkled face until a mordok spear buried itself in her throat she could still hear the shrieks of the children the fierce gruff battlecries of the warriors the clash of steel and the dull sickening thud of the club that dashed her fathers brains across the snow she remembered blood blood on the snow and the discordant ululating screams of the unclean ones that sound woke her from sleep more often than she cared to admit and it frightened her to the core of her being she would do anything to avoid hearing it again anything but yet here she was traipsing through the whole of mardun with people who fought mordok and dead things that didnt stay dead but walked and dead mages who didnt stay dead but cast spells and other such horrors drifa didnt fight mordok drifa didnt fight anything there was a reason that drifa blackfrost was the only surviving member of her clan drifa blackfrost was alive because she ran the thought shamed her but she didnt regret it running was the only way she could have survived she could remember her father and her mate and their pack loping back into their village with the heads of the unclean ones mounted on their spears and victory painted on their faces theyd raided a mordok nest and looted it taken trophies from the dead and goods in retribution for raids on their own camps she could remember the angry words of priestess brightmoon her eyes flashing and her gnarled hands clasping her staff in rage as she berated drifas chieftain father for his packs heresy her fathers laughter and gruff dismissal of her words the pack began raiding in earnest ranging wider and wider with their war parties and always the trophies always the proof of their conquests heads and ears and claws and trinkets crude idols and tools soon the whole clan was participating in helmingur blackfrosts depredations despite the warnings of their priestess it was a foggy new moon night utta brightmoon performed her dark ritual and the death of clan winterclaw came to pass shed never figured out how the mordok had missed her as wild as her flight through the misty forest had been shed run until shed dropped from exhaustion the next morning dawned pale and wan the sun obscured by rank smoke fearful drifa had retraced her steps crept carefully back to the ruins of her clans village nothing but atrocities greeted her there were no other survivors that she could find a long period followed of aimless wandering being driven away by other clans frightened of suffering the same fate as the winterclaws before falling into the warm welcoming open arms of the watchwolves whod given her a home and a purpose drifa was thankful for a purpose shed never had one before and the novelty pleased her images of a frustrating youth a youth spent trying to be something she could never be her swordsmanship was poor her shield work worse shed never gotten the hang of weaving or sewing and a meal prepared by her lessthanable hands would cause even the most ravenous to declare a fast shed managed to become moderately competent in treating injuries but shed never truly mastered the art and the complexities of herb lore baffled her in short shed never really been very good at anything however shed learned that avoiding uncomfortable situations was preferential to bearing the shame of mediocrity so avoidance became almost second nature to her drifa became talented at deferring at drifting like the drifting snow she was named for falling into the path of least resistance now she had found something she was a little bit good at smithing was fun and useful she could only do simple repairs now but had hopes of becoming if not good at least competent rhodi vakr the clan smith seemed to think there was hope for her and she could truly contribute to her pack and clan for the first time it was a wonderful feeling she yawned baring fangs that gleamed wetly in the firelight maybe that feeling was worth braving armies of mordok and dead things and mages that wouldnt stay dead and rude humans and strange syndar and sore feet and tired muscles maybeambassador how long are we going to travel with this lot of stanrick said ending his sentence with a grimace and a disgusted wave of his hand as he looked out at the motley merchant baggage train and its mercenary bodyguards stanrick said raskolf there is safety in numbers although i understand your concern they are noisy enough to attract every bandit for three leagues but i consider it good fortune that our paths have crossed i know some of these adventurers personally i have fought alongside the men of crows landing in the past they may look a bit rough around the edges but they are honorable warriors im just concerned about your safety ambassador as well as that of your daughter replied stanrick i appreciate that friend the sun horse is soon descending to the western horizon however and i wouldnt mind having the protection of this outpost that they seek rather than making camp in strange territory with all due respect ambassador im not sure i like the idea of being locked inside a fortress with this mercenary rabble and that fat greedy merchant your concerns are noted before long the slow noisy baggage train crested a hill and the tower of the main keep could be seen in the distance the fortress was overgrown and neglected according to the merchant it had been regularly garrisoned until recently yet it appeared that the forest itself was trying to swallow it up the walls were covered in vines snaking tree branches tippmann moss and marbilizer fungus it looked older than it was the baggage train came to a halt as two of the longfang scouts emerged from the woods off the trail mordok reported dria azra and i counted nine mordok on the ground inside the keep and four on the west ramparts to the north of the main entrance the doors seem to be missing from the front gate we could see clearly to the courtyard inside the ones on the ground were worshipping a strange idol until they heard the baggage train coming added azra they have surely seen us by now orders sir asked stanrick motioning for harlock and the rest of the security detail to move up to the front of the formation we strike now quickly before the defenders have time to organize shouted raskolf every warrior with a shield form up on the left and interlock they may have archers on the wall to the north of the gate longfangs adventurers move out raskolf trudged down the dirt road toward the yawning front gate of the fortress less than a stones throw behind the clattering charge of mercenaries and longfang warriors as he sized up the situation he took a moment to glance over his shoulder and ensure that the baggage train was protected rhodi was unwrapping his maul and directing a security formation around the merchants cart thanks brother he muttered raskolf drew his pitted weathered blade and strode through the open gate into the back of the formation the warriors were squaring off against a dozen or so mordok one mordok already lay dying in the courtyard pierced by arrows stay in formation shouted stanrick dont let them draw you out as the arrows of magrat farwalker and the hooded mercenary named duncan found their marks in yet another mordok the other creatures panicked and closed with the formation steel rang out against bone bronze and wood as the primitive and scavenged weapons of the mordok traded blows with the formation hold the line shouted raskolf as two of his bodyguards broke ranks to follow a mordok the two warriors fell back just in time they were almost flanked and cut off but made it safely back into formation more and more mordok fell until there were only a handful of them left and they clustered together in a desperate last stand to defend a small ugly idol topped with a skull now shouted aradael the captain from crows landing surround them as the formation broke ranks to form a ring one of the mordok suddenly dropped his weapons and made a dash for the center of the keep raskolf intercepted the creature and felt his blade bite deeply into its flesh but the monster kept going even as its own momentum disemboweled it and nearly twisted the blade from raskolfs hand with its dying effort the creature leapt for a rope and clung to it with a death grip swinging wildly back and forth for a few seconds before crumpling and rolling to a stop stone dead the bells of the keep rang out loudly they could surely be heard for many a mile raskolf turned to see that the last of the mordok had gone down it was quiet for a moment save the resonance of the bells and the heavy breathing of the victors aradael said raskolf take your men and secure the front gate stanrick harlock take the rest of the longfangs and guard the back gate archers take the walls everyone else go fetch the baggage train before mordok reinforcements arrive elise had been told to stay with drifa her uncle rhodis apprentice while camp was being set up in the courtyard but what self respecting seven year old could sit by and let these fascinating ruins go unexplored drawing her short sword and clinging to her little basket of bandages she waited until no one was looking and climbed the stairs to the second floor of the main keep curious thought duncan as he scouted the ruins all the doors are missing up here too nothing but empty doorways everywhere this place must have been looted already the veteran scout caught movement out of the corner of his eye and spun to face it it was the ulven ambassadors little girl duncan smiled as the tiny armored figure trampled noisily into an open bedroom sword in hand slinging his bow he placed a hand on the hilt of his sword and followed her in the room was dusty and littered with papers torn parchment fluttered in the wind as he entered the room the little girl was crouched down beside an overturned bed examining a small figurine there was a set of clothes on the floor filled with ash the outline of the ash was the shape of a person but there were no scorch marks on the floor and the clothes were not burnt suddenly the little ulven girl jumped to her feet and scurried back out onto the ramparts duncan knelt down and began gathering up the papers raskolf was in the courtyard examining the strange idol that the mordok had tried to defend it was a small wicker pillar topped with a crudely carved skull there really didnt seem to be anything remarkable about it the craftsmanship was poor and it didnt look very old at all he conferred with some of the others about it and learned that the mordok in this area had a tendency to decorate things with skulls on the one hand this trinket looked harmless enough but then again with all the problems that the statue boomhowlers sons had found had caused raskolf was uneasy around these things father father said elise tugging at his cloak i found something upstairs what should we do with this thing someone asked as raskolf turned his back on the strange idol burn it he barked over his shoulder duncan was disappointed with the documents hed found they didnt seem to be anything more than supply manifests receipts and some boring personal correspondence as he was just about to drop them his eyes drifted up and spotted the locked chest against the south wall of the room maybe this place wasnt looted after all he thought duncan smiled and took a few steps toward the chest but was interrupted by the arrival of the ambassador and his daughter the blacksmiths apprentice and a human dressed in a black hooded cloak accompanied them the ambassador paid no mind to duncan and instead crouched down to examine the burnt body look father said the little girl its a little wooden animal i think that is a lion said the man in black it is a creature from faedrun it is also the sign of the order right said duncan well your little girl found these papers so i guess that they are hers so are those trinkets by the bed elise smiled and shrugged picking up the little animal figurines and placing them in her basket no elise said raskolf we do not take things from the dead those clothes on the floor used to belong to a body see the ashes oblivious to the fact that she had discovered a dead person elise was simply disappointed that her father was not letting her keep any of the little treasures she had found i dont like this place something bad happened here magic was involved raskolf muttered standing up and searching the room with his eyes yes well maybe you can get to the bottom of this duncan laughed thrusting the papers in the direction of the ambassador then grinning sheepishly and retracting them before raskolf could take them oops i mean here you go sir he said handing them instead to the man in black i can read growled raskolf oh said duncan it has been my experience that very few of your people can it has been my experience snapped raskolf that very few of your people have any manners right then laughed duncan well ill be taking my share and moving on then you shouldnt take anything that belongs to the dead grumbled raskolf but duncan was already stepping through the empty doorway with the locked chest in his arms we need a priestess said raskolf to drifa this is a bad place down in the courtyard people were still investigating the idol burn it said raskolf simpleton bellowed the fat merchant need i remind you all that this is my expedition and as the sole investor that artifact is my personal property burn it repeated raskolf we must do no such thing exclaimed a syndar priest crouched near the idol he had gold colored skin and was armored in black and shining silver this could be an artifact of great and dangerous power destroying it could release that power raskolf stopped in his tracks fine then dont burn it tie it into a sack with some rocks and sink it into the swamp you must not touch it exclaimed the syndar priest why not asked raskolf clearly sir you have no idea what this is do you are you frightened of it no and yes can you tell me anything about it no but i am going to attempt to commune with it through solar if it is an undead idol or one of a death god i may be able to speak with it is that wise asked drifa what if you are successful you may awaken something i fail to see how this is safer than started drifa but the syndar had taken a seat on the earth eye level with the idol and begun to chant the priest made some strange gestures and then clapped his hands together in front of his face his eyes were closed raskolf stepped back and told drifa and elise to go over by rhodi and help him set up his camp whats he doing asked yawn one of the longfang bodyguards hes conducting some kind of blasphemous ritual to try to talk to this thing he said something about death gods that sounds dangerous should we stop him ambassador just leave him be it isnt going to work anyway his gods probably dont have any power here besides im convinced this thing is just some mordok icon send a patrol to reconnoiter the area before we settle down for the night are we staying sir im thinking we will when that mordok rang the bell he summoned all of his tribe i am sure as much as i dont like this place id rather meet them here in a fortress than out on the open road a group this large would be easy for them to track that reminds me ambassador a scouting party found one of the doors to the front gate they are trying to figure out how to hang it ill get rhodi on it said raskolf walking away from the meditative syndar and the ugly little idol tell the others to keep looking for the other door  elise was combing the area immediately surrounding the outpost looking for yellow flowers the healer lady who talked funny had sent her on this errand elise had almost filled her basket with every yellow flower she could find but every time she and drifa returned to the healer the woman told her that she had picked the wrong flowers and sent her back out elise was starting to get frustrated she gathered medicinal herbs and flowers for her mother all the time back home and never had this problem this healer ladys funny accent made her difficult to understand and the lady didnt seem to be all that great at describing what she was looking for anyway elise may have only been seven years old but she was fairly certain that she had brought samples of every yellow flower with healing properties that grew in the region two of the types of flowers she had collected were commonly used in the treatment of infections but the healer lady didnt want them elise was beginning to suspect that this healer didnt know much about what grew in the region maybe the yellow flowers she was looking for were something that only grew on the ladys side of the ocean eventually elise gave up and headed back to the fortress with drifa on the way back in the pair passed aradael and the other troops from crows landing they were heading out to find the other door to the front gate rhodi had managed to hang the first one already raskolf had just finished doing a perimeter check he had placed archers on the walls troops at each gate and collaborated with aradael and fortinbras to see about finding the other front door and securing rocks for the ramparts in the event that the fortress were attacked raskolf sat down to take a break and fetch his pipe from his backpack the syndar were still investigating the idol well he thought to himself at least they arent letting anyone touch it i guess that is sort of like guarding it as raskolf dug through his backpack he noticed the skulking misshapen form of the fat merchants deformed retainer the man was scrawny hunchbacked and seemed to have a perpetually scrunched up face twisted in such a manner as to appear as though he had stuffed slices of wild rhubarb and green onions into his cheeks while he was sniffing the backside of a skunk he leaned heavily on a gnarled staff as he scuttled along excuse me sir said raskolf are you from this area i have some questions about the mordok in this region the hunchback looked frightened he cautiously approached craning his long skinny neck around to do the closest thing he could to looking over his shoulder given his limitations less than a stones throw away the merchant was trying to close a deal with rhodi over the sale of some alcohol raskolf vakr said raskolf extending his forearm in greeting raskolf was about to continue formally by introducing himself by clan camp pack and title but he stopped himself when he saw the apprehension in the hunchbacks eye it was quiet for a moment the merchants retainer made no effort to clasp forearms nor did he respond verbally this is the part where you introduce yourself sir said raskolf nobody talks to us whimpered the hunchback except the master and only when he needs someone to yell at thats not right said raskolf why do you tolerate such an injustice we should not be talking to you rasped the retainer looking to see if the merchant had noticed why not are you a man or simply a piece of property master owns us how dreadful said raskolf and here i thought maybe you could help me no no we cannot help you we cannot please leave us before we get in trouble with master how disgusting that any man should live in such fear and hopelessness as to where he cannot even help himself let alone another who has shown him courtesy and compassion it is not so bad said the hunchback what of personal honor sir said raskolf he pays us fairly just to stand next to him so he looks taller and more handsome because we are so wretched sometimes he hurts us but it is a living no man should have to suffer such cruelties it is a living what else can we do when we are so hideous i dont imagine we will ever find out unless you find the courage to discover that for yourself im a soldier at heart man while i may have empathized with your misfortune i have no pity for cowards you whine as though you are a prisoner but i see neither chains nor shackles upon you good day as raskolf left the hunchback to his misery there was a sudden commotion at the rear gate an old man was being helped into the keep by two of the longfangs he looked exhausted caravan he panted caravan under attack by bandits raskolf called his personal detachment of longfang and watchwolf bodyguards to arms and sprinted down the trail towards the main road as they neared the road the ulven fanned out into a silent skirmish formation and slowed down the bandits could be heard through the trees carousing and tearing into the spoils of their catch on the road the ulven approached the edge of the woods like a pack of wolves instinctively creating an ambush with the more lightly armored watchwolves moving further to the north in order to cut off escape on the road and the more heavily armored longfangs advancing from the west to hit the careless brigands in the flank without any signal the ulven launched their attack the panicked bandits tried to flee towards the swamp to the north leaving a trail of abandoned chests crates and sacks of loot in their wake but found themselves cut off where the road narrowed as the two forces squared off raskolf shouted out to the thieves to identify themselves but was answered only with an arrow that harlock nonchalantly intercepted with his shield harlock roared in defiance and bared his fangs the other ulven followed suit and a few of the bandits began to shiver with fear the bandits though lightly armed were dressed in uniform tabards the tabards were green and bore a dagger device raskolf did not recognize the heraldry they were certainly not vandregonian and neither did they appear to be aldorian though the green was similar i am raskolf vakr he shouted ulven ambassador the voice of the watchwolves and the warder of the high priestess anjan ravensmark and i speak with the authority of the clan the eyes and the ears of the watchwolves are upon you and you will be judged now tell me whose colors do you bear and who do you represent the bandits didnt answer instead they drew steel and formed up back to back it was a military formation clearly these were trained men militia perhaps but who did they work for dria azra shouted raskolf to the two longfang scouts sweep the woods and make sure there arent any more of them hiding out there ylsa look for survivors from the caravan raskolf stared into the frightened eyes of the bandit leader if you will not identify yourselves then i will assume that you are bandits and thieves the men still refused to answer steel rang out against steel as the longfangs and watchwolves of raskolfs security detachment clashed with the bandits the bandits did not last long they tried to interlock into a shield wall but lacked the long weapons necessary to make such a formation effective and were quickly ground into the earth by the fury of the ulven charge the formation rapidly disintegrated and several smaller skirmishes broke out as the men tried to flee the ulven warriors as the ulven consolidated their victory the sharp eyes of the scouts made out the form of a man trying to escape through the swamp without hesitation raskolf ordered three of his longfang bodyguards to follow him and he ran off in pursuit of the escaping bandit for a moment raskolfs body protested the sudden burst of speed and his breath came in ragged gasps but then he got his rhythm and felt as though born anew indeed he could run all day he could run all night he would never tire for he was ulven and to be ulven was to be half wolf raskolf could smell the panic in the air of his quarry as it panted and cried casting away bits of armor and dropping its weapons in an effort to lighten itself in doing so it had thrown away any chance of fighting it was no longer an adversary it was no longer a person it was prey something primal flickered in the base of raskolfs brain it was the part of him that was wolf raskolf had to chase it he couldnt resist there was no longer any reasoning there was no longer any risk assessment there was only the chase nothing else mattered not the fact that he was running blindly into unexplored territory nor the fact that he had outpaced his bodyguards no none of that mattered raskolf licked his fangs he could smell the salt in the air as his prey perspired and tears ran down its desperate panting crying face raskolf though more heavily encumbered than his prey was tireless as he paced and harried it through swamp and through forest doubling back towards the main road to the abandoned mine delighting and reveling in the squeals of anguish every time his prey looked back over his shoulder and met his gaze raskolf had no idea where the rest of his pack was and he didnt care he wouldnt lose this prey hed take it down himself if he had to raskolf stayed just far enough back to make his prey think that it might have a chance if only it could maintain the interval but of course such hope is folly when chased by wolves suddenly just as spontaneously as it began the chase was over the prey stumbled and fell wheezing and panting and clutching at its chest raskolf bared his fangs and was about to leap onto it when the mans eyes met his own and suddenly raskolf realized what had happened and froze for a moment the two men stared at each other and raskolf saw his own snarling face reflected in the watery eyes of the old man hed chased like an animal the mans face was ashen and sweaty and his lips were blue all color drained from his features the man began coughing violently and then shuddered as all muscle tone left his face and he slumped to the ground in an unnatural position his eyes staring blankly through raskolfs own the elderly mans chest made one final wheezy rattle as the breath left his lungs for the last time as raskolf stared into the blank unblinking eyes of the corpse he found himself suddenly embarrassed by his bloodlust he quickly regained his senses and the fatigue of his frenzy hit him suddenly causing him to fall to one knee the only other time that this had ever happened to him was when the tundra wolves were destroyed was this his legacy was this his glory running off because he had to chase something that ran surely that wasnt his aspect of the wolf running into an obvious trap and getting his friends killed frightening an old man to death when the wolf took control of others they achieved legendary feats of heroism to be forever remembered in song but not raskolf he just chased things that wasnt even a wolf aspect it was that of a common dog a hound as he sat and caught his breath raskolf realized that he was being watched the hunchback cowered behind a fallen log like frightened rabbit afraid to move lest it trigger a chase like the one that had just transpired the hunchback carried with him a paychest and his traveling bundles for a moment they stared at each other the hunchback cowered at the sight of raskolfs panting foaming visage and was unable to meet the ulvens blazing eyes with his own you better get out of here said raskolf struggling to make words from the growls barks and snarls boiling in the back of his throat the rest of my pack is right behind me dont ever look back dont ever look back on any of this the hunchback stared at him wild eyed and jaw agape thank you and thank you again he muttered as he scrambled over the fallen logs and headed deeper into the forest raskolf averted his eyes lest he lose himself again and give chase simply because the hunchback was moving raskolf wiped the foam from his lips and concentrated on regaining his composure he was glad elise hadnt seen that the eyes and ears however surely had he may have outrun his guards but there was no way that he could have possibly outrun actual wolves a few minutes later raskolfs bodyguards finally caught up to him some were limping from the run over such harsh terrain they were all exhausted and panting but they found raskolf standing tall over the body of his quarry you should be ashamed of yourselves he growled some of you are half my age and lightly armored to boot did you get anything out of him before you killed him asked ylsa i didnt kill him he dropped dead from exhaustion lets head back to the keep should we take a break first panted one of the longfangs no need said raskolf i already took one while i was waiting for you soft little pups to catch up lets go  stanrick yawn and some of the others had returned to the keep with crates and baggage from the caravan the scouts hadnt found any survivors besides the old man who had run to the keep to alert them of the attack there were tracks leading off into the swamp though so it was possible that there were others out there somewhere upon his arrival drifa had tended to the old man until his pulse slowed to a normal pace he caught his breath and his withered hands ceased to tremble the human had thanked drifa for helping to calm his poor old heart and for sitting with him until he felt better it had almost been a legitimate compliment until he called her a noble savage and made a seemingly absentminded remark that perhaps ulven werent all bloodthirsty animals after all drifa rolled her eyes and attributed it to dementia the old man now sipped hot tea and conversed with the fat merchant about the old country he kept on introducing himself to the same people over and over again his name was jack the sun was starting to get low in the sky her work done drifa took her leave of the old man and settled by the fire it wasnt late in the season yet but it was looking to be a cold damp evening and her bones ached equal parts from the weather the walking and her work repairing weapons and armor with the portable smithy it had been a hard journey from new aldoria but she had survived as had the others it had been a close thing though uncomfortably close drifa pulled the blanket tighter around her shoulders as she stared into the fire she was tired of travelling day in day out for someone whod never ventured far from her home territory the last several months had been a shock shed never imagined mardrun was this big leagues and leagues with no end all the time watching and waiting for the ambush from mordok or bandits or even worse their supposed allies allies she snorted shaking her head more like headaches the longer drifa spent around humans the less she understood them always rushing about and panicking halfhysterical most of the time so dramatic how could raskolf stand dealing with them so much they never listened bickering and squabbling with each other like spoiled cubs fighting over the choicest teat and arrogant shed never been so angry as at the first outpost theyd stopped at when theyd looked down their noses at her their upper lips curled as if smelling something foul her efforts in the smithy had been redoubled that night and her arms and back had paid the price for it the next day rage wasnt as useful a tool as folks made it out to be there was always a price and sometimes the price was awfully heavy some of the humans were pleasant enough true but others were just abrasive and rude honor did not seem to be a commonlyheld concept among humans and dealings with them always seemed barbed like the worm in a ripe apple drifa glanced over at the old man shed helped she was glad that she didnt have raskolfs job she wasnt nearly as good at dealing with humans as he was she sighed and tucked her skirt around her feet settling herself more comfortably against the chill perhaps she was just being paranoid there were good and bad apples the world over and one shouldnt cut down an apple tree over a handful of rotten fruit she picked up a stick and stirred the fire sending up a shower of sparks no one shouldnt judge an entire group by the failings of a few drifa had been on the receiving end of that kind of judgment for a long time until shed finally found a clan that would take her in the sense of pride shed felt when shed been accepted by the watchwolves washed over her again no other clan had opened their home to her no other clan had welcomed her and healed her hurts and made her one of them her drifa blackfrost the last member of a dead clan a clan the ulven believed had been cursed by gaia for their blasphemy she never knew what rite their clan priestess had performed and had never felt brave enough to ask the high priestess ravensmark but on the fateful night that old utta brightmoon the clan winterclaw priestess had performed her strange ritual the mordok had come boiling out of the forest like hornets slaughtering her people in numbers shed never believed possible she could still hear the old womans voice cracked and papery lifting gaeas protection and blessings from her clan calling down gaeas vengeance upon them tears streaming openly down her wrinkled face until a mordok spear buried itself in her throat she could still hear the shrieks of the children the fierce gruff battlecries of the warriors the clash of steel and the dull sickening thud of the club that dashed her fathers brains across the snow she remembered blood blood on the snow and the discordant ululating screams of the unclean ones that sound woke her from sleep more often than she cared to admit and it frightened her to the core of her being she would do anything to avoid hearing it again anything but yet here she was traipsing through the whole of mardun with people who fought mordok and dead things that didnt stay dead but walked and dead mages who didnt stay dead but cast spells and other such horrors drifa didnt fight mordok drifa didnt fight anything there was a reason that drifa blackfrost was the only surviving member of her clan drifa blackfrost was alive because she ran the thought shamed her but she didnt regret it running was the only way she could have survived she could remember her father and her mate and their pack loping back into their village with the heads of the unclean ones mounted on their spears and victory painted on their faces theyd raided a mordok nest and looted it taken trophies from the dead and goods in retribution for raids on their own camps she could remember the angry words of priestess brightmoon her eyes flashing and her gnarled hands clasping her staff in rage as she berated drifas chieftain father for his packs heresy her fathers laughter and gruff dismissal of her words the pack began raiding in earnest ranging wider and wider with their war parties and always the trophies always the proof of their conquests heads and ears and claws and trinkets crude idols and tools soon the whole clan was participating in helmingur blackfrosts depredations despite the warnings of their priestess it was a foggy new moon night utta brightmoon performed her dark ritual and the death of clan winterclaw came to pass shed never figured out how the mordok had missed her as wild as her flight through the misty forest had been shed run until shed dropped from exhaustion the next morning dawned pale and wan the sun obscured by rank smoke fearful drifa had retraced her steps crept carefully back to the ruins of her clans village nothing but atrocities greeted her there were no other survivors that she could find a long period followed of aimless wandering being driven away by other clans frightened of suffering the same fate as the winterclaws before falling into the warm welcoming open arms of the watchwolves whod given her a home and a purpose drifa was thankful for a purpose shed never had one before and the novelty pleased her images of a frustrating youth a youth spent trying to be something she could never be her swordsmanship was poor her shield work worse shed never gotten the hang of weaving or sewing and a meal prepared by her lessthanable hands would cause even the most ravenous to declare a fast shed managed to become moderately competent in treating injuries but shed never truly mastered the art and the complexities of herb lore baffled her in short shed never really been very good at anything however shed learned that avoiding uncomfortable situations was preferential to bearing the shame of mediocrity so avoidance became almost second nature to her drifa became talented at deferring at drifting like the drifting snow she was named for falling into the path of least resistance now she had found something she was a little bit good at smithing was fun and useful she could only do simple repairs now but had hopes of becoming if not good at least competent rhodi vakr the clans master smith seemed to think there was hope for her and she could truly contribute to her pack and clan for the first time it was a wonderful feeling she yawned baring fangs that gleamed wetly in the firelight maybe that feeling was worth braving armies of mordok rude humans strange syndar and sore feet and tired muscles maybe  raskolf and duncan stood together staring at the ugly idol the syndar priest had finally abandoned his efforts to talk to it or whatever he was doing raskolf chewed the end of his pipe why were you so eager to get rid of this thing asked duncan my people do not take things from the dead this idol belongs to the mordok nothing but misfortune will come from our taking it and the evil spirits of those we have slain will hound us relentlessly so long as we possess it duncan raised an eyebrow it is especially taboo said raskolf because it is a religious icon that makes it even worse duncan thought about it for a moment you know what he said i dont pretend to understand your religion ambassador but i think that you bring up an excellent point as long as we have this thing the mordok are going to be after it and i dont see how keeping it will do us any good as far as the argument that it shouldnt fall into the wrong hands well whos to say who that is it is a piece of wicker and clay it doesnt seem to be either magic or valuable so i dont see that it does any of us any good tell you what raskolf i am going to do you a favor look over there raskolf hesitated a moment then looked away when he looked back the idol was gone and duncan was walking away where are you going duncan asked raskolf im going out on patrol with the crows guard he said  it had been over an hour aradael fortinbras and other militia from crows landing were still searching for the other door to the keep or even a suitable substitute their archers had been left to stand watch upon the walls back at the keep the heavy platemail and chain of the fighters echoed in the stillness as they tramped along the dirt road to the old mine the woods were quiet far too quiet in fact duncan had tagged along with the party at first he had simply been enjoying the company of fellow adventurers but the farther the group got from the keep the more uncomfortable he became there was something wrong in this forest duncan was by trade a scout and explorer he had a knack for telling when something was wrong duncan began moving silently he slowly fell to the rear of the formation and then disappeared into the landscape his compatriots never noticed that he was gone nor did they realize that they were being stalked one of the harsh realities of the infantry soldier is that no matter how well trained or disciplined a unit is their chance of surviving a well organized ambush is almost zero from green volunteers and conscript troops to elite phalanxes of heavy footmen being on the receiving end of a proper ambush is near certain death especially if the attacker knows how to use the terrain to their advantage the majority of the crows landing militia were stuck full of arrows before they even realized the situation they were in aradael hadnt done anything wrong either infantry commanders are taught to take the low ground when maneuvering troops so as not to create silhouettes on the high ground it makes you harder to find sadly though in the event that you are found traveling the low ground makes a unit susceptible to attacks from the high ground theres a reason they call foot soldiers the poor bloody infantry duncan saw what was unfolding before it actually happened there was no time to waste he had already started running back to the keep for help before the first arrow was loosed but the screams and shouts of combat caught up with him as he ran  raskolf and his bodyguards returned to the keep to find the front doors hung and secured good job brother he said admiring rhodis craftsmanship in repairing the destroyed hinges and brackets of the first door who found the other one a couple of the mercenary types said they got it from an old woman who lives west of here she was using it for a table or something mercenaries great i suppose they expect someone to pay them for dragging it back i was hoping that aradael and fortinbras would have found it where are they they havent come back yet probably still out looking for the door chuckled rhodi hope they come back soon it will be getting dark raskolf checked with the longfangs and the remaining troops from crows landing who were pretty much all archers he sent the longfangs out on a short patrol of the immediate area and ordered them to be back before sunset guard rotations had been set up for the walls and the gates some of the adventurers had even collected a large cache of field stones and stacked them on the ramparts of the gatehouse in case the keep were besieged by mordok after the sun went down raskolf rhodi drifa and elise found some spots in the walls which were of questionable integrity and reinforced them with improvised timber shoring the architecture of this keep was different than the walled villages and stockades that raskolf was used to defending from mordok but he was confident that they could work with it the only thing that concerned him was the size of the fort it was too big there was too much wall too many towers and too many doors for the number of troops on hand it would be impossible to properly watch everything at once  not far away horus von horst examined the ruins of the abandoned mine the timber was still in excellent condition the mine had to be less than ten years old assuming it was built by colonists it didnt go very far down at all his companion and guide rory sturm examined the wall of dirt with a lit torch it wasnt a cave in he said picking at the dirt with his fingers it was never mined any further than here they built an entrance corridor but never actually started digging down look said horus pointing to a small mudclay figurine sitting on an unused beam partially buried by erosion natives he asked rory sturm adventurer and explorer knelt down and examined the crude humanoid lump of brown clay yes he hissed through clenched teeth mordok to be precise as the two men turned to leave the torchlight danced across the entry arch illuminating pictograms and runes that had remained hidden when they entered from that direction the two stared in wide eyed silence for a moment rory said horus what can you tell me about the mordok in this area they like to decorate things with a skull motiff these pictograms here are suspected to be representative of death or a death god and are typically found with offerings or sacrifices of small creatures this round little one is anyones guess but based on my personal travels and from what ive seen of other cultures it is likely a fertility character of some sort the big circle looks something like a round pregnant belly and the other circles are probably breasts death and rebirth muttered horus rummaging through his bag for his notebook these runes however he said are certainly not mordok nor are they ulven they are necromantic there is a lich here then said rory on mardrun you were right horus von horst examined the runes and compared them to the notes in his book not just any lich he muttered its him do you think he has already started raising an army asked rory from the mordok i mean based on these paintings i fear as much look at these they represent the alignment of the stars my old foe is performing a ritual here tonight is the last night where is the nearest human settlement from here we need to raise an army and we have only hours to do it there is a small frontier outpost not far from here horus we can reach it well before dark if we hurry it is garrisoned by militia from the order of arnath even better fighting the undead is their specialty how fortuitous  rhodi had just sat down with drifa to finally begin repairing armor damaged earlier in the day he had several orders to fill and had to get them done before nightfall he needed all the hands he could get so he even put ylsa to work dria northwind one of the only longfangs who had stayed back due to it being her guard shift took a few components back with her and started making simple repairs from her guard post rhodi had been working hard all day and his back was killing him he was beginning to grow a little annoyed with his brother raskolf it seemed had spent most of the day running about like a headless chicken trying to manage everything and pretend that he was in control at the same time however he also seemed to be way too nice to actually get anything done raskolf knew that the little totem statue theyd found should be destroyed but hed let those idiots from the colonies talk him out of it if only anjan were here that would get raskolfs head out of his arse rhodi winced in pain tried to pop his own spine and settled for cracking his neck it wasnt just the work and the travel his spine always acted up during any time of the year that was a season rhodi had suffered a horrific spinal injury back in his days as a warrior it happened in the same battle that cost anjan her sight they were all three of them rhodi raskolf and anjan members of the tundra wolves back then it was an elite war pack independent of any clan and made up from only the fiercest warriors of the ulven nation they specialized in fighting the mordok and traveled all of mardrun to wherever they were needed the tundra wolves were a special pack comprised of the greatest of ulven heroes and the sons and daughters of the most prominent leaders in the nation to serve in that pack was the greatest honor anyone of the warrior caste could ever hope to achieve raskolf and rhodi had trained hard to get in when the opportunity arose which was infrequent as the pack rarely recruited the two boys had even traveled to longfang territory to seek out the tutelage of the great ulven hero hanseth longfang there they studied day and night with the longfangs a pack which prided itself as producing the strongest warriors on all of mardrun and who often provided professional soldiers and bodyguards for the most important and highest ranking leaders and priestesses in the ulven nation the longfangs as a matter of fact were so strict with their warriors that any children who they deemed weak or sickly were sent to live with other packs many of the tundra wolves were born and raised in the longfang pack as far as tundra wolf selection went just being accepted past the initial trials by combat and the earliest phases of candidacy could earn a warrior renown even if they didnt make the cut raskolf and rhodi had made it to be honest though rhodi had always felt a little out of place in that warpack there was always just the slightest sliver of doubt as to whether he actually belonged there he remembered the day that he and raskolf made the cut there were some who said that the two had only been accepted because they were twins ulven women almost never give birth to twins it happens so infrequently that it is considered a powerful portent indeed should it happen and the children are believed to live a blessed existence and to be destined for greatness right thought rhodi gritting his teeth against blood blisters as he used his bare fingers to close a tear in a piece of chainmail charmed existence all right others still had said that the brothers only made it in because their mother was such a highranking warrior in the lunar camp of course if getting through candidacy had been hell then that didnt leave much room for metaphors to describe what being the new guys in that sort of a pack was like anjan was the meanest having been the newbie herself until the boys showed up if the boys didnt feel that theyd earned their place by going through selection they sure felt like it after a few months on the road with those savages the tundra wolves were big damn heroes and they knew it wherever they went people took care of them they could roll into any village on mardrun drink all the mead trash the tavern eat whatever they wanted sleep with whoever they wanted and never have to worry about the bill in return they fought with a ferocity and savagery that even the mordok found barbaric they traveled fast and light the tundra wolves lived off of the land and the generosity of the clans and packs they came across in time raskolf and rhodi found their places within the warpack rhodi specialized in heavy weapons like anjan raskolf learned tactics and strategy and gradually was given more and more responsibility as a leader within a few years he was one of the packleaders that was all history now it was a different time and though the land was the same it felt like a different world now with strange new people rhodi didnt live in the past he couldnt stand people who did he had no time for crusty out of shape men and women whod reached their prime years ago been in one battle or won one contest and just stopped there sad old characters who told the same story over and over in the tavern every night wondering why the heck they were still alive and if the great wolf would remember them when they died facedown in a puddle twenty years after the last thing they ever did no rhodi couldnt stand people like that rhodi lived every day to its fullest rhodi worked hard played harder and drank hardest rhodi didnt drink to forget anything though nor did he drink to remember either which is almost always counterproductive anyway rhodi drank to celebrate life if the great wolf somehow didnt know rhodis name it would only be because it was too loud to hear anything at rhodis parties just to be on the safe side rhodi made sure that any woman he bedded screamed his name loud enough for the great wolf to hear rhodi grinned to himself as he worked as much as his body protested there was something about being on the road again that felt good especially now that he wasnt a soldier anymore raskolf cursed to himself as he worked hang this ambassador garbage life was so much easier when he was a soldier raskolf was running back and forth between the front gate and the fat merchant rhodi wasnt sure if raskolf was storming or scurrying it was a rather unnatural combination of the two rhodi squinted in the evening light he was pretty sure he could see his brothers hair getting grayer with every step rhodi decided to take a break from his work and investigate a drinking break rhodi pulled a cork and sauntered over to the front gate he was caught a bit off guard by what he saw it was a hostage situation aradael and his men were arrayed in a line on their knees with their hands bound behind them and blades at their throats the men were battered and bloody some of them had arrows sticking out of them their captors wore green tabards with daggers for heraldry rhodi glanced over his shoulder at raskolf his brother was having a heated argument with the fat merchant over a small bag of silver coins whats going on rhodi asked one of the archers the ulven ambassador is trying to negotiate their ransom with that ulven pack out on patrol we dont have enough manpower to make a move without them killing the hostages first i dont think the fat merchant wants to pay it he thinks one of the adventurers stole his paychest oh said rhodi is that all ive got this rhodi sauntered up to the front gate with bottle in hand gentlemen he yelled you have the tired and hungry look of traveled soldiers i know that feeling my name is rhodi master brewer and winemaker of my clan but i used to carry a shield in my younger days who is your captain the men in green looked around among each other for a moment there were a few whispers and nods of agreement before one of them stepped forward he was tall lanky and had a red beard you must be captain then good sir yeah said the man sure well sir i need to be frank with you im afraid that we cannot pay your ransom these men you see are hired security they were paid in advance so any money you got off of their persons was what they were worth to us and really all we had that other guy said he was some sort of diplomat or noble or something he must have money raskolf no he has a rather overinflated self image hes here to help set up a trading post thats all trust me ive known him his whole life he was probably trying to scare you with all this talk about the eyes and the ears of the clan being on you and stuff wasnt he the man with the red beard shifted his weight and looked kind of disappointed look captain said rhodi let me level with you we dont have the money for the ransom but there are mordok in the area and wed really like these mercenaries back especially with the sun going down im sure you want to get your men safely back to your camp too for the same reason how about a trade you guys look thirsty and hungry and we are in the middle of nowhere how about i send you home with a party in a crate hmmm here taste this rhodi took a swallow from his bottle and handed it to the man the man hesitated for a second sniffed the bottle and then took a swig the corners of his mouth turned up as he lowered the bottle and his eyes sparkled rhodi knew hed won im the master brewer and winemaker for my clan rhodi beamed i have more where that came from as well as some cheese and sausage do we have ourselves a deal by the time raskolf convinced the fat merchant to pay up and had run back to the front gate the bandits were already leaving the gate guards were helping the wounded militia men of crows landing by performing first aid raskolf stared for a moment as the healer lady rushed past him followed by elise and drifa carrying baskets of bandages what just happened asked raskolf your brother just saved everyone with a crate of wine some sausage and a cheese wheel grunted aradael as drifa tended to his wounds raskolf stared at the small coin pouch he held in his hand he scratched his head brother laughed rhodi slapping him on the shoulder from behind youve been an officer too long i beg your pardon youve forgotten how to talk to soldiers youve forgotten what it is to be a soldier raskolf narrowed his eyes and cocked his head as aradael limped past leaning on one of his men all that fancy talk raskolf with the titles and everything you cant do that and expect them to respect you you sound like a bloody officer or maybe one of those damned nobles you spent all that time with in new hope soldiers hate those people talking like that instantly makes them hate you and think you are an idiot i certainly feel like an idiot he grumbled and i probably look like one now raskolf said rhodi im a blacksmith but i remember what it was like to be a soldier you do too tell me what does every soldier everywhere in every army want all the time raskolf sighed to go home rhodi they all want to go home thats right soldiers want to go home they are always hungry and they love to drink i appealed to that you have to look at things from the perspective of who you are talking to right it was quiet for a moment well said rhodi i have to get back to work the sun horse is almost descended rhodi turned he started walking back towards his temporary workshop rhodi said raskolf rhodi stopped but did not turn to face his brother yeah thank you brother said raskolf thank you i know that travel is hard on your back but i think it goes without saying just how much i need you someone has to keep you grounded lest your head swell anymore than it already has laughed rhodi as he crunched down the gravel path who better to anchor you than a blacksmith and his anvil  as the bandits returned to their camp the man with the red beard was quite proud of himself the provisions they acquired from that ulven brewer at the old keep were badly needed he only hoped that his little brothers raiding party would soon return from their hit on that caravan to the east with even more food it would be getting dark before long and there were mordok about the man with the red beard took a swig from the bottle as the ragtag encampment came into view the area was becoming too dangerous and too traveled soon the bandits would have to move whether mr black liked it or not mr black was not popular among the men he employed even the hearts of sellswords and neer do wells are not so hardened as to be unaffected by the trauma of killing travelers on the road for no reason and then being forced to bury them in a secret graveyard by letting those men live today the bandits had risked angering their mysterious employer but hunger desperation and weariness were taking their toll on the bandits tonight thought the man with the red beard we feast tomorrow we move on and leave these dark deeds behind us  bite patrolled the ramparts her diminutive stature made it a harder task for her than for her peers the archer wasnt even sure exactly what would happen if she had to shoot down from her position up on the wall she could barely see over the ramparts and it made it difficult for her to aim her field of fire was seriously restricted and she wouldnt really be able to shoot down at anyone who got too close to the wall she started organizing the rocks that the troops had hauled up on the walls into neat stacks and piles when no one was looking she tested their stability by climbing up onto them that was better now she had a much improved field of fire bites small size made her the brunt of many jokes she was quite possibly the littlest ulven on mardrun all the joking aside though she loved the people of crows landing they were her family ten years ago bite had been found by the crows guard as an orphaned child of perhaps five years she was alone in the wilderness bloodied and silent the apparent survivor of a mordok attack they took her in and the community raised her as their own she didnt talk for a long time and looking back she really couldnt remember much of anything of her life before her adoption from the beginning her heritage was questionable but despite the strained relations with the ulven back in the earliest days of the colonies the people of crows landing had been nothing but merciful and kind to her they hadnt been onehundred percent sure that she was ulven until her fangs came in during puberty but it had always been suspected by that point in time relations between crows landing and the closest ulven clan nightriver were improving bite was given the choice to live with her people if she so wished she had decided that the ones who raised her were her people and had joined the crows guard as a scout from atop her rock pile bite spied movement on the trail their garb was too practical for them to be syndar but not practical enough to be ulven humans one of them looked old perhaps they were pilgrims bite called down to the guards at the gate but there was no answer she realized that other archers on the wall were pointing at her little rock pile and laughing now that she had drawn attention to herself she hopped down and snarled in their general direction  who is at the back door shouted raskolf i put people at the back door where are they have these humans no discipline thats the second time that door has been left unattended the top of bites head appeared on the inside wall of the rampart im watching it from up here ambassador she said i dont know where the men you put on the door went though i think that is them over there in the courtyard a quick glance showed raskolf that the mercenaries hed put on the door were loitering near his brother and drinking he thought about going over there but remembered what rhodi had said about people not respecting him if he tried to hard to push his authority on them they werent his troops and he wasnt the one who paid them why should they listen to him anyway no discipline muttered raskolf very well bite you watch that door from up on the wall i know you at least have a good enough span of attention to stay put until relieved yes sir she said i wont move from this spot no matter what good work raskolf looked around most of the troops from crows landing were attending to the wounded or wounded themselves he was about to pull some of sir williams men off the front gate but realized that they were the ones keeping the mercenaries under supervision and hed probably never get those soldiers of fortune to stay put again if he moved their babysitters on the other side of the wall he heard an owl hoot despite the fact that the sun horse had yet to cross the west horizon never mind he thought to himself before returning the bird call in that case ill just get it  i dont know said rory there is no banner of the lion rampant on the keep no banner at all actually last time i was here i was challenged by guards before i made it this halt who goes there shouted a little voice a small face appeared between the ramparts thats no lion grumbled rory not even an eagle likely greetings shouted horus i am horus von horst but my best friends call me boomhowler this is my friend rory sturm the famous explorer and cartographer she looks like she is about fifteen grumbled rory squinting against the low lying sun over the wall the door opened and a lone ulven warrior dressed in leather armor stepped out my name is raskolf vakr he said ambassador of the silverhowl pack and voice of the watchwolves we need to see the garrison commander from the order of arnath said horus its important raskolf laughed and stepped away from the doorway thats rather bold of him he doesnt even know us whispered rory not really said raskolf my longfangs are back several figures rose silently from the foliage off to the sides of the trail i dont know anything about the order of arnath he continued but there is a fat merchant inside who thinks that he owns the place and probably feels the same way about the people raskolf approached the two men and clasped their forearms as he welcomed them inside your reputation precedes you horus von horst i have met your sons dont let that ruin his reputation for you grumbled rory dont mind rory said horus he is a navigator and explorer himself and he considers my sons to be competition the two travelers were escorted inside by raskolf and the longfangs raskolf sent the longfangs about to perform security tasks without so much as a break to get water or change their socks so said horus looking around at the overgrown and neglected keep we were looking for a garrison of soldiers of the order of arnaths fist but we found you here instead if this isnt an order outpost what is it that fat merchant can tell you better than i said raskolf i am just passing through we linked up with this merchant and his baggage train along the way and decided to travel together for the sake of numbers and safety i believe that his intent was to reestablish this fort as a trading post between the colonies the merchant and his hired security intend to stay here but my people will be moving on in the morning how many of there are you thats a rather suspicious question growled raskolf i ask because i need your help you have the honor of my name you said that you know my sons i have met your bastards which ones muttered rory if you must know i have met the crazy one the angry one the slow one and the one with the hat there is little time and the task is dangerous started horus wait was aedan the angry one or the slow one i said angry to differentiate him from the other slow one right horus von horst paused and thought for a moment just out of curiosity are you on good terms with my sons i fought along side them and they were generous and hospitable towards me and my daughter not too hospitable towards your daughter i hope horus cringed no she is a child of only seven summers oh thank the gods he said rory rolled his eyes and squinted at the setting sun boomhowler said a scratchy voice boomhowler is that really you the men turned to see who addressed them and found themselves face to face with the old man that drifa had helped earlier jack excalimed horus jack my old friend how are you oh boomhowler said the old man what a sight for weary eyes what brings you here who is your friend the joviality drained from horuss face jack my old friend said horus this is rory sturm the famous explorer you know him very well we have all adventured together the sad vacancy of the elderly briefly sparkled in the old mans eyes he said nothing to rory but smiled nervously horus grabbed jack by the shoulders so they were face to face i need to know something jack do you remember your arcane talents on this day what laughed jack what do you mean oh jack sighed boomhowler even on one of your bad days you remember me and yet you cannot remember all of yourself i couldnt ask for a more loyal friend but i really wish you remembered your magic today i need you magic muttered jack yes old friend said horus you are a wizard you are a great and powerful wizard in fact but sometimes you have trouble remembering things i need your help today do you need a guide asked jack i charge a very fair daily rate no jack said horus i need my old friend listen carefully and think hard our ancient foe is here i have hunted it and tracked it from across the ocean we have to face it tonight and the sun is almost down jack tilted his head and thought very hard the lich he suddenly exclaimed the lich yes yes shouted horus slapping jack on the shoulder wonderful this is wonderful how terrible moaned jack how terrible how could such a fate befall such a fair land have not our people endured enough excellent said horus you remember how horrible lamented the poor senile old wizard the strange outbursts had attracted a lot of attention at this point and the men were beginning to draw a crowd here jack said boomhowler thrusting his notebook into the wizards hands take a look at my notes as the sun set over the main gate boomhowler stepped upon a crate and addressed the assembled adventurers mercenaries guards and ulven warriors ladies and gentlemen syndar of all castes and children of the wolves my name is horus von horst some call me boomhowler i am here tonight because i have made a terrible discovery for a lifetime i hunted and pursued my most hated and ancient foe all across faedrun today here on this the new world your land of mardrun i believe that i have finally caught up with that ancient evil the lich is here the undead walk on mardrun the crowd burst into a flurry of commotion tonight he continued hefting his crossbow i intend to destroy the lich once and for all but i cannot do it alone we have reason to believe that the lich is working with the mordok in this region to conduct a ritual in the abandoned mine to the northeast this may be our only chance to destroy the beast before it becomes too powerful people began shouting over each other and asking a million questions at once calm in the flurry of panic and madness around them aradael turned to fortinbras the two exchanged knowing looks the lich will not gain a foothold not here not again shouted aradael over the noise of the crowd the crows guard will fight at your side von horst what do you need us to do the men of vandregon stand with you as well said sir william there will be an idol said jack looking down into horuss notebook the idol will be part of the lichs ritual it acts as storage vessel for dark energies in the old world these idols were charged by the worship and sacrifices of the penitent so that necromancers could build up and discharge greater amounts of black mana than their bodies could otherwise channel without disintegrating or exploding the lich cannot complete this ritual tonight without such an idol according to your sketches of the progression boomhowler the cosmic alignment will occur at midnight if the lich misses that window of opportunity then he will lose all the energy that he has put into the idol so all we need to do said the human rogue in the black cloak is keep the lich from getting the idol well the lich probably already has it said rory no he doesnt said the syndar priest with the golden skin we have it right the syndar priest cut off mid sentence as he gestured across the courtyard to the now empty pedestal near the firepit there was a sudden uproar of panic and activity as the inhabitants of the keep began making accusations of thievery and pointing fingers at each other duncan and raskolf exchanged nervous expressions at each other and moved to the side of the angry mob i dont suppose you still have it do you whispered raskolf nope rasped duncan through clenched teeth nuts raskolf was about to suggest that duncan take the longfangs and try to retrieve it before the sun horse descended and duncan was thinking the same thing except that his version of the plan involved blaming it on the hunchback both of their thoughts were interrupted by the booming voice of a young human dressed in blue and black horus von horst he said is this the idol of which you and your companions speak the man an adventurer named thanatos carefully unwrapped a bundle of rags and held the ugly little wicker and clay idol aloft it is i didnt think it wise to leave it out in the open he said gazing coldly in the direction of raskolf and duncan so i secured it duncan managed a sheepish grin back at thanatos but all raskolf could do was bare his fangs and try not to burst an aneurysm the sun was all but gone now and the inhabitants of the keep were barricading the doors in preparation for the long night ahead as the sun descended the defenders of the keep prepared themselves for whatever the night may bring be it mordok the undead or both as soldiers mercenaries and adventurers manned the walls the healers set up aid stations in the courtyard the provisioners cooked great pots of stew and began running hot bowls to the troops on the ramparts once the dinner had been served the pots were cleaned and water boiled for the healers dishes could wait the idol had been secured in a heavy duty trunk belonging to the fat merchant and guards assigned to protect it with their lives it was very shortly after darkness had enveloped the world that the first of the mordok scouts were spotted by the archers on the walls their numbers were impossible to guess their filthy leathers and furs gave them the perfect camouflage save your arrows shouted sir william to the archers on the walls do not shoot at shadows in the dark they are hoping to make you waste your shots the mordok seemed to melt back into the shadows after taunting the defenders for about fifteen minutes all was quiet the silence was nerve wracking not even a night bird or a cricket chirped the defenders looked to one another and then squinted once more in the darkness the wind picked up stanrick sniffed the air i can smell them out there he said to yawn the silence continued for a few long minutes or perhaps an hour the world seemed colder suddenly from the blackness came the slithering form of a great serpent upon the road no it was no serpent but a many legged creature like a centipede the length of fifteen horses it charged madly down the road and straight towards the front gate archers began releasing arrows into it though no order had been given and great rocks were hefted up onto the crenelations of the battlements as the form crashed into the front gate the defenders recognized it for what it truly was battering ram shouted aradael theyve got a battering ram release the rocks yelled fortinbras to the defenders on the gatehouse rocks and arrows found their marks and the mordok shrieked and screamed as they were pierced and crushed by the deadly rain for every mordok that fell though another ran up to take its place the ram found its mark against the gate and the barred doors flexed inwards before bouncing back it was holding for now but it wouldnt last forever ive never known mordok to use even the most rudimentary of siege weapons exclaimed sir william we need to reinforce those doors find something to shore them up and brace them with as the men of vandregon scrambled to find additional timber there came the sounds of screaming and clashing steel upon the ramparts mordok on the wall shouted a voice mordok on the ahhrrrgh the foot soldiers and adventurers in the courtyard immediately rushed to man the walls just as they joined combat on the walls however the bar on the front gate gave a loud crack and began to bulge brace it brace the gate shouted aradael the longfangs guarding the chest with the totem inside looked to raskolf hold the gate go he said the longfangs piled themselves against the gate the every impact of the ram shaking their bones and rattling their brains as if a tree had fallen on them grappling hooks came a shout from the walls they have grappling hooks cut the lines cut the lines raskolf looked around him and took the situation in he knew this place was too big to defend with this number of warriors the scenario was getting worse and worse suddenly hearing a noise behind him he looked toward the back gate in the chaos and confusion the defenders appeared to have all abandoned it to fight on the front wall even bite hed made her promise not to abandon her post no matter what though which meant bite he called drawing his sword and running towards the back gate bite as he entered the flickering torchlight of the inner rear gate he saw her shield lying on the ground below the wall bite he called again a faint whimper was his only answer aradael he cried bite is hurt the two warriors ran up the rampart and around the corner the young ulven girl lay motionless on the rampart in a pool of blood raskolf cursed to himself he would never forgive himself if hed gotten her killed as the two warriors ran to help her an armored mordok suddenly jumped down from a tower ladderwell placing himself between the warriors and the casualty and injuring raskolf with a sweep of his axe that carried with it all the force of his fall raskolf stumbled with the blow but aradael never lost his momentum though he wasnt able to bring his weapon to bear in time the big heavily armored human captain of crows landing charged his full body weight into the mordok before it had regained its balance on the rampart knocking it clear over the ledge where it landed with a thud and a sickening snap raskolf regained his footing and scooped up the unconscious little ulven more mordok came thundering down the rampart and aradael was forced to make a fighting retreat back along the narrow wall as raskolf carried the casualty on his back this all seems rather familiar said aradael clashing steel against mordok iron fighting a retreat from the mordok with a casualty in tow all we need is for william to join us yes said raskolf except that you easily weigh more than twice this little pup aradael roared in laughter and bellowed down to his men in the courtyard to take to the wall and help clear it as they reached the bottom of the ramp a healer was already running up to take bite from them as soon as she was out of their hands raskolf and aradael charged back up the ramp and into the fray unseen to everyone else on the walls a human in black was silently making his rounds of the ramparts and cutting the ropes to the grappling hooks down on the ground beneath the front gatehouse the doors suddenly disintegrated in a flurry of splinters and wood shards sending the longfangs tumbling across the ground as mordok began spilling in the last of the guards on the chest ran forward to hold the line at the front gateway the battle raged as mordok after mordok forced themselves into the choke point and tried to press the defenders back harlok raged and threw himself into the breach as though he were trying to plug a bursting dam but he was suddenly catapulted off his feet and sent rolling backwards by a bolt of dark energy there was an enemy spell caster out there magrat knocked an arrow and tried to spot it through the press of bodies all she could see was a tenebrous wisp moving in the darkness nearly invisible she loosed an arrow at it but her shot was intercepted by the body of a mordok as it clambered through the breach and into her line of sight she didnt have time for another shot the mordok were pushing the defenders back and she was forced to drop her bow to protect herself harlok lie motionless on the ground for a moment with a smoldering hole in the shoulder of his armor coming to his senses he suddenly sat up he could not feel his left arm and was forced to drop his shield gritting his teeth he forced himself to stand and then rejoined the fray elise watched from the shadows her father had told her to stay put when she tried to join the longfangs holding the front doors and said that he didnt want her getting trampled her eyes were upon the chest there was no one guarding it anymore suddenly elise felt very dizzy she knew the feeling well it happened to people if they were too close to her mother when really powerful magic was wrought elise steadied herself and focused there was something moving in the darkness no it was the darkness it was the darkness that moved a figure arose from that darkness elise had never before seen a god of death before but she was sure that she just had she wanted to draw her sword she wanted to scream for help she could not she couldnt do anything she couldnt even stop looking at it darkness boiled all about the creature and strange things peered out from the puddle of shadow as if monsters of the underworld were peeking up over the crust of the earth the lichs touch caused the padlock to crumble and rust before her very eyes and then suddenly they were gone elise snapped out of her stupor almost instantly and looked frantically about for an adult the only one she could find who wasnt fighting was the fat merchant who was cowering beneath his wagon with his backside sticking out elise couldnt find drifa anywhere or her father either so she ran to uncle rhodi and the longfangs and joined them in their melee at the gate minutes later a strange sounding horn echoed in the night just as quickly as it had begun the fight was over the mordok disappeared into the darkness of the woods william aradael and raskolf immediately began consolidating their forces and taking accountability while the healers began triaging the wounded as soon as it was discovered that the idol had been taken the various defenders of the keep immediately began pointing fingers at each other and bickering about whos fault it was before things got too out of hand though horus von horst stepped up onto the merchants cart and got everyones attention there is no time to fight amongst ourselves now it is nearing midnight if we are to disrupt the ritual we must go now rory and i can lead the way to the old mine we need men who are not wounded said rory speed is our greatest advantage over the undead and we cannot wait up for stragglers raskolf said sir william you stay here and help reorganize the defense of this keep in case the mordok return the men of vandregon and of crows landing have experience fighting the undead it is our expertise just as fighting the mordok is yours grab lanterns and torches said aradael lets move elise grabbed a lantern and hurried to join the war party oh no you dont shouted raskolf you arent going anywhere its too dangerous elise folded her arms and pouted as soon as raskolf was busy organizing the removal of bodies and the barricading of the empty gateway she ran off into the night hot on the heels of the adventurers sorry father she said to herself but it is personal now she had just caught up with the lich hunters when raskolf came running up behind her he was about to give her a good scolding when the party passed back the hand signal to be quiet were here whispered boomhowler ahead on the trail the intrepid adventurers could see the mouth of the mine an eerie purple glow was emanating from within von horst rory and jack huddled together to come up with a plan of attack and sent a whisper down the line for william and aradael to join them as aradael crept up to the front of the line he accidently kicked a person lying prone on the side of the trail sorry about that he whispered reaching into the darkness to pat them on the shoulder are you ok he got no answer and opened the shutter on his lantern just a little to check it was a corpse in a green tabard rolling it over he recognized it to be the very bandit that had held a knife to his throat earlier that day the redbearded bandits face was frozen and contorted in horror and agony dropping the body back into place he ran up to the front of the line weve got problems von horst he hissed what kind of problems sudden rustling sounds wheezes and moans broke the silent darkness as if in answer were staging in the middle of an ambush and we are already surrounded by corpses all around the formation and even within it the silent dead were awakening and slowly stumbling to get to their feet on your feet men shouted sir william the undead are upon us steel yourselves and get back to back with your comrades no yelled raskolf we are in the middle of an ambush its a trap just charge the mine get clear of the killing field raskolf what are you doing here just go cold things clutched at the adventurers through the darkness grabbing at ankles and stumbling after them but the lich hunters managed to fight their way towards the mine and away from the road they had moved just in time too for magical energies flashed in the night bombarding the place where they had been staging just seconds before stiffly moving mordok no longer living stumped out of the yawning purple mouth of the mine and met with the steel of the brave adventurers okay sir william said raskolf as he lunged to grab elise and keep her close now would be the time to do that defensive thing that you were talking about right he grunted cleaving a mordok zombie in half with his greatsword men formation white shield execute raskolf watched as the men of vandregon and crows landing formed up into a last stand sort of formation that would have been suicide against anyone but the slowly moving undead the few longfangs that had come along found places within the gaps at the head of the formation brave adventurers had accompanied rory jack and von horst into the mine entrance their fight wasnt going well rory had been dragged down by undead and pulled out of reach of his comrades his screams adding to the chaos of the lichs arcane chanting and the moans of the lesser undead jack was furiously hurling bolts of energy at the zombies that were trying to flank them while at the same time trying to throw some relief in rorys direction as the other adventurers tried to fight a path to the lich the beast recognized the danger of another spellcaster in its midst and stopped its incantation turning its attention to jack the lich drew dark and purple mana from the totem and began shaping a deathbolt horus von horst saw it even as it was happening and drew his crossbow it was loaded with a blessed crossbow bolt made from the silver of a melted holy symbol despite the chaos around him he took careful aim and released the arrow at just the right time to interrupt the spell to his horror the missile clattered harmlessly off of an invisible barrier around the lich and the spellcasters amplified deathbolt spell impacted poor old jack with such force that it blew him clear out of the mine and into the waiting horde of zombies fighting the soldiers outside amateur mistake von horst cursed himself back when i was on my game i never would have wasted my only holy crossbow bolt on the first shot unless i was sure that the enemy didnt have a shield spell activated outside the warriors found themselves nearly blinded by purple lightning as a body was violently hurled from the mouth of the mine the sudden flash of arcane light revealed just how bad their situation was they werent just surrounded there were more and more zombies filtering in out of the woods and from the swamp they arent drawing off to fight us shouted sir william they are trying to get into the mine move toward the entrance raskolf stanrick harlok see if you can get in there and help von horst horus von horst loaded another but nonmagical crossbow bolt very well he said taking aim i may not be able to destroy you this night but i can disrupt your ritual squeezing the trigger of his crossbow he sent a bolt flying right past the lichs head at first glance it would appear that he had missed but he had not his aim was true and the arrow shattered one of the three arcane mirrors that was channeling the dark mana into the runic receptors the lich shrieked in rage and sent von horst flying backwards into another adventurer with a push spell the two of them tumbled to the ground where they immediately found themselves grappling for their lives against undead mordok the receptors had almost absorbed enough mana even with only two mirrors the ritual could still be completed but the lich didnt dare draw any more mana from the idol now raskolf harlok stanrick and elise fought their way into the room just in time to see the lich throw von horst into another adventurer while raskolf and stanrick tried to pull the zombies off of the two lich hunters harlok tried his best to protect their backs and keep the undead creatures at bay with his spear he was fast discovering however that such tactics did nothing to discourage the hungry ghosts who unlike mordok feel no pain and therefore do not fear the bite of a blade the creatures were simply relentless in their press to close with the defenders he could not match skill with them for they had no skill themselves he couldnt intimidate them either for they knew no fear their horrendous appetites and unnatural resilience to physical violence reminded harlok of something out of his nightmares he stabbed them over and over and bashed them with his shield but all it did was slow them down no matter what he did they simply shrugged it off and kept on coming after him he couldnt kill them the mirrors grunted von horst destroy the mirrors stanrick didnt have to hear it twice his javelin hurtled through the air and destroyed the second mirror the lich shrieked and commanded more zombies to attack what it didnt count on though was the seven year old girl with a personal vendetta against it elise nimbly dodged out of her fathers grasp and that of the clutching hordes of zombies using her speed and her small size she easily evaded the clumsy enemies raising the last of the mirrors above her head she flashed a smug smile at the lich in a final act of desperation the beast darkened the room with tenebrous arcane power and tried to entrance the girl with fear as it had before elise was scared and the mirror felt as though it would freeze her hands to ice but in her chest burned the heart of a wolf and as the cold shadows clutched at her they were rebounded by the blessings placed upon her by her mother before she left home the lich knew that it had been defeated and in desperation grabbed the idol and disappeared with a bang and a flash of light the idol fell to the ground and the remaining zombies collapsed motionless elise stood there as though frozen her hair smoldering and standing on end as the purple glow of the mirror faded to darkness raskolf ran to her and hugged her close what happened asked stanrick the lich abandoned its ritual said von horst but before it did it purged all the mana from the idol and from these undead and channeled it to perform a long distance recall spell it could be anywhere on mardrun now we stopped it but we didnt destroy it pulling on a leather glove von horst took the mirror from elise you should never handle dark mana with your bare hands child you are lucky to be alive elises eyes were huge she blinked a few times and then sneezed purple smoke let us burn these bodies as quickly as possible said william send runners to fetch as much lamp oil as possible from that fat merchant the gold skinned syndar priest tended to elise this one should recover quickly he said gesturing to elise the fact that such arcane energy shorted into her might be indicative of a dormant talent for handling mana what do you mean asked raskolf when the lich recalled all the mana some of it was attracted to your daughter instead of the lich arcane energy can be something like lightning at times the fact that some energy flowed into her without harming her could mean that she has an aptitude for one of the types of magic we will cross that bridge when we get there in the meantime i want her to undergo a rite of purification from an ulven priestess thank you for your help this one was happy to help siala kay nu sialikaynu to you too said raskolf it was an honor to fight by your side harlok longfang slumped to the ground and stared blankly at the wall he had never fought anything like that before he never wanted to again  back at the keep horus von horst sat down he had never felt this old before though the night had been considered a victory he knew the end was not even close jack his oldest companion was dead rory sturm the explorer who had the best idea where to find the artifact was also dead it had been a horrible day for horus it could easily have been just as horrible for the entire continent if not for the unhesitating assistance of the brave group at the fort the more he thought about it the more he came to realize that so little was known about the the lich and the dangers faced he knew he had not destroyed the idol it was more likely that the lich and his army had left the area and whatever link was shared with the idol was severed he thought it would hearten the adventures if they thought it was destroyed some of the ulven had wanted to pitch it into the swamp there was a time when horus had once thought this way too but much to his dismay he knew that what is once lost can be found again horus and his allies had spent years chasing this monster with little success each encounter had left him with fewer friends it seemed as if mere men could not resist this threat but horus had endured and survived he wondered why he himself was not dead yet by all rights he should have died on faedrun but there was no time for this kind of thinking he would mourn the dead later there was too much at stake the undead could not be allowed to take root on mardrun perhaps out of this new group of adventurers there would be more willing to join the fight on top of that he now had an idea provided by rorys map of where the artifact was an expedition must be mounted into the outlands finding the maykar soul blade would let him end the lich for good and perhaps help to wash some of the blood off of his hands before any of this could happen he had to pay a visit to his old friend karl and leave the idol in good hands knocking the dust off his boots he stood up there was much to do he could grieve as he worked aeden haleth vonhorst hello friends i wish i was writing you under better circumstances but i do not have much time to write this so ill be brief members of pack greytide have attacked a village near starkhaven and slaughtered most of its people survivors reports are confused but apparently the greytide ordered the farmers to leave the open and unclaimed lands they had settled and were refused greytide then proceeded to kill all they could catch and any that fought for their homes women and children were included in the slaughtered greytide took trophies from the dead including the face of a young girls mother while the child watched the masters of my order have charged me with seeking out the leader of greytides masters clan grimward to find answers and decided whether we will march i dont need to tell you that if war breaks out it will spread we and i need your help to stop this before it starts i ask you if able to meet me near the grimward border in the ulven freetown of paviken in two weeks time between the 7th and 14th of eosturmonath i would not ask this of you unless the need was great i need the voices of ulven i trust at my side i doubt grimward will heed the word of a lone human i will be staying at the hanged mordok inn as long as i am able i hope to see you all soon sincerely aedan haleth von horst  raskolf vakr my name is aedan von horst member of the bastards we met briefly at the wayward in this past winter i wish we had been able to help more in the final confrontation with the mordok there but we needed to stop the other group of the beasts before they escaped i was glad to see that you not only slew the beasts but didnt lose a single member of your group the other letter in this message case was sent out around five hours ago to freya rev anda kargen bloodmoon and harlok longfang all ulven friends of mine and now you i understand that there is a vast difference between us the ultimatum you sent to new hope a few months ago aggravated an already tense balance between our peoples however i believe that sending it at all shows that you want peace between ulven and colonist i send these two letters to try and reach that goal if an accord cannot be reached with the grimward and greytide then we will continue to fortify our supply lines and help the local ulven clans we have allied with fortify their towns for now but we will prepare for war if greytide andor grimward launch an unprovoked attack our people or allies again we will respond in kind we dont want this if nothing else we have a common foe in the mordok but after having spent most of the last year traveling with your people i have come to greatly respect many of them our races have far more that draws us together then not im sure you have been told of our behavior khulgar graytide the messenger that came to the summit in new hope many of us treated him the way we did because we know him from an incident at the longfangs onsallas outpost this past fall he came in spewing insults at any and all present ulven and colonist alike especially an ulven named freya rev anda after a heated argument between the two that included history that i do not remember well as i was being treated by the healer at the time an honor duel was called between him and freya rev anda for many of us at the summit and all the bastards freya has been a friend for a long time one of the first ulven we came in contact with in our travels as a group the rules of the duel no weapons no death unless accident and the duel continues to one admits defeat when if became clear that freya was winning the fight he pulled a dagger freya not only refused aid but she still defeated the cur he then ran off with his toadies continuing to spew insults as i mentioned i did not hear the history between them but i found it telling that not one ulven that wasnt greytide in the outpost supported him at any time and members of at least three clans were present fenrir longfang and nightriver when khulgar graytide showed himself at the summit he gave no inclination that he was there in any official capacity stating he was there to observe us if it had been known he was there officially i believe his reception would have been icy but respectful of his position the greytide have shown in every encounter i have had with them a deceitful nature and a deepseated hatred for mankind and the syndar even when trying to help the longfangs of onsallas they hounded us at every step not quite attacking us but making our tasks far harder then they needed to be they also never raised a hand to help the longfangs themselves at least while i was present i do not expect you to trust a letter but if you are able to meet me in paviken or the clan grimward capitol to talk of these matters i would be grateful if you do choose to come i will be alone in a town or city of your people i believe we both want the peace our peoples forged in blood to stand we need to try and solve this situation before it escalates whether i see you soon or not thank you for your time aedan haleth von horstpack graytide father said the small golden haired ulven girl as she ran and clutched the pant leg of an ulven standing near the door to one of the packs long houses she was just about to turn 10 years old old enough to understand he was leaving but not old enough to understand why yes child said the girls father patiently as she clung to him for dear life i dont want you to go you cant leave again you always leave i wont let you the girl pleaded as tears welled up in her eyes and a sob began to build in her tiny little voice i am sorry child you know i have a duty to my pack and my clan i have to go because our clan and our people are in danger i need you to be strong for me i need you to be the brave little warrior i know you can be  said the father as he tried to control his own emotions it was always so hard leaving her every time he left it killed him inside it wasnt her fault that she didnt have a mother now it wasnt her fault that he had to ask his packmates to raise his child because he couldnt be around and now it will be even worse but i am scared father i am scared they will take you too like they did mother that you wont come back pleaded the child listen there is nothing i want more than to stay here with you but you know that i cant i will be back as soon as i can i promise the village will be safe keep to your studies and listen to the lore speaker that would make me happy knowing you are learning and playing and safe here in the village said the father as he firmly but gently pried his daughters death grip off of his leg he then kneeled down to her level and met her golden eyed and tear filled gaze promise you will bring me back a present said the girl in a pouty voice and furled brow she had admitted defeat that she could not make him stay but was determined to make the best of it of course i will bring you back something special laughed the father as he leaned in and hugged his daughter his only child and he allowed himself to take in this moment and he closed his eyes and smiled this is what he was fighting for this is what mattered to him they are a danger to her future to her life and he would do anything to protect her chieftain said a gruff voice from the doorway hesitant to interrupt the fathers smile immediately faded and his eyes snapped open he was still not used to the sound of his new title run along now child it is time to leave said khulgar graytide as he rose to his full height the emotion and caring gone from his blood red eyes chieftain khulgar graytide walked with a purpose through the thick doors of the clans great hall the massive long house was home to clan grimward one of the largest ulven clans in mardrun only clan nightriver rivaled them in size he passed by guards warriors and daughters of gaia from several different packs that had been summoned it was an important meeting and the packs needed to be there he had to steel himself for what was to come flanking him on either side were two large and armored ulven guards from pack graytide one was lycon graytide his tunic rolled up and pinned in the location where one of his arms should have been even with only one arm lycon was a fierce warrior gruesome trophies of fingers hair ears and teeth adorned their sword belts reminders of past battles and victories khulgar walked directly to the center of the great hall and stopped in front of a massive man taller and broader than any other ulven in the room and adorned with braided silver hair glistening mail plates of leather and a giant wolf pelt across his shoulders stood haygreth grimward clanleader of clan grimward the audience that was assembled quieted down as the final guest chieftan khulgar graytide had arrived khulgar was chosen to be the representative of clan grimward at a recent gathering in the outsiders colony a political dinner and everyone was eager to hear what he had to say i see pack graytide is in good hands chieftain said haygreth in a booming voice as they clasped forearms in greeting and i see the clan is stronger than ever replied khulgar you honor your brother vahdnar and your father now tell us khulgar of this little meeting with the outsiders said haygreth somberly wanting to cut to the chase it was pathetic the outsiders waste their time on fancy drinks and lavish garments when they should be worrying about the safety and future of their people their settlement is large much larger than most of ours but they are fractured from within it is obvious their leaders have greedy agendas and do not trust one another they have no strong leadership and they are weak even the other guests to this meeting were merely refugees from their previous homeland said khulgar as he half addressed his clan leader and half the audience gathered in the room numerous times did these guests mock me threaten me and even confront me physically disrespectful actions that would have led to blood had the time and place been different i grew tired and weary of the ridiculous nature of the meeting as it dragged on and on and demanded everyone present listen i delivered the watchwolf resolution signed by the hand of raskolf himself and backed by numerous packs inside the watchwolves and amongst other clans the watchwolves push for control of the outsiders and their disrespectful ways and the outsiders disregarded the spoken words of the resolution they were told what they must do and by the terms they must live by they would not listen they did not care the watchwolves made it very clear that they were to live by our rules and do things our way if they are to live with us in our homeland it was made clear to them what they must do or the watchwolves would take action against them and i made it clear that pack graytide would support them what of branthur nightriver was he not present at this meeting surely he would not stand for such disrespect to our people said haygreth carefully listening and taking in everything khulgar had to say yes he was present but he is not the branthur we all knew i am convinced they have deceived or tricked branthur because he backed the outsiders instead of us his brethren that or he has become much softer than we remember i called his ulven honor into question to rouse him out of whatever stupor he was under to make him see the error of his ways and that the ulven the children of gaia and of the great wolf are the rulers of our homelands and that these outsiders are a threat he too would not listen he blew me off and simply told me that the outsiders were allowed to do as they please on clan nightriver lands i could not believe such madness do we allow the mordok to live in our neighbors lands it was at this time that i could no longer stomach the place and went to leave but not before some outsiders confronted me yet again a tall one even laying hands on me in a threatening manner i reminded them of their place and that they were on ulven lands and should take more heed in what we have to say before they wear out their welcome then i left said khulgar as he paced around the front of the meeting placing careful thought into his words as he spoke maybe branthur is right maybe we should leave the colonists alone said a smaller voice from the back of the room the outsiders are vermin they should be put back on their boats and sent back to where they came from said another voice but some of the colonists have traded with us or even helped us with some trades and supplies said yet another voice they are a threat to our people we should kill them all and nightriver too if they defend them barked a large and grizzled veteran of yet another pack at that moment the entire great hall descended into a cacophony of voices filled with concern and opinion silence boomed haygreth loud enough to completely quiet the entire room no one dared speak again and anger the mountain of a man many have learned it best to listen when haygreth speaks i am clan leader and i will make the decision of what to do next this is a grave situation for our people and we cannot go into this blind khulgar is there anything else said haygreth as he settled back down after demanding the respect he deserved yes as i left the colony the outsiders at the gate were talking about a message that apparently a boat had arrived from their homeland if boats are arriving again it means that more outsiders are heading toward mardrun more outsiders are coming here to our homeland stated khulgar very carefully allowing the words to sink in we also received a message from pack fieldcrow they are not of our clan and they are isolated deep in ulven territory and away from the outsiders but they have reported to our clan hunters recently that another outsider settlement is being built near territory right now as we speak by their own eyes we have proof that the outsiders are pushing deeper into ulven lands our lands away from the borders given to them they disrespect us they disrespect our land they disrespect gaia and the great wolf ended khulgar as his final statement did its job and sent worried glances darting between those assembled this is troubling news chieftain khulgar graytide things are changing and clan grimward may be the only ones with the stomach to do what needs to be done but it is a burden we are willing to bear to help our people i will need to consult with the chieftains the high priestess and my warleader only then will i make the decision for the entire clan tell me khulgar what do think we should do asked haygreth very carefully as his mind considered numerous things khulgar took a deep breath and scanned the room everyone there was looking to him looking to the graytides for their experience in dealing with the outsiders so much was riding on this moment did he really know what to do but as his mind burned at the memory of his mate laying dead and bloodied in the snow at their hands her beautiful golden hair framing her dead face and of what future his precious little girl would grow up in he could not force the hand of haygreth he knew but he also knew that the clanleader would consider his words war i think we should go to war  over here now run yelled one of the men through the screams and the chaos people were fighting and running and dying courlina ran as fast as she could it all happened so fast they came out of the woods so quickly the men barely had enough time to take up arms courlina was still young she only just became an adult but she knew how bad the situation was she knew what was happening she knew how many of them would die she knew what these monsters were capable of and then she saw him her father courlina ran to him she ran as fast as she could for some reason she thought that if she reached him if she got to him that everything would be alright her father was struggling with one of the attackers clad in ragged furs and hides he gained the upper hand and stabbed the tip of his sword into his opponents chest the struggle began to wane as the attackers wound proved too much her father was winning suddenly a glistening metal spear burst out of her fathers chest clean and smooth and glistening with fresh blood another attacker had run their wicked spear through his back and out through his chest no screamed courlina as she stumbled and fell to the ground she knew there was nothing she could do now she wanted to give up to just lay down and accept her fate it was now that she noticed another body near the scattered rubble of a hay cart near her father and the attackers it was of her mother an axe had been buried deep into her gut but she still clutched the sword she had picked up to defend herself with she had died a warriors death moments later her fathers bloodied corpse collapsed down next to his slain wife her family came out here to start a new life to get away from the colony and the others to start again and now she was an orphan she could not find the will to live to fight or to run so she just accepted she was moments away from death she glanced over through tear soaked eyes and saw one of the monsters reach down and grab her mother by the neck a knife darted out and sawed through her soft flesh cutting clean her ear in a gory display of victory the attacker clad in blood soaked mail and leathers took his gruesome trophy witnessing her mothers corpse mutilated in such a way was too much for courlina and she blacked out captain wuldens men were en route to the new order fortress with supplies in tow when they saw the smoke miles out to the west they had heard that a number of families were going to settle in the area the smoke could have been anything but the captain had a bad feeling about it he trusted his instincts and sent a handful of men including himself to investigate they had arrived as fast as they could but they were far too late sir this one is still alive said one of his men as he knelt down to roll over the body of a young girl she jolted awake with a startled cry and flailed about knocking the man over she thrashed wildly crying out mumbled words including father and mother and all dead the captain reached down and gently took the sides of her face with his leather gauntleted fists he steadied her body and kept her from thrashing and forced her to look him straight in the eye you are safe child my name is captain daniel wulden eagle officer of the order and my men and i will protect you we have gathered some of your people and we will return you to them they are on the outskirts of this clearing child they are alive you are not alone anymore he said calmly and smoothly his voice easing her of her terror she stopped protesting and merely sobbed instead clutching to him for comfort the captain looked out across what used to be the village all the buildings were burned shells and a number of bodies lay on the ground the result of a brief and bloody battle they tried to defend themselves to fight back and they were slaughtered for it the attackers spared the women and children even some of the men that did not take up arms this was not the work of mordok those monsters would have slaughtered and eaten everyone corporal get me a messenger hawk send word to aedan in newhope tell him what has happened hereraskolf vakr ylsa stormherald dearest raskolf what in the name of gaias saggy tits did you do at that political dinner keep in mind that your brother and i live in a hut in the middle of godsforsaken nowhere yet even here we have heard rumors of a civil war caused by some sort of resolution that you apparently delivered and what happened to that idol did you gain any more information about it i tire of this voluntary exile and the ignorance it brings i had only just begun to learn the ways of this area when we settled in for winter and it appears momentous events have occurred in the past months that i have little to no knowledge of spring is here  we are coming out of hiding rhodis back be damned give elise a scratch behind the ears for me and give my regards to anjan may the great wolf hunt with you ylsa ps rhodi says hi and that if you suggest eating the rabbits he will turn your bones into a fine set of hilts  dear ylsa i have not been able to secure the idol but the portents have indicated that it is an unholy item and not some mere magical trinket according to my research and after consulting with a human sage we have reason to believe that it is directly connected to an evil power from the old world our priestesses believe that the idol should it fall into the wrong hands could release a plague of hungry ghosts upon mardrun the same as which destroyed the homelands of the colonists we have sent messengers to warn the people who hold the idol a group of humans called boomhowlers bastards but none of the runners returned reports from the eyes and ears of our allies within clan grimward confirmed our suspicions that the bastards had killed our messengers the graytides have encouraged us to join their cause but for now we have attempted to take a more diplomatic route and instead drafted a security resolution i can only hope that by going public we will force the bastards to surrender the idol the resolution outlines actions which must be taken in order to avoid what we believe could be the outbreak of an apocalyptic plague it also makes public the hostile actions which new aldoria has taken against the watchwolves i was unable to deliver the resolution myself as i was on a diplomatic mission in new aldoria at the time it was to be read but the graytides of clan grimward graciously delivered it for me apparently our resolution was not well received by the humans i am traveling to the reach now in search of the bastards and the idol unlike humans the children of the great black wolf do not run away from our problems we run towards them i have in my company warriors of the noblest longfang pack as well as representatives from the fenrir and other local families but i request the presence of you and rhodi as well your expertise in legends and lore may prove helpful on this quest and we may need rhodi to help us train an army if things fall apart sincerely raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolves  dear raskolf the hostility of new aldoria is worth some alarm to say the least and the treachery of boomhowlers bastards is truly saddening but it is wise that the watchwolves are seeking a diplomatic solution if the idol can truly bring the same undead that massacred faedrun then we must maintain peaceful relations with the colonists both syndar and human do not forget that they fought against this enemy for fifty years before they fled their homeland if or when it is released here we will need that experience on our side if we do not then we may as well blindfold ourselves before going into battle your request was barely necessary preparations must be made but rhodi and i shall soon depart for the reach we expect to arrive when the moon next begins to wane safe travels and clear skies ylsa stormherald  dear ylsa good news i was contacted today by a runner from our friends the longfangs the idol is safely in the hands of clan nightriver boomhowlers bastards actually agreed with our resolution and have not only complied but wish to aid us in policing the burial practices of their fellows reports to the contrary were false and i was elated to hear so after some careful thought however this same news also concerns me either our intelligence ring has failed us or we have been deliberately misled sadly i am inclined to believe the latter rather than the former i fear there is treachery afoot and therefore the matter still requires further investigation obviously there is also the matter of our missing messengers to look into the last ones to report seeing them were the garrison of a graytide outpost where they spent a night that seems like a good place to start our investigation sincerely raskolf vakr the voice of the watchwolvesmagrat farwalker harlok rill and magrat walked the steep path through the pineed trees magrat was anxious she had walked this road numerous times before but it was always while exploring helping on patrol or going to a secluded spot to watch the village life from a distance now her purpose was different magrat had made efforts to be a welcome guest by doing chores patching up scuffs and scrapes with her healing skills going on patrols and even training and hunting the longfangs had treated her well with the few vocal exceptions seeming to have been silenced quickly as it became obvious that veteran warriors and daughters of gaia tolerated her presence magrat missed the mountains of faedrun this was probably the closest she had felt to home since she left but it wasnt the same she wasnt ever sure she could feel truly at home but for now this was the best she could hope for though the longfangs had been kind to her and shared much of their culture with her there were times when she felt like a stray dog that had been taken in out of pity the syndar are a proud and longlived people and though she would never be so rude as to show any resentment on the outside accepting charity wasnt exactly in her blood perhaps that was why she worked so hard to contribute to the pack there was no going back her home was gone her people were almost certainly gone all she could do was burn the dead and march forward just like the ulven she laughed to herself when she realized that she had begun thinking like one the frenzy of activity after the humans dinner had everyone on edge there was little open talk of war but it was obvious that the longfangs were preparing for dark times magrat found it a bit odd that no outsiders were allowed inside the village yet the warriors included her in training and close group discussions around the campfires at night magrat almost let herself feel welcome harlok rill and magrat arrived at the entrance to the village the front gate was flanked by two heavily muscled warriors armored in a similar fashion to harlock magrat and her escorts waited patiently outside the gate as an older woman approached her confident stride and bearing marking her as one of the older daughters of gaia most likely one of the pack longfang witches we have not had an outsider step through these gates in many years said rill the importance of this invitation should not be taken lightly the priestess has requested to speak with you directly she will be surrounded by her daughters including me but i will only be allowed to watch and listen if you threaten her or she finds you a threat to us you will be killed no matter what she asks you do not lie she will know said rill as the witch finally reached them the priestess is ready said the witch harlok clasped magrats forearm in a sign of respect and nodded to her before turning on his heel and heading towards the tavern his gesture was probably meant to put magrat at ease but it made her nervous instead it was almost as if he had just said goodbye to her magrat followed rill and the witch trough the village center even though it was later in the day and the light was fleeting the townsfolk and even children were still out all eyes were upon magrat the three women approached a large building which was guarded by two fearsome  scar covered veterans the thickly muscled guards pulled open the massive wooden doors of the building as if they weighed nothing at all magrat tried not to look at the intimidating warriors and instead keep focused on what lie ahead but the intensity of their gazes chilled her to the bone magrat followed rill and the witch briskly through a corridor leaving tapestries fluttering in their wake until they came to a large room the room was big enough for a respectable number of people to sit and have council it smelled strongly of incense several daughters of gaia were seated in the chamber as they entered the room magrat recognized azra steelfang among the daughters clad in fur and armor as the three women entered the room became silent and the daughters rose to their feet as magrat continued into the center of the room she could feel their eyes upon her rill motioned for magrat to be seated upon the floor magrat took her seat behind her stanrick and yawn entered the back of the room having just been retrieved from the tavern by harlok magrat bowed her head respectfully before her was a built up area one that was more practical than lavish it was not a throne chair or a couch but more of a lounge with stacked pillows and small tables adorned with all sorts of totems items and herbs the linen canopy above it gave the impression that it was to provide some measure of privay yet also remain open so that all nearby can see and hear what is said when appropriate standing at either side of the canopy are two more guards just as fierce and as grizzled as the two guarding the doors at the center of the canopy sat a woman cross legged and adorned with fabrics both elegant and earthly the woman was very old yet far from frail in appearance she had vigilant eyebrows a strong jaw line and long waves of gray hair that flowed down from beneath a head dress of leather bone and metal like two small glowing moons with black centers her eyes shone with a spiritual light that cut through the dimness much the same as a predators eyes might glow when on the hunt magrat found herself entranced by that gaze as wisps of incense smoke circled the pair ulven are known for sizing up others with intense gazes but magrat had never experienced anything like this before it felt as though there was not a single secret in her world that this woman could not know just by looking into her with those intense unblinking eyes i am priestess soulveig longfang said the woman runeseer of pack longfang these are troubling times and the runes speak of many changes to come throughout my peoples history the longfangs have been the wardens of such change the runes call to me they show me things that are to be and what could be the future is uncertain and the outsiders have done much damage to the land of gaia and have threatened our ways clan grimward heralded by those of pack graytide push for action that could soak the land in both ulven and outsider blood clan nightriver stoically defends the outsiders and pushes for tolerance even as tensions rise and the watchwolves clan have called out for action and speak for those that follow them soon the other clans and packs of the ulven will be swayed in one direction or another and in the middle of this we have you outsiders from a far away land with customs and religions different than ours with tales of monsters and of dead that walk the great wolf listens to the deeds of the ulven yet his ears do not ring with your names the names of the outsiders the deeds in time are read through the runes yet my runes on you are cryptic this is perplexing so i demand council of you and those like you my warriors tell me that you respect us and have earned your keep here at the outpost my warriors tell me that you watch our customs yet have them of your own my warriors have told me that you can be trusted i demand proof says the priestess as she holds out a hand filled with small bone chips and shards carved with runes that seem to resonate with some sort of spiritual energy magrat farwalker fishbone tongue shaman and chosen of the ram hunter from the land of faedrun and the celestial mountains lorespeaker of the lost said the priestess as she cast the rune bones onto an ornate leather mat in front of her tell me why are you here magrat drew in a hissing breath the last time she had been addressed by her full title was similar to this she had stood before her peoples assembled elders and shamans and they had told her to go go south learn see hear listen all the answers she had carefully prepared the thought out responses to imagined questions fled her mind caught in the gaze of the priestess hundreds of reasons flit through her mind her people had sent her away she moved to find new information to see new places to learn of the world as very few of her people had seen it she fled the onslaught of the undead and moved with the men of vandregon she was put on a ship when she was sick and could hardly remember where she was and found herself trapped in an alien land surrounded by men and syndar she did not know and by this race that seemed to come straight out of her peoples legends and myths almost seventy years ago she said my people sent me away the dead walked our lands and our enemies lands our histories spoke of past times such as these but none carried the secret to defeating it i was to find out what was happening to the rest of the world i was to find how to stop the dead much much of my time away from home among the men and syndar of the south of faedrun is hazy my memories are broken and spotted i do not know what happened i was found ill and delirious they sent me to mardrun when the evacuation wasnt an emergency not yet but by the time i had recovered no one was returning i was trapped in an alien land i followed the course of the world then going where it seemed i should go doing what needed to be done i am here magrat hesitated words did not seem to be able to contain all of everything that had happened the fall of her entire world she breathed deeply she called on her totem and his presence settled around her and she asked for help to speak the emotions and thoughts in her heart with his guidance she said the only thing she knew to say i have no where else to go priestess soulveig listened to every word spoken by magrat never once did her gaze waiver or glance at anyone else in the room for the first time the priestess looked down at the runic bones before her to the untrained eye it simply looked like they had been scattered on the floor but the priestess saw more she read them she understood them and she felt the signs and portents of what they represented she brought a hand up to hover over the bones nothing happened for a few seconds but then one of the bones suddenly jumped and flipped to the other side the priestess considered this change and then brought her hand back for 10 years your people and the humans have lived alongside my people you are strangers to us your ways are different to us and your motives and ambitions are different than ours there are those among you that wish to start again in our lands and there are those among you that will do nothing short of starting a war for personal gains my warriors say that you have become known to us we know that there are outsiders who will if left unchecked bring ruin to our lands and our people my warriors say that you are not among them you have showed them who you are at least you have shown them what you want them to see but i know you magrat farwalker i know you as if you know yourself i know of your bonds your blood and your secrets you lorespeaker of the lost you traveled to find a path for your people but in doing so you yourself became lost you have made a great journey one that could have taken you anywhere and yet here you are  as she gathered the runes her other hand moved to a small table that contained a number of trinkets at this distance magrat couldnt make out what all the items were except for the one that the priestess picked up with her fingers it was a canine bleached white and large it did not look like an animal or mordok tooth the priestess placed this canine into her hand with the rest of the runic carved bone chips she hovered her closed fist over the leather mat and stared intently at her closed hand with her shining unblinking eyes then with a quick flick of the wrist she opened her hand and cast the runes onto the mat once again they seemed to naturally tumble into place but this time magrat noticed that one of the runes had come to rest on part of the large canine propped up oddly by the tooth in a river water flows gently in a single direction said the priestess it rolls and flows evenly gently rising when the sky brings rain or falling when the summer draughts set in but the water always keeps flowing always in the same direction if you know the river the land if you look where others cannot readily see then the direction the river is flowing is known to you you can see it know it and read it but no matter what you do you cannot stop the water now perhaps a bridge was built in this river by its original design and place it should fulfill its purpose and the flow of water should gently move around it but what if the water moved around the bridge awkwardly causing swirls of currents and shifting of dirt and sand downstream it could choke the fish and kill the wildlife now imagine that a large rock was placed into the river it could be placed close to the bridge diverting the water around it properly so that it continues to flow smoothly downstream correcting the path of the water and making the bridge and the river coexist in harmony or it could be placed out from the bridge diverting the water directly into it and chipping away at its rock eventually the bridge would crumble as the diverted water eroded it at its base the water removing the bridge and bringing the river back into harmony the priestess paused and gathered up a single chip of bone we she continued pack longfang are like that rock the priestess nodded to the older witch that had guided magrat into the chamber the woman rose walked up to the priestess and took the bone chip from her hand she turned walked directly towards magrat and came to a stop just a couple of feet away with her free hand the witch reached down to a sheath at her belt and drew a dagger even though magrats instincts screamed that she must focus on this immediate threat she remembered rills words that she would be killed if the priestess considered her a threat magrat looked deep inside herself to find the strength to focus on the shining predatory eyes of the priestess tell me magrat farwalker would you kill those of us gathered in this room if it meant that you could both return to and save the future of your people magrat considered the scenario laid before her the lives of every female male and child her family and friends her blood and kin for the lives of these relative strangers who for the most part barely tolerated her presence and treated her with indifference there were only a few she might dare call friend but she had no doubts as to where their true loyalties lay home the word rang bittersweet through her heart and for a moment anything seemed worth the price to be home again to never be alone again but she knew it could not be like that though they were not overly kind the longfangs had taken her in it would make her an oathbreaker of the worst kind she had to be honest with her self it had been seventy years since she had last seen her people who knew how the war had changed them and how it had changed her besides an irevverant but practical part of her mind reasoned there is no way i could take the guards let alone the entire room she quickly squashed the inner voice and gathered her wits i would kill anything and anyone i could that threatened the lives of my kin she flicked a glance at the witch and mine she added mildly but i see no thing here that could be a threat to them except my own actions it has been seventy years if my people have survived this long the deaths of ulven in their name could only shame us if they have not survived my presence will not change anything and your deaths would solve nothing it would be a hollow victory anyway and one that by the laws of my people i could not share in the priestess smiled at these words the first time she had made any hint of emotion at all honest answer magrat farwalker the truth of your words and the conviction of your reasoning behind them is genuine know that i would do the same kill anyone to protect my pack and my people sometimes the longfangs are sent to do hard things but it is necessary for our people sometimes the runes tell me of grave things things that must be dealt with for others to survive these hard choices are what make us strong we are the wardens of change to hesitate in our duties could bring doom to our people the priestess nodded to the witch in front of magrat the witch suddenly grasped her wrist and held her palm up when she brought the dagger towards magrats hand her instincts told her to snatch her hand away but the deliberate motion of the witch froze her in place the tip of the dagger bit into magrats green flesh deep enough to be very painful and draw blood but not deep enough to damage anything permanently blood boiled up from the wound and pooled in her palm and the witch carefully took the blank bone rune and placed it into the blood she spoke a quick prayer of magic and then removed the bone from your palm and walked back over to the priestess my warriors have brought to me dire news pertaining a pack that we have history with they tell me that relations with pack graytide have not gone well that they push for violence they tell me that their leader threatened others and could not be reasoned with but there is more to this than what is seen others do not wish to see the truth and therefore justify what they want tell me magrat farwalker said the priestess what do you believe of pack graytide and their intentions their views their actions magrat watched calmly as the blood welled up from the wound in her hand it was not the first time she had been bled ritually and it would certainly not be the last she licked the wound clean and quickly bandaged it watching the priestess closely yes it was not the first time her blood had been used in a ritual but it was the first she had ever seen ulven practicing blood magic this was new to her i have only briefly met a few of the graytide their new cheiftan khulgar being one of them said magrat khulgar does not seem pleasant but i cant really blame him my own people have had to deal with unwelcome guests on our lands the humans treated him with much disrespect and antagonized him they almost refused to listen to him when he delivered the missive from the watchwolves i admit to not being impressed by how he has comported himself so far and in my mind it reflects ill on those he commands i do not think the graytide are wrong but i dont know if what they are doing is right either i have seen war i have seen slaughter some of the memories i have left to me i do not want i know what an entire village dead looks like what it smells like magrat paused and clenched her injured hand until blood dribbled onto the floor i do not wish to see it again she said bitterly the priestess considered these words and smiled as before she consulted the runes casting them and then holding her hand out over them the priestess started to withdraw her hand stopped as if she had reconsidered something and put her hand out over the runes again this time nothing shifted or moved the runes were still the priestess returned her hand to the side of her crossed legs you think and comprehend more than most of the other outsiders you are wise magrat farwalker and you are correct most had not noticed khulgar graytides new rank amongst pack graytide he is now chieftan a sudden shift in power that not even i had seen khulgar is hotheaded as many of my people are but the real threat is that he has a voice and there are those among my people that are beginning to listen if enough listen there will be blood the runes hint of a time where ulven will take the life of ulven it is obvious you have seen enough slaughter in your time magrat farwalker i see it in you it is so strong so clear you are among the outsiders who bring wild tales of things my people do not understand things that by our ways cannot be but you do not need to tell me what you have been through for me to know it is true that i can see in your soul very clearly with gentle patience and grace the priestess arose from her cross legged position she stepped forward and down the steps of her canopy sitting area her eyes locked with magrats their breathtaking silver shining brightly in the dimmed light the situation in our land is grave there are things changing daily things that the runes cannot tell me pack longfang mobilizes for war in hopes to stop it the watchwolf clan declared dangerous words but they were words that needed to be spoken negotiations between my people and the outsiders must continue pack longfang will deploy to areas of mardrun and protect emissaries and diplomats you have ways that are different than ours but the runes tell me of a great darkness in the future one that cannot be stopped by us alone especially if my people are at war i would ask that you help us magrat farwalker help my warriors understand what it is we may face in the future help us prepare my pack prides itself on being the strongest ulven warrior clan of our people yet we are ill prepared for this kind of fight you bring with you knowledge both of a new enemy and of a new land in exchange you can find a place among us the priestess never moved or changed her expression but her tone changed ominously as she spoke but know this magrat farwalker we of pack longfang do not tolerate weakness you will train with the warriors you will earn your keep and you will serve with us if you are to be with us i will not allow my warriors to put such faith and trust in an outsider who has not earned it if you prove yourself to us we will help you in return you are not the only lost to have walked the lands of mardrun magrat farwalker and we can help you find out more perhaps one day you will walk the lands of faedrun with longfang warriors at your side but only if you so choose this path what is your answer magrats train of thought shuddered to a complete and abrupt halt her pride in being asked to help the longfang was swallowed by the shock of the priestesss offer a place among the longfang she could hardly dare believe that it meant what she thought it could but what about her tribe to join the longfang would that not mean abandoning her own people the lost she struggled with the thought she had not seen her home in seventy years and it pained her greatly her people were not meant to be alone but what was this she was not the only lost on mardrun someone was alive her heart sang with the words even as the bewildering thought of ulven walking her homelands sank in her mind reeled from all of these revelations and slowly deep within her hope began to grow she could find a place here and now and not need to abandon her people in fact they would go with her back home a feral grin flashed across magrats face she stood drawing her ritual knife and brought it to bear on her other uncut hand she took a moment to enjoy it it had been far far too long since she had spoken the hunters oath i swear over my blood by my ancestors and the spirits who watch that you shall never need watch your back because i will be there that you never need ask for help because i will give it emotion boiled within her as she made a fist and tasted the drop of blood that flowed from it normally hunters exchanged blood but she thought the spirits could make an exception this time for the ulven and should you fall i will carry you home myself your words are profound and genuine i know the significance of what you have spoken even if those around you do not this surprises even me you are either very trusting very clever or one of us is a terrible fool only time will truly tell said the priestess as she turned and walked back to her canopy she carefully picked up her runes and cast them again on the leather mat taking a moment to read them this time they did not jump or move once they were cast magrat farwalker shaman hunter and lorespeaker of the lost from this point forward you will be granted access to the pack longfang village you will continue earning your place here amongst my people you will train and grow stronger especially in the ways of the warrior you will teach us so that we may learn both of your homeland and of the unknown enemy you will help us break barriers to other outsiders who could become allies to pack longfang you will prove to us that you are strong or you will be cast out the following members of my pack harlok azra stanrick yawn and rill will watch over you prove yourself to them unanimously and you will become one of us the first outsider to be truly a full member of pack longfang know that this honor should not be taken lightly some warriors may not accept you right away prove yourself there was a quiet murmuring in the assembly you are all dismissed said the priestess save for my daughters at this the rest of the ulven gathered in the chamber began to file out except for the witches daughters and two mute guards near the priestess the witch who drew blood on magrat grabbed a towel and waited near the priestess after everyone had left the large chamber the large doors were closed and the room was quiet the priestess finally closed her eyes and blinked when she opened them again the shining light in her eyes was gone and replaced with a dull grayness she coughed a splatter of blood she reached up with one hand and caught the blood and cupped her mouth while her other shaking hand reached out and grabbed the towel from the witch she began bleeding from her nose the priestess hunched over suddenly as if her venerable age had finally caught up to her and started cleaning up the blood on her face the pack longfang daughters stood there silently rill inform the rest of the pack of my decision in this matter said the priestess her voice losing much of her stoic resolve it had just a moment before but priestess the syndar is an outsi started the witch standing next to the priestess do not make the mistake of questioning my authority or you will outlive your usefulness here snapped the priestess she let the words sink in for a few moments until she knew that the witch would not object further then the priestess looked down at the runes that she had just cast a few moments earlier rill is now in charge of magrats training and her status among us if she proves to be a threat kill her the runes speak of a conflict in her that does not alarm me at the moment even if i cannot yet discern it we the wardens of change warriors of the children of gaia and the great wolf stand upon the brink of a dark time blood will be spilt in the coming days and we must do what we can to stop it allies will turn on each other and new enemies will go unchecked unless we bear a terrible burden for our people if we dont the darkness will consume us all the mordok are no longer our only threat to the survival of our people now make preparations and gather warriors i want escorts dispatched to protect the watchwolf emissaries the colony must be contacted for allies prepare warriors to meet adventurers for an upcoming journey and bring me tea and put extra sap in it this time coughed the priestess into her blood soaked rag as she settled into her padded canopystanrick longfang yawn longfang magrat farwalker stanrick looked out at the line of watchtowers as the moon hung high in the cloudless sky although the night was still young the snow made the world as bright as day there was little to no movement in the night and the sound of a lone ocarina played filling the night smoke hung low from his pipe and no soul moved outside the out post it had been mouths since the humans had left for some other adventure and deep inside he wished that he could go with them and see the world that they spoke of he pulled the cloke in tight and took a long draw of his pipe any thing out there stanrick turn to greet yawn as he came up the watchtower no not even the wind he passed his pipe to yawn and went back to the view i found two more from the village dead in the pines today fell through the ice and froze to death stanrick just nodded havent seen you in the tavern in town lately dont tell me you have been here the whole time yawn passed the pipe back and stanrick took a draw rill didnt tell me to leave the words were low like the smoke coming out of his mouth still you at least come down to eat dont you stanrick shook his head no dont even leave when someone else is on watch but most like the company with things as quiet as the have been the two watch out across the snow covered field and the ocarina song was all they heard it was this way for quite some time till yawn spoke up again why but stanrick just looked out as the trees i mean why dont you go to town stanrick passed the pipe 3 months 3 months and not a single mordok attack have you seen any signs on your patrols yawn looked out dumbfounded it had been 3 mouths since the shaman had attacked with an army of mordok and now he had not drawn blood and for some reason the only one that knew was stanrick who the village thought went nuts after the events that had happened after all it was winter the attacks did slow up every year at this time and mostly every one else was worried about food but to not see the obvious was strange what if i get down and they come back stanrick smiled his teeth glistened in the moonlight the two laughed at the thought that if it was as simple as keeping one ulven in one place and the village never need fear again so thats not why youre up here why then stanrick took the pipe back and he took another long draw i have been thinking we owe the graytide a little pay back for what happened the village needs food and if you head that way there is a graytide camp 3 days away he had been thinking about this along time your crazy we would freeze or starve and if not there must be 30 or more of them and gia knows i would go just to see you rip them a new one but that would start a war and no one else would go with you what would rill do if she heard you were thinking about this stanrick went to the ladder lets find out  stanrick had jumped down the later landing on the frozen ground with a thud nearly scaring magrat to death the green syndar had took up residents in side the walls of the out post and did more then her fair share of work with out her tracking abilities it would be safe to say that many more would have starved she dropped the bowl of soup she had been bringing up to stanrick at the sight of his eyes in the moonlight the ground was harder then he recalled but his legs worked fine he made his way to the fire to warm his hands rill was not inside the walls but he expected her soon for she had went to the back of the out post to get more wood the ocarina had stopped and the young ulven got to his feet stanrick had a reputation as a lone wolf before he took yawn under his wing your down from there stanrick glared at the stupid question and seeing its your turn at guard duty you better get up there and no sleeping the young one ran up the ladder and took up his post stanrick warmed his body and watched the flames dance his mind had been troubled for dreams of walking dead that magrat had told stories of for a syndar he liked her and even tolerated her as he kept watch at night but the dreams bothered him magrat walked over to the fire i thought you were never coming down what is on your mind she handed him a drinking horn with mead he took a gulp and wiped his mouth graytides for too long they have been causing problems i think its time to remind them that you cant hurt some one under our protection so i plan to go to the nearest camp and remind of their place she had spent quite some time talking to the grumpy ulven and felt she knew a little about him so this did take her by surprise are you sure that really what you want to do some how she felt she could talk him down from this bull headed plan but he was not going to back down from this his mind was made up after the mordok attacked in mass and the other events of that day stanrick had been shoved from his post and the anger was more then he cared to put up with he garbed a number of weapons and took off down the trail with yawn on his trail the 2 ran half a day before they found a gray tide from the hunting party who was giving aid to the syndar that had shoved him to the ground this could have been the end of it and the 2 would have went home but the hunting party had been more then the 3 that had came to the outpost for the next 4 days the 2 long fangs chased graytieds back to there camp the 2 never talked about what happened out in the forest but when they returned stanrick had a helmet he didnt leave with want to come with im sure your skills would be put to use the fact that an ulven who for the most part wont trust other ulven let alone humans or syndar would even suggest this brought a strange pride to magrat no i cant i dont want to start a war stanrick shrugged oh its going on right now i just plan to strike them before they attack us in the spring with or with out rills permission the fire danced in his green eyes oh really  no you wont stanrick bowed his head and grumbled somehow the scolding had taken the fire out of his words and now he felt like a pup he knew this wouldnt fly it was not the ulven way you will not drop to their level if they want to turn back on honor then the great wolf will deal with them we are all children of gaia and that includes the graytide he glanced at the watchtower and wished he had stayed put i know that we a warriors and that i have to send many to fight and die but is your life worth so little that you would risk it for a cause that the great wolf would not hear your name somehow yawn and magrat had slinked away from the fire and took the pipes with them and what of yawn you know he would just fallow you not concerned of what happens he is still young and you should be showing him the path not teaching him bad habits this went on for quite some time and would have continued if it wasnt for the fire going low and rill remembering what she was doing before she put stanrick in his pace this gave him the chance to slink away knowing full well that if he went now that he may lose his pack and family to pride he went out the gate and plopped down in the snow much had happened and yet he was not part of it he longed to fight along side with harlok and kargon he stared at the moon as it started to set to the east the sky stated to burn red as the sun would soon rise he needed sleep and so he did his eyes closed and he drifted off to a land of dream as he lay in the snow it was dark and the grass was covered with dried blood stanrick looked out over the valley of fallen humans syndar and ulvens he turned to look behind him a large tent with the flap open had a table with a map a man in gold armor had been keeping council with others some faces he knew others he didnt there were banners flapping in the wind one man walked out he had heavy plate armor with a blue handprint thank you for keeping your end of the deal now if you excuse me i have some bees to attend to the man smiled and walked off stanrick turn to the valley of death the bodies stated to move coming his way he drew his sword and joined in a charge but all around was death soon he was standing on top of a pile of bodies but more kept coming he started to be over run be not afraid for i know your name he woke in a cold sweet but not in the snow he was by the fire it was dark again please stanrick think before you act i lost too many to the cold rill had covered him in a blanket her and magrat were sitting by the fire rill needed to give stanrick a propose in all the year she knew him he had been loyal and she feared that his acting up may have been her fault if he was acting up would others we need supplies i want you and yawn to see if you can hunt up food there is a village about 2 days away normally they send food but as of late they have not see if they can spare anything stanrick sat up this would most likely a better use of his time then what he wanted to do without mordok attacks and the graytide in winter camp he was just eating food that was not there and this would most likely get his mind off revenge yes my lady it would be an honor he still felt shame for the foolish acts of the last day then gaia watch you this put her worries to rest if he had been truly ready to disobey he would have strait out said that no honor was in this task but his head was back on strait and he knew that food was needed if the outpost would make it the rest of the winter  it only took about 15 minutes to walk up the road to the village that over looked the outpost and even though 3 ulven had just walked down the road just hours before the snow had blown over their tracks stanrick was nervous this was the first time he had returned to the village since the incident after running in to the garytieds 3 months ago the 2 ulven had spent 4 days nearly bathing in the blood of what ever got in their way they stunk of death and their tunics stained dark red the village was in shock when stanrick brought a sack full of mordok heads yawn had got off with just a week staying at the outpost stanrick spent that week in the stocks the others in the village started rumors that rill had favored him for one reason or an other after she let him out he went to the outpost and only left to run the watch line every other day once the snow fell he went up on the platform and stayed till 2 days ago on that platform he ate he slept and was the only place he talked to anyone but now he was stepping foot in to the village the moment of nervousness was gone 2 children were grappling in the village green but once they looked up they stopped and ran off in to a near house and hide clearly some one was using him as a what not to do to the children of the village yawn pointed to the mead hall lets get a pint before we go on our trip stanrick looked at the mead hall yeah we can do that the 2 walked into the mead hall only a few ulven were inside before the incident stanrick was held in high regard but now he lost honor with members of the pack namely the 3 sitting at the back table so if it aint the syndar lover make any green half breeds as of late this was the first time that norgoth had enough mead in him to say anything no stanrick sat down at the bar and began to drink his mead stanson did you think you could just walk in here im running village patrol and you can just run to rill to save you and with that the pint of mead was gone have a nice day norgoth i have real thing to do then fight a self proclaimed village parole stanrick went out the door and out to the village green you think you are so important but your not your nothing by now the whole village was out side seeing what the commotion was about duel me stanrick stopped in his tracks your drunk that would have no honor norgoth smashed his mug on the ground you have no honor mix breeder fight me one of the elders walked up to stanrick ready to over see the fight no norgoth jump at stanrick knife drawn but was tacked by 2 warriors and grappled to the ground enough shouted the elder take norgoth to the stocks and let him sit till he burns off the rage from all that mead the elder walked back to stanrick  son most others would have snapped after claims like you put up with that shows that you have much restraint true warriors only fight when they need too not because they want to i know were you are going and why no others offered to do what you 2 are going to do the great wolf will know your deeds gaia be with you with elders blessing and a belling from the village stanrick and yawn went off to the village of spruce grove  the two had been on the road for hours traveling into the night and now the sun had come back around they had been making good time and had already passed the half waypoint this was as good of a place as any to rest it was a high point on the road and over looked the surrounding area yawn opened his bag and pulled out a sack of tobacco only two pounds each that wont last 3 days stanrick looked over the horizon before lighting up his own pipe you smoke to much he laughed at the thought the two had been know to fight while smoking away at their pipes a skill that not many could handle so before we left the elder said something to you what was it stanrick turned to face the young ulven while we are out to find out what happened to our supplies we also are to keep an eye out for the bastards they have an idol that in the wrong hands may or may not be dangerous he knew it was but didnt want to get yawn concerned his younger companion had grown rather fond of the tall red gollum and if he knew that he might have to fight the bastards then who knows what he would do what if they dont want us to have it stanrick took a draw on the pipe we take it by force if we even see them yawn nodded a little well that would be a shame i dont hate them after all they did clean out a good chunk of swamp stanrick nodded lets get going i want to put another 3 hours behind us before we rest the two picked up there bags and went off twoards spruce grove another hour had passed and stanrick thought about everything the elder had told him he didnt tell every thing to yawn he left out the fact that the priestess was planning to invite magrat in to the village to hold council she would be the first nonulven to set foot in the village some of the ulven there had only heard about humans and syndar this was a great honor one that he felt she deserved the elder asked if stanrick trusted any other humans or syndar the bastards had come to mind but unless they willingly handed over the idol with out any force needed he could not vouch for them humans bothered him greatly after all a number of them had tried to over take the outpost and had been almost wiped off gaias green earth if not for some saving grace that they crawled out of the outpost and regrouped he had seen humans do foolish thing run into the pines at night with out a plan bring children out into the wilds yes it was hard to trust any of them and even after all the bastards had done the fact that they turn and ran from their homes why should they stand and fight for his as he was thinking about this he smelt it broken iron an odd smell that with out fire meant one thing to stanrick blood it was coming from down the road the two sprinted around the bend in the road and there was the source the snow was stained with blood and a number of bodies mostly ulven lay in the snow a few humans had been with them and what ever they had was taken so i believe this is why we have not received any supplies stanrick sniffed the air one is alive he went over to a man who lay face down in the snow he had a number of arrows in his back the two helped him sit up what happened human stanrick asked the man looked around i thought i was going to die here we were taking supplies to the onsallas outpost we thought that the outpost had been getting shipments but the last group that went had one survived who made it back to the village the bandits use a trail that takes 2 hours off the journey to the village they must have a camp on the trail i believe they must have at lest 20 of them hiding out that way he stated to cough up blood your longfangs right i heard about you i was hoping to see the outpost i hear stories of your pack and wanted to help out the pack that keeps back the mordok yawn looked at the prints in the snow leading off down a rough trail stanrick pulled out a small vial here take this and make peace with your gods this will ease your passing it had taken some time to get the bodies together and prepare them for the funeral rights but to leave the bodies would be insulting to their names one of the humans had a book with him he told the story of what lead to this blood bath how one man had ran away from the fight a week before some of the bodies where the ones from that party the book had names even deeds listed you understand all them markings asked yawn enough to know he was studying our ways i think he wrote all of this in hopes of finding the lost ulven and send them on to the great wolf he was a bout to light the pier when he heard the footsteps of someone coming from the direction of the out post someone is coming  stanrick was taking painstakingly care to prepare the bodies ever wound was rapped and every arrow removed in tacked so as not to leave the heads in the bodies the bodies where then wrapped the best he could with the rags that had been left behind he took a number of small stones and said a blessing over them then placed them on the harts on heads of the dead whats that for again asked the green syndar magrat had been fallowing the two since they left the village with out stanrick and yawn around she didnt feel right and although she had seen a few ulven funerals this was the most she had seen in one place 8 ulven and 3 humans 3 of the ulven were from the first group judging from the rot this will mark the heart and mind when we burn the bodies part of the sprit will stay with gaia so it will become the rocks and ash the rest goes on to the great wolf he placed the rock and yawn helped him put the bodies on the pile of wood the two had gathered will it burn hot enough that wood looks still green yawn laughed a little clearly you forget stanrick made this it will burn the last body was in place and stanrick pulled out a flint from his pouch and struck it the flame took and soon the whole pier was a blas they tended the fire and stanrick took tales from the book that he had found so the great wolf would know the deeds that the warrior had done magrat had pulled out her hookah and the 3 of them smoked and sang songs till the sun set then stanrick went to the pile of arrows 73 of them that he had removed and split them between him self his brother and the syndar now we will return them to they who theas belong the fire was high now and the smoke would be seen miles around stanrick hope this would cover them as they went down the side trail to the bandits camp hopefully they would think it was a wild fire and be concerned of their camp not not an attack the 3 moved swiftly in the night and the smoke covered the moon torch light cold bee seen in the distance and yelling could be heard 3 men ran past them hurry we will need to see how far the fire is from camp said one of the men as they ran past paying no heed to the 3 in the woods how could this start mordok they continued on their way the camp was small only a dozen men far less then stanrick expected and only a few keeping watch this raid would be quick stanrick knocked his bow and took aim fwap his arrow hit true fwap fwap and the watchmen fell yawn drew his mace and stanrick his sword the two went in to the camp and began to cut down the men that had been talking by the camp fire not a scream escaped their mouths arrows flew from magrats bow striking down the guards on the other side of the camp then almost as soon as it started it was over get supplies we camp here tonight yawn you have first watch the others will be back soon magrat was glad to see stanrick in a better mood then what she had been use to at the out post it took some time for him to open up now he treated her like she was one of them she sat by the fire listening to his story wait you fought yawns father when he was courting his mother he never told me that stanrick smiled why should he we share the same mother he is her last pup all but i have gone to meet the great wolf i was the oldest but mother grows old i can not let her youngest pass till he gets his fangs he checked the fish that was frying in the fire the bandits had food weapons furs wine and mead all taken from the supplies that were meant for the longfangs tonight they would eat well and rest before moving on to spruce grove yawn made a hoot telling stanrick that the others were returning its us mekihal the fire was just the ulven burning the dead get every one ready we might get them on the other side all was left was ash get the boss stanrick put up his hood as did magrat and they turned so the fire was to their back did you hear me lets go wait where is every one stanrick pulled his sword dead and soon you will join them  the three took turns keeping watch through the night and when the morning came they took all they could and burned the camp spruce grove was only a few hours away and they reached the village around 2 after talking to a number of people stanrick figured out that the bastards had been this way with kragon they gave him the idol and went off their own way this was a good sign and he would be glad to report once he got back home they spent little time in spruce grove just enough to tell the elders that the road was clear again then started back to onsallas outpost stanrick didnt talk much heading back and they only stopped to put a marker where they had held the funeral the snow was melting and soon the road opened to show the outpost in the valley below come they will be waiting for you stanrick said to magrat as they walk down the winding trailelise vakrravensmark raskolf vakr ylsa stormherald rhodi vakr i am grateful that you were able to receive our party your highness said raskolf on behalf of the watchwolf clan and all the independent packs represented by our resolution committee i wish to extend my gratitude to you for hosting this summit your hospitality warms my heart and i am ashamed that i misjudged your people based on a single unfortunate experience raskolf and the prince crunched down the gravel paths of the royal gardens at new aldoria rhodi trailed a few steps behind savoring a sweet yellow apple which was not native to mardrun not at all raskolf said the prince i admire what you said earlier about the ulven running towards their problems and never away from them as a leader i have never been one to sweep my problems under a rug i must admit that i too have suffered from certain prejudices against the unknown i am ashamed to admit that i was surprised when your party showed up on my doorstep with security resolutions and treaties in hand forgive me for my frankness but truth be told i wasnt even sure that your people had mastered the written word as far as first impressions go i must say that this visit has given me new hope i am elated that my kingdom and your clan were able to resolve this diplomatically you must understand that just as you had misconceptions about my people i had no shortage of misconceptions about your own i had for example heard rumors of a fierce matriarchal warriordominated heathen confederacy of shorttempered beastpeople who strike first and ask questions later quite ridiculous raskolfs thoughts drifted to priestess ravensmarks initial reaction to his report of the aldorian incident at the wayward inn he cleared his throat and flashed a nervous grin in the direction of the prince yes your highness ridiculous indeed you certainly ran at this problem head on but thankfully for all of us it was with pen and paper in hand rather than with swords yes your highness said raskolf say there ambassador said the prince i do believe it is time for a smoke would you and your brother care to join me in my library shortly i will supply the tobacco this time shall we say threequarters past the hour that should be sufficient time for you to change into your smoking clothes of course your highness replied raskolf splendid said the prince i should like to hear more of those fanciful tales of yours thats our religion muttered raskolf as the prince sauntered casually away from them down the path watch this brother said rhodi if i throw this apple core over my shoulder someone will run out and pick it up they wear special clothes for smoking raskolf grumbled lookit giggled rhodi here he comes hes going to use a handkerchief to pick it up too the prince has already seen me in both of my shirts what now they even pick up after the animals said rhodi maybe if i turn the feasting shirt inside out mumbled raskolf thats a stupid idea raskolf oh so you really were listening to me  just outside of the keep elise was perched upon a fence with the youngest aldorian prince she was wearing her favorite dress it was the fancy one that freya had given her at davons reach the one that she wasnt supposed to get dirty elise and the little prince had been playing all morning unlike their parents the children were spared of any paranoid misconceptions and in fact neither of them was familiar with the word racism let alone the concept they had been getting along splendidly since they met while their folks had been bowing and scraping and pretending not to be afraid of each other the kids had simply introduced themselves by first name it only took about two seconds for them to decide that they were friends and run off holding hands now elise was marveling at the little princes horse she had never seen anything like it horses were exceptionally rare in mardrun and the tiny brown scruffy shortlegged wild horses that she had seen in her homeland looked nothing like this animal the princes horse was twice as tall in the eyes of a child at least it had a sleek muscular coat of short black fur that shone like obsidian in the sun its mane was neatly braided and its tail immaculately brushed the horse had huge hooves with feathery black fetlocks he moved like a god elise was in love whats his name she stammered convinced that this little boy had captured the moonhorse himself like the watchwolf hero agnon had done in the sagas midnight replied the little prince midnight whispered elise i think midnight i think midnight might be the legendary moonhorse of luna thats stupid hes just a black horse its not stupid its true there is a magic horse that makes the moon rise every night thats stupid hes just a horse elise horses arent magic he is not just a horse he is a god he isnt so great i cant even ride him cause hes too crazy maybe you arent important enough muttered elise huh nothing she sighed nevermind well now weve seen him you want to play hide and seek again elise no she said staring into the animals eyes what oh come on lets go i let you see the horse whined the little prince no thank you whispered elise awww come on he pouted okfineyouhide she replied too quickly for proper punctuation great shouted the little prince as he ran off elise didnt try to find him for the next couple of hours he was quite proud of himself thinking that he had won  raskolf and rhodi exchanged clothing with a couple of longfang warriors who had attended as part of the security detail they werent fancy but at least they were different clothes and clean the two brothers were surprised to find that by smoking clothes the prince had apparently meant pajamas they met him in the library at the prescribed time and found him in his robe and slippers tell me ambassador said the prince what is the meaning of your title i am the voice of the watchwolves i speak for the clan under the authority of the high priestesses of both luna and sol wherever i go i am accompanied by the eyes and the ears so you are more than an emissary you actually speak with the authority of your clan said the prince you are no mere messenger you are actually important it is my burden to bear replied raskolf very interesting the prince said blowing out smoke rings that seemed to hang about his head for an unusually long time and how did you come to acquire such a position he asked i was assigned the title of the voice of the watchwolves by my high priestess anjan ravensmark to whom i am warder and mate i am her personal bodyguard i follow her by day and sleep with her at night she is mother to my daughter elise ah so you were selected by her how did you win such an honor was it trial by combat did you have to perform quests and do valiant deeds in her name to win her favor please tell me of your errantries raskolf glanced at his brother rhodi patted him on the shoulder and poured him a drink i was once the leader of an elite war pack called the tundra wolves raskolf said only the best warriors from all across the ulven nation were allowed membership we belonged to no one pack or clan we went where we were needed fighting the mordok was our life i see so you earned the favor of your lady through military service you are a war hero said the prince no replied raskolf i was an incompetent leader and i got the tundra wolves wiped out i entered into the service of anjan ravensmark because i ran out of money to pay my blood debts to the families of the tundra wolves she picked me to be her warder and gave me the responsibility of serving as her diplomat by personally representing her the prince choked on his pipe smoke and desperately gestured for rhodi to pour him a drink yeah said rhodi as he filled the princes goblet anjan hasnt been the same since her head injury my brother left that part out my good man coughed the prince that is not something i would share so openly with people you are supposed to impress you are representing your clan you said so yourself perhaps i gave you too much credit as a politician and a diplomat with all due respect your highness i disagree my people are all about honor ive just proven to you my sincerity and trustworthiness i keep no secrets a man without secrets is a man who cannot be blackmailed i said it before your highness the ulven do not run from their problems we run towards them sometimes even wise men have to learn things the hard way i like to believe that my priestess recognizes that fascinating i do believe that i am beginning to understand how you people think good but personally i find myself mystified by humanity so i cannot say the same the wine began to flow soon rhodi and the prince were engaged in a deeply philosophical conversation about the wisdom of making mistakes or turning mistakes into wisdom or something like that raskolf wasnt really listening let alone participating he was somewhere else entirely reliving his regrets it is said that the ulven burn their dead and never look back the ghosts of their past are not spoken to nor are they looked for this is mainly a religious taboo but it extends metaphorically into the way that they live their lives they run they run ahead and never look back raskolf knew better but he couldnt help himself in a way he thought running forward is kind of like running away from your past well brother said rhodi you wont put much distance between you if you carry it on your shoulders like that raskolf gritted his teeth as he realized hed said it aloud he nodded and put down his drink he must have had more than he realized if his tongue was that loose gentlemen slurred the prince speaking of running after things i would like to personally invite you to join me for a fox hunt tomorrow raskolf cringed  ylsa stormherald had been sparring with one of the longfangs when shed noticed the little prince leaving the clearing which held the aldorian keep she was annoyed that she wasnt allowed to smoke with the menfolk she was pretty certain that there were all kinds of interesting stories being told by the fireside human society baffled her why was she denied entry into the library simply because she had different plumbing than the guys what the heck were they doing in there anyway that they didnt allow females it had to be something embarrassing maybe they were flapping their plumbing around shed heard that politicians did that when they got together if that was the case then she was actually pretty glad that she wasnt a part of it after a couple hours of sparring with the longfangs the watchwolves and some aldorian soldiers she was starting to get bored but then a swordsman in fancy fluffy clothes showed up he was tall and lean with long dark hair tied back in a practical yet elegant fashion the tall dark stranger had a meticulous goatee framing his charmingly lopsided grin young lady he said bowing and removing his hat you have set my poor heart all out of rhythm for your grace is incomparable please i beg thee help me to get back into time by doing me the favor of this next dance the newcomer threw off his cloak with a theatrical flourish ylsa was delighted to see that he like her was a practitioner of the twoblade style well that was cheesy thought ylsa who found the gentlemans posture to be something reminiscent of a skinny weasel holding leather punching needles still this may at least prove interesting very well said she ill lead  your highness said rhodi mimicking his brother and slapping him on the back i am terribly sorry but unfortunately we must respectfully and politely decline your invitation we seem to have neglected to bring any hunting clothes ha that was slick brother all this talk about honesty and you cant bring yourself to just tell the prince that neither of us knows how to ride a horse well it will be terribly obvious tomorrow now wont it said raskolf i cant believe he summoned his tailor to measure us on the spot this is going to be embarrassing i cant believe these lunatics take horses into the forest that is like waving a steak in front of the mordok its a wonder they havent been attacked yet maybe i should have said that it was against our religion to hunt foxes mumbled raskolf its just one fox said rhodi that hardly seems fair that wouldnt have worked either said rhodi hed just hunt something else instead probably a boar id feel better about that at least you can eat a boar what in gaias name do you do with a dead fox  the little prince was feeling quite smug he had gotten his leggings wet but the bridge out by the creek was the perfect hiding place he wasnt sure how long hed been there or even how long elise had counted for but he was pretty sure that he had totally stumped her he hadnt seen or heard any sign of her after a while though he started to get bored it was his turn maybe he should go find elise so they could switch off and she could try hiding hed clearly won this round anyway and it was starting to get dark the sun hadnt set but the moon was visible he was just about to climb out from under the bridge when he heard footsteps the little prince froze it was elise the little prince silently backed into the shadow of the footbridge where are you she whimpered elise slid down the embankment of the creek she was just a few feet from the little prince but couldnt see him in the encroaching darkness i cant believe i lost him she sobbed to herself theyre gonna kill me elise kicked a pebble into the water under the bridge and cried elise said the little prince coming out of his hiding place its ok im right here im not lost oh said elise its you actually you arent the one i was looking for  the light was failing but students of the aldorian duelist had lit a ring of torches so that all could witness the clinic he was teaching ylsa had the best seat in the house so to speak she was exhausted but she couldnt stop now she was learning more from this sparring match than she had in months of study with her packmates things were happening too fast for ylsa to really see a lot of what she was doing but she could hear the fight quite well typically a swordfight with the ulven sounded like the slow clanging of a smithy this fight sounded more like the hectic scraping chopping and whisking of a busy kitchen no the duelist panted not like that you are overreaching here allow me to demonstrate what you just did did you see that a simple feint and i could have thrown you completely off balance watch me make the same mistake and see if you can capitalize on it excellent there you go brilliant now we lock up ahah oh but i am stronger than you remember what to do excellent you learn quickly but i can tell that you are getting tired ahah and here we go on one two and three step dip parry ylsa was so out of breath that she couldnt have asked him to stop even if shed wanted to a sizeable crowd had gathered but it was strangely quiet because everyone was straining to hear what the duelist had to say he wasnt shouting even though he was panting he was calmly talking to ylsa as if the conversation was personal he was quietly coaching her as they fought  what do you mean you werent looking for me shouted the little prince ive been sitting in a puddle under a bridge all evening waiting for you sorry said elise i actually forgot all about you i heard you though you were talking to yourself dont lie you were too looking for me no i wasnt elise shouted back picking up a stick and waving it menacingly oh yeah well then who were you looking for your stupid magical moon horse the little prince shouted grah shouted the painted face of the mordok scout as it lunged down over the edge of the bridge and grabbed at the children eep screamed the little prince eep screamed elise yipe yelped the mordok scout as elise reflexively jammed the stick into its eye before the little prince could comprehend what had just happened elise was dragging him through the forest by the hand and they were both running as fast as they could with the mordok scout pounding down the trail behind them the mordok was clad in primitive camouflage made from burlap scraps and he wore a fox skin hat he was armed with a spear and a crude boneknife he wasnt armored if only i had my sword thought elise we might have a chance her father had taught her how to hamstring a mordok it wouldnt kill the monster but it would sure keep it from chasing them as the children ran the forest became darker and darker until they couldnt see where they were going elise and the little prince ran straight off the edge of a ridge and tumbled to the bottom in a tangle of arms and legs elise blacked out for a second or at least she thought she did but she wasnt sure since it was so dark anyway they were out in the open now out of the trees suddenly her eyes adjusted and she saw the little prince lying in a muddy grassstained heap a few feet away elise didnt look any better and her good dress that freya gave her was filthy elise didnt have time to worry about that right now though she crawled over to the little prince and shook him awake as the children were just coming to their senses the mordok scout slid down the embankment and raised his spear over his head he came to a stop within arms reach of the stunned children bellowed a fearsome warcry and prepared to strike elise and the little prince screamed but their voices were drowned out by the angry whinny of a huge black stallion that suddenly reared upon the plain silhouetted by the moon the mordok scout froze horse is the mordoks favorite meat he looked to the horse he looked back to the children then he looked to the horse the handsomely muscled horse stamped the earth impatiently the mordok scout licked his chops and turned his back on the skinny little children visions of barbeque dancing in his primitive mind he drew back his spear and took aim at the delicious black horse just as his spear was at the point of release he felt a sudden stabbing pain in his thigh as the children scrambled past him hed been stuck with his own skinning knife the spear went wide of the horse the scout stumbled and placed a clawed hand over the wound in his thigh he regained his footing just in time to see the black horse lie down so that the children could climb upon its back the mordok scout howled in frustration and hobbled after his prey his rage allowing him to push through the pain and even break into a run cram shouted elise looking back over her shoulder that crummy knife didnt cut deep enough why is my horse running loose yelled the little prince elise elise didnt answer him but she smiled sheepishly in the moonlight and swallowed hard she knew she was in big trouble if they got out of this alive elise and the little prince held on for dear life but the horse was very careful not to lose them he knew where he was going he broke into a gentle canter and then slowed to a trot as he entered the firelight of the outer keeps earthworks  ylsa and the duelist were still locked in combat when the murmurs of confusion began rippling through their audience the two of them allowed themselves to be distracted just long enough to see that the people were parting to let a black horse carrying two children trot regally through the circle as if he owned the place the horse passed through and headed in the direction of the royal stables the circle was suddenly silent not even a cricket chirp ylsa was about to say something when the silence was suddenly broken grah screamed the crazed mordok scout as he leapt down into the circle from the top of the earthworks he was covered in blood and mud one of his eyes was swollen shut and he had a nasty laceration on the back of his thigh within seconds several fights had broken out between the duelists students soldiers and ulven warriors as to who was to get to kill him his last thoughts may have had something in common with those of a small mammal which has just been dropped alive into a nest of hungry eaglets  elise said raskolf what on earth happened to you what have you done to your dress your auntie freya gave that to you sorry father whimpered elise we were playing out in the forest and wait elise you left the keep where in gaias name is harlok i told him to watch you today um he said he couldnt he did said raskolf he said he couldnt stay said elise he and magrat were just here to drop off that message from the bastards but they had to leave wait raskolf said scratching his head is that what he said yes father oh i thought he said well never mind so whos been watching you kids today midnight whos midnight asked raskolf the moonhorse of luna raskolf raised an eyebrow go wash up elise i think you are in trouble stepping out into the hall raskolf spied the little princes nurse walking him down the hallway the boy was covered in grass stains mud and blood his dirty face was streaked from tears when he saw raskolf he averted his eyes the old nurse scowled as they passed in the hallway oh yeah muttered raskolf big troubleraskolf vakr elise vakrravensmark father said elise tugging at raskolfs cloak raskolf set his pen into the inkwell and turned himself around on the bench to face her what is it honey can i sit with you im cold of course raskolf turned back to his work and elise crawled up underneath his cloak and wiggled her way up onto the bench dear priestess ravensmark she read aloud looking at her fathers letter there are very few of us who can read and write said raskolf when i was your age i could do neither i bet you will be even better than me someday since youre learning so young the two sat in silence for a while save the scribbling of raskolfs pen and the occasional clink of the inkwell elise snuggled in closer and wrapped herself tightly in his cloak you know said raskolf your little feet are like ice if you would just wrap your feet like ive told you a hundred times you wouldnt be as cold i dont know why you insist on running around barefoot mother says that she is closer to nature when she goes barefoot your mother also curses my idiot ancestors as i dig thorns and slivers out of her feet with your uncle rhodis smithy tools mumbled raskolf our ancestors werent idiots giggled elise maybe they were said raskolf your mother knows them better than i do elise laughed and cuddled close to her father sticking her cold little feet into the top of his boot and wrapping them around his ankle as he returned to his scribbling she wiggled her head underneath his arm and stuck her face right in the way of his work so she could read it raskolf sighed and put his pen into the inkwell father asked elise why did you yell at harlok when he was fighting that mordok the mordok was trying to leave and harlok wouldnt let it an honor duel doesnt have to be to the death that mordok was very strong and was armed with a magic weapon it knew that it had beaten harlok harlok didnt want to admit defeat but the fight was over his shield and his weapon were broken so the mordok was going to let him go that doesnt make sense mordok dont do that it was an insult honey that mordok knocked harlok down and then turned its back to walk away it was like he was saying that harlok gave him a good fight but that he was done playing with him and was letting him go to fight again someday when he is stronger and a more worthy opponent elise shivered but the mordok are monsters she whimpered they arent like us no honey the mordok arent like us but they are smart many ulven warriors have died because they took that for granted raskolf sighed or because someone else did raskolf shuddered and clenched his teeth pulling elise closer as his mind briefly flashed to a different time and place the room was silent for a few seconds save the grinding of raskolfs teeth father said elise youre squashing my head and my ear is wet sorry honey he whispered running his hand through her hair and staring at something a thousand yards beyond the split log wall for a moment before releasing her the two relocated to a spot on the floor to be closer to the fire and elise unwrapped her fathers arm he had popped two stitches elise unrolled her little healers bag and set to work by the firelight so harlok was mad because he didnt win that fight asked elise he felt that he was dishonored he wasnt though the fact that he participated in an honor duel in the first place has earned him great honor there is a difference though between honor and glory even though he might not understand it yet while his getting knocked on his ass and disarmed certainly was an inglorious thing to behold he proved that he was willing to sacrifice himself to save the daughter of gaia and her packmates a wise warrior will recognize that and so does the great black wolf harlok longfang is an honorable warrior just like his father hes the kind of warrior you can trust with your life i dont know about you but id rather have someone like that in my pack than some hotheaded pup who assaults my ears with stories of all the duels hes won and the youngsters hes bullied and thinks he has to yell all the time or the great wolf wont hear him wolves have excellent hearing by the way honor is infinitely more important than glory though it may be less likely to get songs sung about you at feast time is that why you never talk about when you were a warleader asked elise raskolf didnt answer father asked elise im going to tell you something now that you must promise to always remember my mentor hanseth told me this when i was young but i didnt listen i learned the hard way instead and i got a lot of other people killed raskolf put two of the fingers from his good arm under his daughters chin and lifted her head from her stitching so that they were eye to eye their faces inches apart a warrior does not love the flashing sword for its sharpness nor the blackfletched arrow for its swiftness nor the glory of combat a true warrior does not love any of these things a true warrior loves only the ulven nation the clan the pack the family the warrior loves these things and what they stand for the ulven people themselves are the only thing worth dying for as he finished elise stared into his wet goldrimmed eyes and realized that he was shaking she had never seen her father like this and it frightened her raskolf released her and she immediately went back to her stitching so she wouldnt have to look at him aradael isnt ulven she said after a couple minutes of silence what does that have to do with anything asked raskolf you went back for him you almost died for him daddy elise pulled the stitches tight her tiny fingers the envy of the finest surgeon youve got a sharp tongue for a child of seven winters raskolf grumbled but youre right maybe the times are changing later as he finished drafting his letter to his wife the priestess raskolf thought about what hed told his daughter she was too young to have had that conversation but then again shed mortally wounded an aldorian soldier in melee earlier that day overall though she had a pretty short attention span and he figured shed probably forgotten everything hed said before she even went to bed he saw way too much of himself in her as the voice of the watchwolves scribbled away his daughter tossed and turned in her bed her dreams populated by cunning and intelligent adversaries much worse than the usual nightmare creatures from across the dreamscape a grey wolf watched her pup struggle against the mordok she did not intervene instead she lay down beneath a twisted scary looking tree and picked at a thorn between the pads of her paw it was in there pretty deep there is too much of her father in her thought the wolf id best allow this nightmare to play out if she is ever to learn anything i hope these two are worth the trouble william thinks to himself walking down a lonely street in new hope it had taken three weeks to track down his grandfathers old army contacts and arrange this meeting its just after dusk and the last few rays of sun light are still peeking over the horizon the street lanterns cast a dim glow barely lighting the path way william had walked this and many of the other streets in new hope many times in the last month trying to drum up support for the vandergon army he had gotten a few nobles to pledge financial support but had only managed to recruit less then a hand full of soldiers his hopes were these two men could help him remedy that  vincent and stan  william said out loud the names were familiar to him vincent monroe was a ranked officer in the vandergon army back on faedurn he found his way to new hope when he was given the duty of escorting a group of nobles and their families to the new colony vincent was a competent officer and well liked by his men at least thats what williams grandfather had told him stanrick varen had served with williams grandfather in the war he was a fearsome warrior and believed in the ideals that the colors of vandergon stood for stan had arrived in new hope on one of the last boats from faedrun he had seen the fall of the lines himself and barely survived he now works as a weapon smith and has supplied many of the guards with arms william toke a moment to glance down the nearly deserted street only a few wanderers and passers by inhabit the street but more importantly  where are all the guards  william thought to him self william had noticed this problem all over new hope there where guards around the outskirts of the city and at the front gate but very few patrolling the streets thats something ill defiantly have to fix william stops in front of a weathered wooden building much like most of the buildings in new hope the tilted barrel this was the place vincent had said to meet as william walked inside he scans over the crowd the tavern wasnt overly crowded and most of the people were too busy enjoying their drinks or engaged in their own conversations to even bother to notice him walk in although being one of the only people in new hope to wear the vandergon colors does make one stand out a bit there were a number of tables in the center and along the back wall of the tavern and the bar ran along the left side a small band was playing an up beat melody on the stage to the right ah theres the guards william said to him self in disgust two guards men were sitting at the far end of the bar mugs of ale in there hands william an older gentleman seating at a table towards the back wall motioned william over as he approached the man william recognized him as vincent the two had met before when william had first started to rebuild the vandergon army seated across from vincent was a dark haired man drinking a mug of ale william its good to see you vincent said in a joyful tone vincent glad to see you well thank you for meeting with me william said as the two men welcomed each other with a hand shake stanrick this is the fellow ive been telling you about the dark haired man then stood stanrick good to meet you william extended his hand along with the greeting the man simply said stan in a gruff voice and grasped williams hand firmly as if he was testing williams strength sit sit we have much to discuss barmaid another round of ale vincent shouted across the tavern as he took a seat next to stan and william sat a crossed from the two men so vincent tells me you want to build yourself an army huh stan asked in the same gruff tone not exactly  william explained i want to rebuild the vandergon army and it wont be my army it will be the peoples army why stan asked rather abruptly almost cutting william off because vandergon used to mean something back in faedrun the glory of vandergon was well known and the people knew what vandergon stood for the glory of vandergon died in feadrun along with its army stan said in an even gruffer tone no your wrong william protested  ive seen it here in the hearts of those that for no reason but to protect that with they hold dear take up arms and stand firm in the face of the coming horde the glory of vandergon still lives its just scattered divided  it just needs someone to gather and strengthen it what do you know of the glory of vandergon stan shouts across the table  i was there kid i was there when the lines began to break i saw my friends slaughtered by the lines of the unyielding undead and have the memories and the scars to remember it by what have you done to make you think youre worthy to wear those colors william locked sight with stan fire glowing behind his eyes never before has someone questioned him never before has william had to defend his deeds but now without breaking his gaze with stan william defends himself what have i done ive been out there defending these lands from those that would destroy that which weve rebuilt ive stood firm in the face of a mordock horde over thirty strong ive hunted a mordock shaman to the very heart of the dirg swamp and i was in the battle when that same shaman and his army were defeated to save a ulven village i put my life on the line to save the families of aldorin refuges from a rouge army threatening to make examples of them ive fought along side human ulven and syndar alike and i have worn these colors proudly i have memories and scars too stanrick and what of you my grandfather told me stories of how great a warrior you used to be and now you question my worthiness i have fought to protect the values the vandergon army was founded on i have earned to wear these colors more then you will ever know and ten times over an unnerving silence falls over the three men as william and stan continued to stare each other down just then a young lady came over to the table with three mugs after she had set them down and left stan quietly grabbed his mug and toke a long drink vincent toke this chance to change the subject william it sounds like you have noble intentions but how do you plan to make this happen well i already have a couple of nobles that have pledged financial and political support to the cause but as far as recruiting solders go im having trouble coming up with the numbers needed how many do you have stan asked breaking his silence his tone changed five with possibly one or two more good men and women even recruited a few ulven ulven in the vandergon army who would have thought vincent said questionably  of course remember this isnt about building a human army this is about building a front line between the people and the enemies out there look around gentlemen its a dangerous place out side the city bandits and thieves plague the roads and the mordock are a constant threat if we are to survive and prosper then there must be some line of defense for the people of this land all of the people as william explained this to stan and vincent he couldnt help notice three men enter the tavern he easily recognized their green and blue tabards aldorians william says out loud the three men watched the aldorians walked up to the bar and seemed to order some drinks they must be with a trade convoy theres been a lot of them heading in from aldoria lately vincent answered the question william didnt have time to ask stan then turned back and asked  so william i dont suppose you have made any strong allies with these human ulven and synder that you have fought along side have you his gruff tone now softened i dont suppose youve heard of a group called the bastards i have theyre an adventuring group and traders vincent answered theyre good people a little strange but good people william says with a grin ive fought along side them many times and i believe them to be honorable but what if they were asked to fight do you think they would join the cause vincent asks william answers theres a gentleman in their group by the name of aedan vonhorest hes a member of a militant religious order known as arnaths fist now them ive heard of stan says after another drink from his mug a couple of months ago i had some men come through my shop say they were from that order they ordered some specialty weapons and some armor aedan and i have pledged support to each others cause and if push came to shove i believe i could count on him the rest of the bastards im not too sure of william added what of the ulvan any allies among them vincent asked ive fought along side many ulvan and formed some strong ties with a few packs clan nightriver has always been on the side of the colonist and i have strong ties with pack longfang as william continued to talk with stan and vincent his gaze is continuly being drawn to the three aldorians at the bar there was something familiar about one of them something recent in a spark of memory it all comes back to him his short black hair his dark features and that crooked smile even in the heat of battle he was one of the aldorians william had fought against out side of the wayward inn the man was talking with the young barmaid from before their conversation seem innocent enough from where william was sitting until the man tried to reach up and touch the girls hair she quickly slapped his hand away and turned to leave the man then grabbed her by the arm and wouldnt let go ill be right back william said to stan and vincent getting up from the table and stared walking toward the bar if no ones going to step in i will william says to him self as he approaches the group the barmaids back is to william while the man grabbing her arm was standing at the bar facing her the two other aldorians are sitting enjoying their drinks ignoring what is going on right beside them let the young lady go about her work william says in a strong voice this doesnt pertain to you stranger the man says getting a good look at william i dont think you want to start a fight here aldorian william says in a threatening voice the man starts to speak then stops himself you william can see in the mans eyes that hes been recognized let the girl go william says again and the two men stare each other down then with one quick movement the man throws the barmaid to the ground and with his left hand pulls a dagger from his belt lets see what youve got vandergon and with that lunges at william blade in hand william side steps to his left dodging the thrust and grabs the mans arm with both hands he then slams the arm into the bar disarming the man the aldorian takes a step back grabbing his arm in pain and uttering some curses under his breath he then steps forward with fist up and attacks william dodges the first swing and blocks a second but the man is too quick and catches william with a right hook to the ribs and a left jab to the face william takes a step back shakes his head and advances with is own assault the aldorian is skilled and blocks williams first right left combo the man tries a quick jab but william quickly dodges and lands a solid punch to the gut this stuns the aldorian and william takes the advantage to connect with a solid right to the face followed by a strong left hook the force of the blow is enough to spin the man who collapses on the bar had enough  william asks in a mocking tone the aldorian then quickly grabbed a near by bottle off the bar and swings it at williams head william raised his right arm to block the attack smashing the bottle on his armored forearm he was lucky he had worn his bracers but the spray from the liquid that was still in the bottle had blinded william and the aldorian toke full advantage of the distraction william feels incredible pain in is stomach as the man lands his first blow william can only watch as his opponent strikes with a left hook to his ribs followed by a right to the jaw as william stubbles back a step his vision blurred time seems to slow down william sees the attack coming and tries to defend himself but his body wont respond the aldorian hits him in the jaw with a devastating left hook that sends william back another few steps as william tries to recover he can hear the aldorian taunting him is that all youve got vandergon i expected more williams vision slowly comes back to him and as he looks back at the man he feels his strength coming back to him with his fist clenched he stands tall and motions the aldorian over come on im not done yet william says with determination in his voice as the two men stepped toward each other william was the first to attack with a quick right jab catching the aldorian in the jaw william followed with a left hook and another jab both were dodged the aldorian counterattacked with a right hook then a left cross william blocked the right but caught the left with his right arm with this opening william attacks with a series of body shots staggering the man william then charges forward and with a strong upper cut strikes the men in the stomach the aldorian doubles over slightly at which point william grabs the man by the back of the neck and slams his head down on the bar the adorian slumps to the floor blood flowing from his nose and a nasty gash above his right eye william then looks at the other two aldorians still sitting at the bar i suggest you pick up your friend and leave william fully expects the men to charge him but they just quietly pick up their other member and walk out of the bar william then walks over to the barmaid still on the floor she has a look of shock on her face are you all right he asks holding out his hand the young lady simply nods and takes his hand as william helps her up she manages to say thank you through shaky lips your welcome miss is all william says as he turns and walks back down the bar towards his table as william passes by the two guards at the end of the bar he kicked one of their stools and says in a stern tone thanks for the help fellas  well that was impressive vincent says as william makes it back to the table he simply flashes a smile and takes his seat at the table as the pain from the confrontation sets in william holds his side thats going to be sore tomorrow he thinks to himself as he finishes the last of his ale with a few big gulps as soon as he sets his empty mug down a new one is set before him this round is on me gentlemen says the young barmaid william just saved thats very kind of you miss vincent says handing a mug off to stan and taking his own its the least i can do the barmaid say with a smile she then turn towards william and asks if its not too much trouble may i know the name of my rescuer only if i may know yours william says with a grin isabel the young barmaid says her chicks turning a slight shade of red i am william thank you again william isabel says and if there is anything else i can do for you gentlemen please let me know oh i believe we will vincent answered the three men watched as isabel walked away and could almost make out a slight spring in her step stan and vincent turn to look at william who quietly takes a drink a small grin peeking from behind his mug so william you said before you were having trouble finding soldiers where do vincent and i come in  stan asks changing the subject you two have connections in this town connections i dont have ive been out of new hope for most of the winter and the time i am back is usually brief in fact in just a few days ill be following a trade convoy north to help reestablish old trade routes i dont have the presence in this town that i need to get the word out so what do you need from us stan asks i need people i can trust people like my self that want to see the vandergon colors rise again my grandfather once told me that if anyone could help him rebuild the glory of vandergon it was you two stan and vincent glance toward each other with thoughtful faces stanrick ive heard stories of you from my grandfather you used to be a great vandergon soldier and believed in what the colors stood for vincent you have your finger on the pulse of this city you know what gossip and rumors are true and whats no more then stories your right kid ive seen the glory of vandergon with my own eyes unfortunately that glory died on the shores of faedrun when people arrived here they were broken and beaten with little possessions with them but hope for a new life what they found was no less threatening then what they faced back on mardrun there is strength here thats for sure but it needs something to believe in someone to stand behind stain pauses for a second and looks deep into williams eyes i look into your eyes and see the same fire and determination i once had thank you for proving an old soldier wrong im sorry i doubted you william anything you need id be glad to help and with that stan extended an

grandfather your dream will come true as promised as william continues on his way he is filled with a sense of hope for what tomorrow might bring things are starting to look up unfortunately that feeling is not meant to lastyear 260 solar camp watchwolf clan on the eastern shores of mardrun raskolf pushed away from anjan beneath the furs and blankets she was burning up with a fever so hot that her flesh was uncomfortable to touch her fitful movements and whimperings meant that she was either having a bad dream or experiencing a vision raskolf wanted to hug her close stroke her hair and whisper in her ear to rescue her from her nightmare but he restrained himself on the off chance that she was having a legitimate vision of the goddess or being visited by spirits pulling her out of a vision would do more than simply anger her it could result in a misinterpretation of spiritual advice and lead to catastrophe all he could do was wait as her warder and even more so as her husband he wanted to wake her but instead he watched and prepared to roll her over should she have a seizure when the vision ended raskolf watched it was his duty as well as his name which translated from northwestern ulven to the common trade language as wolf of spirited vigilance eventually anjans fit resolved itself and she peacefully returned to deep slumber raskolf breathed a sigh of relief and pulled her close she hadnt awakened so it was probably just a dream usually if she had a vision she woke up screaming or babbling in tongues or went into a trance and started writing things in the dirt or something once shed crawled around on all fours for twenty minutes and talked to the dog in what appeared to be its native language for now though her fever had broken and she was covered in sweat running her hair through his fingers raskolf kissed her neck and went back to sleep raskolf awoke just before the sun horse ascended the horizon he stepped out into the cold purple light and watched the dawn patrol undergoing their final inspection raskolf nursed the campfire back to life with the wood his daughter had gathered the previous day and sat down with his pipe as the fire was slowly revived the pink and golden hues of the rising sun began to creep across the autumn landscape warming the blue shadows of night raskolf rose to his feet to salute the dawn patrol as they passed he remained standing after they were gone squinting in the early light it was nearing the anniversary of the battle that changed their lives anjan ravensmark used to like sunrises too they were both warriors once upon a time raskolf remembered well the last sunrise that anjan ever saw it was bloody and red the sun horse ascended to clouds of yellow raskolf was the inspecting packleader that day and he had selected the route they were to take that morning it was his fault that they were ambushed he should have taken the patrol back to the village when the tracks were discovered but he decided to do some further scouting first breka norri and hranbjorn were killed in the initial ambush grolf lost both his legs anjan received a severe head injury the entire patrol would have been lost were it not for her she fought like a rabid animal striking so hard that she broke her weapon on an opponent she killed six more with just the hilt and her fists anjan headbutted the mordok chieftain so hard that her helmet became embedded in his face and slipped off of her head she suffered many wounds but only went down after getting a mace buried in her skull the patrol managed to fend off the attackers just long enough for the village to respond to their call for help raskolf smoked his pipe and watched the last member of the patrol disappear into the trees raskolf didnt lead patrols anymore his job was to guard the priestess he followed her by day and slept with her at night she was the mother of his daughter the job he had been given was the most honorable position a warrior could hope for but it was also his penance he loved her but he couldnt forgive himself for what had happened to her it had been ten years she permanently lost her sight when she took that mace to the head and in the fevered nightmares of her recovery the goddess spoke to her anjan had become a priestess and raskolf was her warder  rhodi grinned to himself and pulled not only his blankets but the young girl within them closer to himself on the other side of the curtain he could hear the toiling of his new apprentice as she stoked the coals in the forge and muttered under her breath until recently it would have been rhodi up early to prepare the smithy taking in that refugee from clan winterclaw was one of the best ideas hed ever had yep rhodi sighed to himself gaia rewards my generosity and compassion by letting me sleep in ylsa the girl in his bed rolled in her sleep so she was facing him and draped her arm across his chest ylsa was from a clanless pack in the mountain range known as the wolfs hackles shed originally just been passing through watchwolf territory on a personal mission to collect and compile the saga and poetry of the different clans but decided to stay a while after she met rhodi gaia also rewards me for paying attention to all those stories and songs as a child he thought grinning so hard his eyes squeezed shut on the other side of the curtain drifas aching shoulders and back crackled and popped in the cold morning air working the smithy was the hardest labor she had ever performed but every time she was ready to quit and just walk away rhodi taught her something new which made her want to stay and learn at first hed had her cutting peat moss from the bog and digging fire pits shed almost had enough but then as she tended a fire pit one day burning a huge clump of earth from the bog and wondering what in gaias name she was doing rhodi reached into the fire with a rod and pulled out a big glowing lump of molten iron it was like sorcery the mineral had separated from the vegetation in a fire so hot that it seemed to burn with unnatural color and drifa had played a part in that magic currently she had made it as far as hammering the ball of raw iron flat than melting it into a ball again then hammering then melting the process had to be done sixty times with every piece rhodi didnt let drifa actually shape any tools or weapons yet and to be honest she wouldnt even know where to begin he said that he was teaching her patience and that patience took longer to learn than anything else his constant quoting of poetry and song annoyed drifa almost as much as the way that ylsa actually took notes every time he regurgitated the words of agnon hara or sig  raskolf had tobacco smoke for breakfast and washed it down with hot cider being the warder of the clan high priestess not only kept him off of the military campaigns but meant that the people provided for his family so he didnt even hunt anymore he rarely practiced his melee skills either unless he were training his daughter elise the sword lately he hadnt been doing much of that either as his brothers lover ylsa had been spending time doing that true there was the occasional mordok attack but raskolf and his ward were too important to be allowed anywhere near the front lines so he didnt ever really fight anymore the sedentary lifestyle so uncharacteristic to an ulven warrior was perhaps why raskolf just rarely seemed to get hungry in the morning and rarely ate anything until after midday raskolf read a lot this was also quite uncharacteristic of an ulven warrior most of whom could not even read or write so much as their own name raskolf however had learned to read and write upon assuming his duties as anjans warder written language was a divine gift given to the ulven in ancient times there were few books however and most folks didnt find writing or reading to be terribly useful compared to drinking hunting and killing mordok the three main ulven pastimes many ulven communities only possessed one or two books and typically the only people who ever read them were the priestesses and storytellers raskolf vakr had what was quite possibly the largest private collection of books in the entire ulven nation he had acquired almost all of them all at once on a trip to newhope eight years ago raskolf had been sent to learn about humans and syndar from the nightriver clan it was one of his first missions as anjans warder back when she was just a novice daughter of gaia raskolf and the others had met with a few humans at a formal function in the new colony and briefly talked to them but with all the posturing acting and silly formalities he didnt really feel that hed learned anything about them besides how they behaved when they were trying to impress the syndar didnt even talk to him and from their body language he could tell that they didnt like the way he smelled in all fairness however he thought they smelled like funeral incense which kind of creeped him out at the conclusion of the dinner the humans had a really boring dance with strange music there were lots of snacks though the syndar tried to teach a dance to the ulven but it was ridiculously overcomplicated about halfway through the instruction raskolf realized that the pointyears were just trying to make his people look stupid he could see the laughter in their eyes though their faces appeared stoic raskolf didnt know if he could ever trust anyone who was that good at lying he felt bad for his senior leaders and was thankful that he was a simple bodyguard and not a politician the expedition was supposed to make the ulven feel more at ease around the colonists and vice versa in many ways it had the opposite effect if raskolf did learn anything on that trip it was that humans were dangerous it wasnt due to anything in particular that happened but rather the way they behaved around ulven the problem with humans was that they were cowards the humans were afraid of the ulven this fear seemed to inspire them to do stupid things especially when they had numbers a lone human would defer to a lone ulven almost as a rule and even try to avoid them when they got into large groups however the humans would start trying to show off to each other by subtle and notsosubtle means these could range anywhere from rude gestures or language to blatant insults directed at the ulven raskolf didnt like that it made him nervous to see how twofaced these newcomers could be they reminded him of wild dogs they were afraid of wolves and pretended to respect them but turned on them the instant they had numbers the syndar on the other hand were always rude they had no such fears of the ulven the syndar looked down on everyone as equals which is to say that all people were created equally inferior they werent afraid of not being the best they simply knew that they were the superior race and treated everyone accordingly they were kind of like cats they didnt give a damn about the ulven but at the same time they were curious about them the trip would have been a complete waste of time to raskolf but for a pleasant accident at the dance raskolf found a coin purse upon the floor picked it up and found the owners monogram embroidered inside he was surprised to recognize most of the runes and even figured out who it belonged to when he returned it to the syndar lady with the silver skin she made a rude comment oh she scrunched up her face this one thanks you raskolf bowed politely as he had seen others do and turned to walk away that one must have identified my property by scent what a noble hound actually he said turning back to face her i read it it is a strange variation of our northern alphabet and i dont recognize all the letters but it sounded out to something like your name ezra beloved of the platinum moon so i took a guess that it was yours raskolf showed his back to them and rejoined poor anjan who wasnt handling the crowd and the noise very well later that evening as they were about to leave raskolf was approached by a plainly dressed purplehaired syndar in spectacles the young lady introduced herself as one clever clover leaf in the field of knowledge but told raskolf to call her either clover or cici she was the scribe and attendant to lady ezra clover presented raskolf with a book open to a certain page and asked him to read it for her at first raskolf hesitated but anjan urged him to give it a try wake from him forever sleep raskolf slowly read the frost element growl of retreat down fast beating his wings in pain the jealous master his greybrowd warders thunder warriors strong veterans among helmet and shields and cariots horses elepants flags castles slings and earth very good exclaimed clover that was pretty close are you sounding them out purely from phonetics or do you recognize some of the words a little of both i think he started confused not only by her enthusiasm but also by the word phonetic some of it is sounds from the runic alphabet some are runes of whole words a lot of it is spelled wrong though and the order of the words is different from how it would be spoken aloud but i can put it together well enough to say it to you in common let me read it to you now said clover waked from his eternal sleep the hoary element roaring fled away down rushed beating his wings in vain the jealous king his grey browd councillors thunderous warriors curld veterans among helms and shields and chariots horses elephants banners castles slings and rocks is a chariot something you drink out of asked raskolf i think so giggled anjan but seriously though what does elephant mean this is fantastic cried clover great the noble savage can read muttered raskolf to himself lets sell tickets raskolf said anjan i really dont understand why she is so excited that i can read a variation of my own language translate it and say it out loud in common grumbled raskolf  its not your language exclaimed clover its the word of a human named blake and this book is written in celestial angirthan runic you are reading an antiquated language from way back before the unification it isnt a totally dead language but it is uncommon to see it outside of university universe city asked anjan i have no idea muttered raskolf maybe that is where the sun and the moon are from said anjan it would make sense since they are the gods who gifted us with writing clover still hadnt actually stopped talking but the two ulven were pretty sure that she had stopped talking to them and was just talking to herself now she hadnt heard a thing they had said when she finally settled down she gave raskolf the book which she called an anthology and asked to meet with him and her lady ezra platinum at the library of new hope before the ulven delegation left the next day raskolf tried to politely refuse since the delegation was to leave quite early and he really wasnt sure that satisfying curiosity was worth having to tolerate the snobbery of lady platinum anjan however insisted that raskolf make the meeting and stated quite firmly that she would delay the departure of the watchwolves so he might attend  clover practically skipped through the halls never in her studies of language or magic had she been so excited as she was tonight this was big this could change everything she couldnt wait to tell her lady where goes that one so elated and at such an hour said a voice oh exclaimed clover tenebrus has startled me please forgive this ones loss of composure this one has discovered something important and is excited to relay a message to her lady platinum indeed said tenebrus melting forth from the shadow preceded visually by the gleam of white teeth upon dark flesh the color of stale blood this one would be pleased to hear that one might share in such elation this one really must report to her lady first but means no disrespect clover started to leave but tenebrus blocked her path clever clover hissed tenebrus such a clever clever girl this one asked politely this one will not ask again of course elder tenebrus stammered clover the tips of her ears drooping submissively this one was excited because she discovered that the written runes of the ulven to the north are remarkably similar to celestial angirthan they are so similar in fact that a member of the ulven delegation was able to read from one of this ones books the one who read the book is from a tribe called the watchwolves of luna and his mate was introduced as a priestess of the watchwolves of sol inferring that they have some sort of cultural connection to the moon and sun just like our people clover held her breath as she waited for a reaction from tenebrus this one is very interested said tenebrus this one will accompany clever clover come along child tenebrus is hurting this ones arm exclaimed clover tenebrus said nothing this is not the way to lady platinums chamber tenebrus said nothing and once the shadows engulfed the two syndar neither did clover  raskolf arrived early at the library and sat in uncomfortable silence until long after the syndar girl was late he waited and waited she still didnt show up raskolf eventually got bored and started looking through books he couldnt read any of them they were in a different language finally he approached the librarian who was an elderly human woman im looking for books in agathan he said the librarian smirked at him you must mean celestial angirthan runic she said yes that is a challenging and ancient language it is typically only used in yes i know universe city right said the librarian but what i was trying to say is that it is not an easy language to learn it is very complicated and has in addition to a very long phonetic alphabet an extensive and exhaustive set of word character runes whats this all about then a human scholar interrupted this gentle barbarian wants to learn to read well actually i was hey cousin come hither this savage wants to read and in angirthan no less direct him to the childrens primers laughed another human im not here to learn to read growled raskolf im just looking for some books probably a book on hygiene muttered the mans cousin oh of course said the first scholar im sure that you read in fact let me guess you are looking to translate and transcribe your own copies of our texts to enrich your primitive culture what a noble venture i can read agathan raskolf said slowly oh really said the scholars cousin well if you can and i am certain you cannot since you dont even know how to pronounce the word angirthan then i will give you all the books of that language in my personal library to keep forever and ever in dog years and if i cannot then you have to publicly denounce your silly barbarian gods and crawl out of new hope on all fours with a bone in your mouth down the main street and out the main gate raskolf thought about it a moment he grinned oh woe is me moaned raskolf in an overly theatrical manner thou hast taken advantage of a poor heathen the weakness of his race i cannot turn down a challenge to do so would be to dishonor the ancestors of my clan very well then produce the book of which i cannot properly pronounce the name and i will try to read it with my primitive brain raskolf gestured to his stomach as he said the last part invoking laughter from even the old librarian a book was placed in front of him and opened to a random page oh please said raskolf looking towards the ceiling i implore and invoke you my apparently inferior and numerous gods to have mercy upon me and rescue me from dishonor raskolf studied the book for a while he scratched his chin scratched his head and inhaled sharply a few times as though he were about to start reading but then said nothing right then he said i read it please pay up read it out loud smart ass remarked the scholar very well raskolf said clearing his throat the knights bones are dust and his good sword rust his soul is with the saints i trust say said raskolf that isnt blake is it the others all stared in shock their jaws open wide to match their eyes no replied the librarian its coleridge ah yes replied raskolf cold bridge of course from universe city i was reading some blake last night now about those books you owe me the scholars cousin bared his teeth and his eyebrow twitched as though he may have burst a major blood vessel deep within his brain or perhaps his belly well you know what they say said raskolf the fox condemns the trap not himself now thats blake said the librarian the syndar girl never showed up but raskolf was rather pleased with himself for acquiring six new books in such a clever way he figured that clever clover would agree too bad he never got to say goodbye to her before he left the city of new hope she was the first syndar that he had found tolerable he had just finished recounting his tale of cunning to the rest of the delegation and the other troops much to the delight of the travelers when he noticed a rather uncomfortable look on anjans face whats wrong he asked are you worried about clover not showing up huh no no raskolf i wasnt really paying attention sorry im pregnant  but that was eight years ago anjan and raskolfs daughter elise was seven years old now anjan was the clan high priestess for both the moon and the sun camps of the watchwolves a position also referred to as the heart of the watchwolves as her warder raskolf was now the voice of the watchwolves which basically meant that he was an ambassador the position had been created especially with him and anjan in mind the problem with sending anjan to political functions was simple it wasnt that she embarrassed the clan with her eccentricities nor did it have anything to do with her handicap at least not directly ok maybe a little the real problem was that she had no tact when anjan spoke it was always from her heart and exactly anything and everything that was on her mind she burned quite a few bridges simply by being too honest with important people and occasionally by talking to spirits that no one else could see there was no doubt that she was the chosen of gaia and her ability to channel mystical and spiritual energy was seemingly on par with the most legendary of ulven heroines but she simply couldnt be left on her own in public anjan was very wise but lacked social grace raskolf being her mate for life in addition to being her warder was entrusted by the clan with authority to speak on anjans behalf regarding certain matters he was also entrusted to help feed her help her dress herself in matching clothes scratch her left shoulder blade and basically make sure she didnt get lost for that purpose he had affixed jingly bells to her totemic staff it made her easier to keep track of he told people that they were spirit bells if they asked though it was rare that the two of them should be anywhere near a combat raskolf also made sure that his priestess was pointing in the right direction before she started calling down elemental lightning and divine fury upon the battlefield they were a good team this morning raskolf finished his first mug of cider and then prepared to wake anjan and bring her breakfast hed already forgotten about her episode that night raskolf sat with anjan and elise while they ate breakfast when elise had finished anjan sent her to go and play with one of her friends raskolf she said after elise was gone we need to talk raskolf cringed at those words so universally feared by every married man alive i had a vision she said and yes love i know it to be a vision and not just a dream i was told by the great black wolf that when i awoke this day i would be able to smell a strange scent upon the horizon i do i dont know what it is but i need to find out it is important the great wolf usually gaia speaks to you not the great wolf it troubles me love what does it smell like asked raskolf kind of like the changing leaves in autumn but sadder and without the hope of rebirth it is almost as though the trees fear that though they die every year this year will be a different death bittersweet but without the sweet indeed love indeed well anjan what are we to do we are to travel west and south organize an expedition we leave tomorrow i have to find out where it is coming from well now love started raskolf dont forget that tomorrow is this is more important go well muttered raskolf that escalated quickly i have expressed my will make it so raskolf kissed her then grumbling left to do her bidding as he walked down the path villagers were already lining up to see his wife for healing and sage advice  go along home said anjan and tell your mother to keep that arm bound until luna finishes her pass this cycle the priestesss scarred and calloused hands did not slow as they stirred the contents of an clay pot hung over the fire the steam rising from it heavy and acrid raskolf always worries around me around fire she said to the eyes and the ears since her head injury she didnt seem to feel hot and cold very well and frequently burned herself or started herself on fire as a result he always tells me to watch out for this or dont touch that or watch my hair around the torches trivial things if he spent as much time worrying about doing what i said as he does secondguessing me when i tell him to go and do something now what do i get attitude thats the problem with being married to your warder if we werent married hed listen better i guarantee it once a man gets in your skirt though its as if anjan realized that she hadnt heard the little girl leave yet are you still there the little girl nodded in terror a gesture missed completely by the blind woman dont dawdle tunglkalfur or ill box your ears youve work to do at home i am certain but i you still have one arm dont you anjan said pointing a wooden spoon no where near the general direction of the little girl i dont make excuses for my eyesight do i of course not high priestess ravensmark the little girl squeaked terrified to say anything more now send in the next person and you run home the girl ran off her bare feet pattering in the dust despite the cold of morning anjan stirred the pot with a wooden spoon occasionally pausing to taste the liquid within or add something from the array of clay bowls pots and glass jars lining the shelves her witches and daughters of gaia had tried to set up an organizational system for their blind matriarch which involved placing different ingredients into specific slots and holes in a specially shaped tray but anjan wasnt that organized ultimately she just left bottles jars and pots wherever she left them and used smell and taste to confirm the contents anjan ravensmark was a heavybodied woman square of shoulder and broad of hip a fierce warrior once her sight had been lost after a nearfatal head wound an injury that cost her not only her sight but her place in an elite warpack known as the tundra wolves however with the loss of her physical sight came a newfound vision the thoughts and wishes of the first mother manifested in her waking dreams soon a bemused anjan had found herself entering the novitiate taking her first faltering steps on the path to serving gaia and guiding her children ten years past that had been and she had never regretted the loss of her sight beyond her first mourning the mother of all had blessed her with sight beyond the veil and a devoted mate that guided her steps in the physical world so that she might walk with strong steps in the spiritual one once a hunter and warrior wellblooded now she tended the bodies and souls of the silverhowl pack with practicality and a dedication that neared fanaticism though she had risen to the position of clan high priestess she never forgot her duties to her pack and her village her attention right now was not on the concoction in her simmering pot or on the girl running with awestruck steps back to her waiting mother anjans clothwrapped gaze was fixed upon the clouded sky beyond the ceiling and walls of her dwelling something was in the wind something wrong anjans upper lip curled back from her elongated canines an involuntary reaction earlier it had been a faint smell and just a little sad now there was the bitterness of dried salt sweat or perhaps blood and iron the sadness was giving way to fear she could smell fear she wrinkled her nose the ulven hate the smell of fear as much as the mordock love the smell of horse meat anjan sneezed she would have to consult the bones that night as luna cast her silver light from high above the world she would have to check the signs and portents a shiver ran up her spine as she stirred the pot thinking perhaps it was time to call a rettir a gathering of the pack once she had cast her augeries and gained what further knowledge the great wolf and the first mother deemed fit to share with her  rhodi stretched beneath his covers and cuddled closer to ylsa the sun was up and the forge was up to temperature but the warmer it got in his smithy the more comfortable he became until he had lost any motivation to leave the protection of his furs nor the softness of his woman he was however thirsty his eyes protected from the light of morning by a knit cap pulled over his eyes he groped blindly for a bottle he could only use one arm because there was a girl sleeping on his other and he didnt want to wake her his hand closed around one that he recognized by shape to be ginger wine but to his dismay it was empty further pawing stretching and groping recovered two cider bottles a beer bottle and a wineskin but all were empty his blind one armed search accidently emptied the contents of ylsas satchel all over the floor brother called raskolf from somewhere on the other side of the curtain brother where are you i need to speak to you its important give me a moment give me a moment grunted rhodi unintentionally rolling his woman up in a bundle of furs and blankets as he pushed her out of the way to get up rhodi tried to take off his hat but the light was too bright and he stumbled blind and naked from his bedding with an empty bottle in one hand ripping the curtain aside he stood face to face with his brother raskolf rhodi put on some pants next time said raskolf why belched rhodi scratching his parts and grinning blindly beneath his hat because said raskolf one it is lunch time and two he added ripping off rhodis hat and throwing it into the wiggling pile of furs and blankets behind his brother we arent the only people in the shop right now rhodi cringed at the light and cursed his brother as his vision returned he noticed that there were two young ladies waiting patiently in the shop with leather armor to be mended one of the girls was blushing like a ripe apple and trying to hide her face the other ones jaw was hanging open and she looked quite terrified well i wasnt naked till you took off my hat rhodi yelled after his brother just get dressed and come to the longhouse rhodi yawn longfang harlok longfang yawn sat at the back table of the tavern drinking his drink smoking his pipe the mead was flowing just fine that night the younglings had been given leave to take the name they choose and more importantly yawn was now free of the good awful long named imposed on him as a protection to confuse and confound those thing that creep int he night and happily drag off the young yawnrick eix nifflem longfang where did his mother even find that many letters to string together the bar was full of younglings like yawn all eager to start the trails but unlike yawn most all of them had the eyes or had the fangs come in yawn had neither as of yet a trio at the bar start in on it drunk very very drunk the three of them one start in hey why do you think yawnricks not come into the eyes or even the fangs yet the second  poor luck the third or poor blood in his father line perhaps she didnt choose so well yawn what you do you think i think i will say when i finish my pipe an my mead yawn manged flatly with only a tinge of irritation hmph the way he smokes wed be waiting all night thing went on that way the trio gossiping loudly forgetting about yawn entirely then the one in the middle piped up once more do you think mayhap it isnt to do with yawn at all maybe it to do with who or what his mother choose maybe she laid with a human or a syndar the taunt went on but yawn had stop listening right then yawns father had bested four warriors hand to hand to convince his mother he was worthy of being chosen four warriors of her choosing victories that has not come easily kragen and harlok two among the four both had broken ribs kragen had disjointed his shoulder and hed chipped a fang in one the bought and could not speak as harlok broke his jaw in the last bought his father manged it in one night and it took three months to recover from the bought all told three months yawn was longfang through and through yawn quietly emptied and filled his pipes bowel downed his mug of mead and very quietly strode over to the trio tapping the center youth on the shoulder and as he turned yawn loosed a sucker punch so vicious it drew blood and cracked the center youths fang his friend to the left raised his heavy tankard to bring it down across yawns head but he was seated he could not move as fast yawn saw the arm and what it held he slid his arm up the seated youths shoulder and cupped his hand at the back of his neck trapping arm and with all his weight brought head down against the bar in a savage arch yawn brought his head down another two times with less force but the first seemed to of had the desired effect of putting the second out of the fight though that was when things stopped going so well for yawn there was a crash and his vision swam  some had struck him int he back hard very hard yawn spun a bit more slowly but the strike had only served to fuel yawns anger the third being bright or perhaps just having much more time to react then his friends had shattered a stool over yawns back yawn leapt at him and the fight went to the ground the third beat at yawn with the former stool leg in the end yawn slipped to his back and levered the club against his foes neck choking him senseless his eyes still blurry he checked that he hadnt over held the choke it took three minutes time hed been told all his life but gaia help him if hed killed another youngling no kill breathing just fine good yawn stumbled back to his table filled his pipe lit it from the tables candle and drew deeply he scooped up his mug and limped to the bar he going to live the keep asked theyll remember tonight but all be fine in a few days well swore but fine make it a full mug the priestess will not be best pleased with my defense of my mothers good name like to be my last for some time yawn sighed drew on his pipe and waited for the guards that would by now be a very short time from he tavern door hed accept he punishment whatever it was this had been wrong if hed of called for a duel they may of cowered and backed down and that would be the end of it or beaten one senseless and be done with it now hed beaten all three senseless and was none the better for it this is going to be a long week yawn muttered at the guards crossed the threshold and he downed his mead of course right then yawn couldnt know how right he would be  two of the onsallas village guards walked into the tavern connected to the longhouse they had heard the commotion and stepped inside to see what was going on they surveyed the scene and instantly knew that words and then fists were exchanged yawn was quietly drinking his mead and it was obvious what had happened the guards moved towards yawn deliberately but not threateningly knowing he would comply and serve his punishment alright yawn i know stanrick can get into some trouble but this is new said the longfang guard as he grabbed yawns arm and slowly began to pull him away from the bar the guards hadnt noticed a figure had walked up behind the two of them until an armor clad gauntlet reached out and grasped the shoulder of one the guards the act was instantly regarded as hostile as interfering with the village guards is a serious offense dont interfere with our duties you want to join him in the stocka said the guard whose voice was quickly cut short he had turned as he spoke until he locked gaze with harlok longfang the ulven who had interrupted them harloks piercing lupine eyes summed up the guard and his quiet and stone still pose had been enough to silence the guard the younger guard was confused and not sure what to do next harloks gaze then went to the three bloodied whelps on the floor then up to yawn who sat quietly and bloodied a bit himself it was obvious that yawn had defeated the three younglings and then waited for his punishment harlok walked over close to yawn and grabbed his wrist raising it up and pointing towards his bicep yawn looked confused until harlok then pointed at the three younglings on the tavern floor yawn nodded and harlok grinned with a bit of surprise harlok reached out and clasped yawns forearm in a sign of respect and nodded in approval harlok then turned and locked eyes with the two guards who still stood their confused harlok pointed at the two guards then to the three younglings and then motion outside he punctuated this fact with a deep growl and a bearing of fangs the guards complied and scooped up the worst of the the younglings and dragged them outside harlok then strode out of the bar and left yawn there in silenceryla larksfield the morning sun played across the sea from her seat next to the window ryla stared uneasily at the view shed watched thousands of times before the winter apple was very nearly deserted and it was no surprise many had fled dellastern already hoping to escape the undead scourge that now threatened its gates the docks were very near chaos by tonight theyd devolve into all out warfare as those still in the city sought escape the temple rose waited guards wary and impatient still she knew it would not leave until she was aboard her gaze returned to the horizon before the sun set again she would be sailing past that horizon shed never been farther away from this cesspit she called home what would life be like as a refugee in a new alien continent it was a blessing that shed spent her life hiding the terror she felt or shed have shaken the ale right out of her glass heavy boots trod in and up to her table she recognized his gait before she saw him he downed half of his mug of beer before he acknowledged her had it been anyone else ryla would have found the gesture insulting it was hard to feel offended though when a person drags himself from the front lines of a bloody battle to meet you for drinks he looked like hed aged a decade his normally impeccable calm shattered he was dirty and unkempt but it was the slump of his shoulders a vaguely haunted look to him that made ryla shift uncomfortably in her seat when he finally did speak his voice still held the authoritative grumble she had always found comforting but there was an icy edge to it she reminded herself that he was her friend she had nothing to fear from himno matter how many men hed killed you shouldnt be here she forced herself to meet his eyes and you should be fleeing the city with me but it appears were both too stubborn for our own good sure sure whats with the muscle she shrugged dismissing the thugs behind her without a glance dangerous times a girl cant be too careful i believe it was your turn he laughed one of these days youre going to have to outgrow these games but he turned his attention to the chess board shed set between them he moved his rook quickly then leaned back tiredly and examined his opponent martins dead ryla started i thought hed outlive us all im sorry no one lives forever he saved my life the big idiot then he added with an uncharacteristically roguish grin i suspect ill be seeing him soon enough youre an idiot too she dropped her gaze pretending to be examining her predicament on the board is there anything i can do anyone i can find he shook his head i told you last time there isnt anyone all my friends are out there dying right along with me he didnt seem bothered by the thought or leavingwhile she was ignoring that he took another long drink and pulled at his leather armor like it was too tight he lived in armor and shed never once seen him look uncomfortable is it bizarrely hot in here or is it just me she smiled sweetly it is a bit she picked up his king and turned it slowly in her hand you really think dying out there is going to make a damn bit of difference my men     he began his throat had become scratchy his voice hoarse     arent out there because of you they have their own reasons or they wouldnt stay the undead and the penitent are going to roll through this city like a storm sweeping away any poor fool in their way speeches made him suspicious but he was beyond the point where hed be able to do anything about it and ryla knew it perhaps shed hoped to explain herself but he simply stared daggers at her people had stared daggers at her before but there was something coldly murderous in his manner that made her stop philosophizing she smiled again but it was tight and self conscious she placed his piece back on the board checkmate his face twisted in anger and understanding as her eyes flicked to his glass then they rolled up and he slumped onto the table then fell to the floor she knelt next to him making sure he was breathing evenly then picked up his king again and pocketed it before motioning for the two goons to lift him duncan became slowly aware that the floor was moving alone the sensation would have been odd with the demonic gala rolling around in his stomach it was a new level of torment half awake he rolled over and was sick fleabitten hells a young woman exclaimed opening his eyes he saw ryla just out of range of the mess she looked at him and grinned despite his sickness she offered him a mug of something brackish that also smelled like vomit when he turned his nose up at she admonished him with a bizarrely maternal look itll help you feel human again he propped himself up and drank it as quickly as he could it isnt working she handed him a water skin to wash it down you have to give it a minute she went about cleaning the floor next to him while his mind caught up to his body it was slow going but eventually he did start to feel less terrible he grabbed her arm realization finally dawning on him were on a ship uhhuh his grip tighten as he followed the line of logic you drugged me   guilty     and kidnapped me well strong men have been kidnapping young women for centuries a little turn about is fair play when he failed to let go of her am she pried his hand off one finger at a time and sat down next to him trying to look innocent im fairly sure i was saving your life yes and how exactly did you go about that she shrugged i had my cohorts carry you to the ship i told the captain you were my father that you were in your cups again why he growled i need you what just a wealth of conversation arent we when he responded with a glare she continued the new worlds dangerous i need someone with martial skills to make sure i stay in one piece so you just plucked on off the street his voice pitched oddly shed heard him angry but there was a note of disbelief that was new againsaved ones life would be more accurate he didnt wait for her explanation hed already stood up and began pacing who the hell do you think you are you cant just haul a man off to a different continent and expect him to be your faithful servant who said anything about a servant i just said i needed help and thats what its all about isnt it what you need rylas jaw clenched when she spoke it was icey exactly i guess youve finally figured me out he grabbed her bag and tossed it to her go i never want to see you again thats going to be a bit difficult she sidled past him calmer than she felt were on a ship idiot there was a soft glow on the horizon or maybe he was just imagining it the ship had a subdued happiness to it it was the quiet celebration of survivors who had a very long way yet to go but duncan couldnt tear his eyes away from the glow he couldnt make himself stop seeing the dead walking or otherwise in his mind he walked dellasterns streets played witness to the blood and the carnage that must have been happening that very second silently killing and rekilling all of the poor souls hed left behind even he admitted it to himself it was a bit morbid but after a lifetime as a mercenary his imagination had plenty to work with then there was a man standing next to him handing him a drink which he begrudgingly accepted you must be rylas dad said the newcomer duncan snorted in disgust must i the stranger had the nerve to laugh nah i know shes an orphan hell everybody who knows her knows shes an orphan not shy that one apparently the captain didnt know or he didnt care she has a way of ingratiating herself after all duncan growled deep in his throat but the other man didnt seem to find his bad temper intimidating in fact he seemed to find it rather amusing shes got rotten luck though  saving the only man in aldoria who apparently hates her for it the two stood in silence for several moments duncan stood stock still in anger the other man proving to be surprising patient for a nuisance finally duncan caved i dont hate her because she saved my life i just    the glow was still there the only funeral pyre for an entire city thousands of innocent women and children are dying have died and she manages to drag one stupid old man out of it and not because im her friend because i can be of use to her did she say that not that its any of your business but yes she said she needed someone to help her in mardrun the sailor shook his head like there was a particularly funny joke in that well pride makes us all do stupid things sometimes i guess i can see your point all her hard won connections and she rescues one person and she chooses you then has the nerve to ask you for help id be pissed too duncan downed the rest of his drink his shoulders slumped in defeat youre right people do what they have to do to survive far be it for me to expect anything more from her he went to leave but the sailor grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him round to face the ship he pointed to a family huddled round their dinner hes a butcher months ago his son got sick took all the money they had to treat him they had nothing when they received word that the undead were headed for the city he pointed to another woman very obviously pregnant being sick over the side shes a whore or was shes got a few gold in her pocket a place on this ship a home and job all lined up in the new world a new life for her and her child assuming it makes the crossing theres a young man downstairs who escaped a rather unpleasant life under the thumb of a particularly pernicious crime lord by boarding this ship and a few dozen more stories just like that great there is good in the world hurray duncan countered wearily the sailor rolled his eyes and leaned on the rail casually whys she only got one bag what whys ryla only got one bag with her light as air so you know it isnt stuffed with gold she wasnt poor made a pretty good living for herself back in the city she knew she was leaving she even had time to plan your kidnapping and crossing youve no doubt noticed she brought things aboard for you so wheres her wealth figured the undead could use it more i suppose duncan took a moment he looked for the first time at the faces of the people on the ship before him lay a vessel full of living breathing people who had escaped aldoria i dont suppose you let these people cross out of the goodness of your heart did you the captain grinned back me gods no im a businessman rylad been making the rounds seeing to old friends and making new ones no one had disturbed her bag duncan wondered if it was because they respected its owner or because everyone knew there was nothing of value to take hed been expecting her to look a bit happier when she saw him but her frown turned bitter whered you get that she motioned to the chess board hed set up on the floor he picked up one of the pieces that had fallen over chessboards and ships apparently didnt mix he gave her his best impression of a sheepish smile the captain lent it to me nice guy she eyed him in obvious distrust but took a seat across the board from him on the floor yes indeed and disturbingly prone to sticking his nose where it doesnt belong thinks hes clever says a benefactor filled his ship nearly to bursting with downtrodden unfortunates heading to mardrun that she went broke doing it but that she saved all of their lives when ryla remained still and silent he continued he says she has nothing that she wont last the winter without help looking bored ryla asked so why didnt you tell me why did you let me act like such an ass one i dont have the time or energy to control your assheaded tendencies two and more importantly i dont have to justify myself to you but you could have mentioned it yes i could have then what youd forgive me and spend the rest of your life lauding my goodness i got that money from a decade of being a selfish little monster i still am and i always will be if thats going to be a problem for you then we should go our separate ways okay fine ill never think well of you again she sighed in frustration think well of me think ill of me fine ive probably earned both but i thought we were friends and not just when it suited you thank the gods i never had a daughter do women ever just accept an apology she arched an eyebrow unable to keep from smiling oh damnation    im sorry apology accept also checkmate and i mean the game this timeour most powerful cleric had been killed so many warriors wounded beyond our remaining clerics ability to help we cant hold out for too much longer it had been 90 days since the first attack then 16 since the second and the third had yet to happen we were still waiting tensely rebuilding repairing we had started to relax with hope that no more attacks would come our main focus was on home to prepare for the coming winter i had been running back and forth from the blacksmith who was making nails to those who were doing repairs as fast as they could any able bodies were helping we all had to pitch in once we were done and finished with our chores the children knew we could play games with the rest of our day today we planned to play a game of tag we hadnt played it since the last attack echo senal needs nails as lilia the healers daughter passed me up i nodded and ran to the west side of the village senal was known as our village seer he had been accurate with everything so far which was frightening at times he had recently predicted a move of some kind but this was our home and nobody would accept that we were going to move we fight for our home we protect it all ulven knew that wandering over to the skeleton of senals home i raised a small fist full of nails thank you child with a pat on the head and a few brisk words we parted ways i ran to find tiresia my mother at the healing house when i pushed past the makeshift fur walls i slipped past anani and alali the last two clerics of our village i found them to look tired and worn this was probably their third time meditating this morning they were drained but we all had to do what we must to keep our people healing and fighting make sure not to bug them little echo looking at mother i nodded she put a finger to my lips before motioning her to come close senal says rain soon and a runner arrived with a hawk they told senal that help would be scarce for there was also a large attack of mordok up north and the warriors were sent that way first beaming to myself i felt proud i liked delivering messages and learning about what was going on in our lands it made what was happening at home seem tiny go out and tell everyone senal said rain ill finish up patching some of the wounds and come out to help with the roofs if senal is right with he usually is then theyll be needed most tonight she kept so composed though i knew she was worried i guess it had always been that way as the leader of our village in nightriver she had to make sure everything was going smoothly for everyone these past months with all the attacks and deaths it had left her so tired i ran along passing on the message of rain i made the last of my deliveries with the now empty nail bucket swinging at my side letting out a resounding thump i had to stop and hold the bucket aloft stopping the thumping on my side to recognize the sound of a horn two short blasts the others around me let out a holler of joy laughter spread slowly putting down their tools helping friends down from beams we all made our way to the central area of the village the hunting party had returned as i jumped getting a little taller each time to see what was going on strong hands wrapped around under my arms and lifted me atop lean shoulders calliope the best archer of our village beamed up at me and walked to the center to rejoin her huntmates we got a lot this time two elk a boar we even found a lot of healing regents so our healer should be well supplied again as i listened to her i looked around everyone did seem excited almost relaxed the cooking fire was slowly being kindled into life the midday meal would soon be on its way how long are you staying this time messing with her hair ive became oblivious to what was lurking outside the village as the small festivities started in celebration for the good fortune of our hunters we relaxed further im not sure but i plan to stay long enough to rebuild my hut i miss having a small space of my own plus the ground is getting a little too cold now lifting me from her shoulders she pulled me over to the carcass of the bigger elk there pointing at the puncture wound of an arrow i knew instantly what she wanted me to say you got into the windpipe a quicker death but kinda painful too i frowned a little sad for the poor creature i patted its soft nose rest well friend i turned away as the gutting and skinning commenced we headed for the fire the fall chill had slowly started setting in with the sun beginning its descent the cold seemed to seep into your bones it seemed our whole village was now in the center looking at some of the buildings i could see a few of the people still helping on the roofs it was peaceful sitting by the fireside as the meat and stew started cooking the people around me were made merry as things had started looking up i even saw some of the injured warriors clapping their hands as others danced in groups spinning and laughing everyone instantly froze as we heard the blast of a horn long and loud bellowed over the area the fighters jumped up and began racing to pull their weapons from their sheaths to defend the town from the coming threat calliope raced away from me her bow drawn up instantly as she nocked an arrow a scream let out from the eastern side of the village and smoke slowly began to rise from the edges of town people started running abandoning what they had been doing not only seconds ago to grab what they could for fighting the other children had started running i got swept away in it as we ran for cover seeking it in the piles of fire wood slipping into the gaps between the piles outside of our cover it seemed a war was being waged as our tiny hands grasped onto each other for security and comfort a warrior fell in front of us with an axe in his torso we held hands over our mouths to stop from screaming above the now deceased warrior the black face of a mordok stared at us a growling sneer spreading over its face as it bellowed a cry of victory it charged the children tried climbing up and over the piles of tumbling fire wood trying to scurrying away i couldnt move the axe came down fast it hardly missed me as i jerked farther back into the pile i hit the back of the pile there was no more room to push back into his axe raised again his muscles tensed as he started to swing forward and an arrow whizzed by a gurgle escaped its mouth as it dropped his weapon clattering down at my feet the arrow stuck out from its neck bleeding red over its body hands wrapped around my arm tugging hard i screeched long and loud against the sounds of clashing metal and grinding of footsteps on dirt hush echo its only me as i buried my face into calliopes shoulder i started to cry i wept in terror i wept for those around us and the fate of our village everyone around us was fighting bruised and wounded but still surging forward for our home our only hope but we knew it would hopeless with so many injured we had let ourselves relax and for that were caught so off guard we didnt have the strength to push back anymore sword in hand my mother approached us her face splattered with blood and the bottom of her pants was torn to the knee she turned to a warrior who was running by and stopped him how many are there im not sure they swarmed in too large of a group do we have the strength to fight them as her arms came up in a defensive position she watched all around us worry flashed openly over her face no maam too many are wounded from the last attack and we dont have the advantage they attacked us completely off guard the entire east side of the village is in flame and the main hall has been toppled and overrun we wont be able to hold for much longer with a fist over his heart and a short nod the warrior turned to help his brethren in the battle a silence fell as he left tiresia contemplated this would be the largest decision of our village nooo the word and all its anguish cut through the silence turning i watched anani cradling her sister a mirror image of herself a rage seemed to fill her as her arms shook around alali she screamed again and stood looking serene now she focused on drawing on her powers she primed 2 spells for instant death and calmly walked into the ensuing battle nobody stopped her peaceful calm dainty anani walked right to her death the battle consumed her we saw the blast of the magic she had with her and we could see her no more give me that conch ripping the horn from the hand of a nearby fighter she brought it to her lips long short long people started backing away form the fight towards us we were fleeing those who still had the strength protected our backs as we retreated i was thrust upon my mothers back as she ran helping to pull any who had slowed telling them to speed up looking back i saw anani once again lying by her sisters side as her chest was seeped with red the east side was covered in smoke the columns rising high into the sky i was sure the watch wolves in the north could see we ran away as fast as we could our fellow ulven around us surging through the woods on trails we knew well this was our home and the land had been our friend behind us i heard the guttural cry of victory the mordok knew they had won and that our village would be no more it crossed my mind that senal had been right maybe if we had listened and been willing to change this might not have happened to us a droplet fell onto my cheek with small grimy hands i wiped it away to find that it was covered all over in red two days later we simply need shelter temporary of course i can explain further about the movements of the mordok once my people are safe my mother walked away with the leader of this village i clung in earnest to the children around me we were drained exhausted of all strength we had been walking for two days and one full night half of our people were nodding off where they stood others were too paranoid to sleep thinking only of the danger and horror if they did in front of us calliope stood with two other women they stood like stone guarding us from the possible danger of the world to my left senal was being tended to the gash down his arm was angry and red he spoke to some of the local villagers who had come with questions telling them what had happened it seemed though from their reactions that none of them had heard of the attack on our village in the two days it had taken us to arrive here children peeked out from behind elders staring at us with large eyes i could not blame them we must have been a sight bloodstained bruised some with open wounds still needed tending to with slow determined steps tiresia returned a small smile over her face the leader of the village stood by her side an arm around her shoulder comforting we have been granted stay for as long as we need to heal and pick up our feet they have put aside the smaller tavern for us and some of the homes of the people around here have been opened for us as well rest easy my friends for when we can we are moving towards the center of nightriver territory and then we will rebuild our village drifting out of this world i fell asleep curled with the other children nodding off one by one we did not need to worry longer as our new found shelter will now keep us all safebloody anne cash commander vessel off the starboard bow she looks like the maiden for weeks commander ridgebon of the ias interceptor had been hunting the maiden of the sea a pirate ship infamous for its ruthlessness in dealing with any and all it encountered lieutenant anne cash had been straining her eyes on the horizon for days praying that she was not simply imagining the ship in the distance extending her spyglass she was greeted by the sight of the grisly masthead on the distant vessel a young woman nude from the waist up her face twisted in pain a sword held in her hand its blade extending into her abdomen this was the maiden of the sea to be sure you heard her boys sails to full bring us in close shes not getting away from me this time commander ridgebon stared intently towards the horizon focusing on his quarry four times had the interceptor come up on the maiden and each time did the pirate vessel manage to escape wanted for raiding dozens of merchant vessels and not known for leaving survivors captain anthony newall was a clever foe and knew when to run this time though there would be no escape the interceptor was fast enough and close enough that the maiden would not have time to flee get ready to board boys anne when shes in range light up some arrows and aim for her sails the commander was fueled by his fury at being bested time and time again by a mere pirate his crew would not be outdone this time as the interceptor drew near to her target the crew noticed something was amiss there was no movement on deck no flags of surrender flew a single young woman stood bound to the main mast her hands pinned to her sides and a rag in her mouth keeping her muffled cries quiet something was off but sailors are often quick to leap to the rescue of a fair young lady before any of the officers could shout a warning five men were setting the gangplanks to board the sitting vessel racing across to be the womans savior annes bow her oldest possession slid into her hand an arrow quickly finding its rest on the string her eyes scanned the ship looking for any movement which could mean trouble as the sailors reached the deck of the maiden a sudden shout sounded from the hull four men emerged from trapdoors in the deck brandishing swords another two wielded bows lieutenant cash drew and fired her arrow biting deep into the chest of one of the archers dropping him instantly the second archer however had time to ensure his arrow also struck true protruding from the neck of one of the sailors more sailors boarded and more pirates emerged from their hiding place quickly turning the battle bloody amidst the combat one of the sailors guarded by his allies drew his knife and began sawing at the bonds imprisoning the young woman on the mast as her arms fell free a sinister smile drew her lips upwards almost laughing as her hands began to move in a strange manner conjuring the latent energy around her before he had time to react the sailor who had freed the woman was hurtling through the air clear over the guardrails and into the waiting ocean soon enough another sailor was flung into the rear mast in a similar fashion knocking him out cold unaccustomed to battling against forces they could not see the sailors did their best to avoid this new threat giving the mage a wide berth and favoring combat against the steel swords of the pirates instead commander ridgebon had been surveying the melee from the deck of the interceptor waiting for his chance to strike shouting orders to his troops captain newall was still nowhere to be seen though so the commander stayed his hand anne was not so patient with two arrows left she drew and fired at the mage if her allies would not engage her then anne would have to do it herself as they say never send a man to do a womans job as the arrow screamed towards its target eager to pierce a limb it collided with the thin air around the mage with a faint wave of blue energy and fell to the ground wasted not used to fighting against magic anne stood in shock for a moment before nocking another arrow and releasing it as the mage began channeling another spell as she muttered the final incantation the arrow struck her leg lodging itself deep in the mages thigh just a moment before another warding spell was completed the annoyance on the mages face was matched only by the pain in her eyes clearly a stranger to injury the sailors despite their training were hardpressed to hold their position on the ship they had rallied since the ambush and had maneuvered into a defensive formation to shield those wounded in the original attack they were outnumbered and many were distracted by the mage fearful of being thrown overboard or worse during the chaos a figure had emerged from the hull of the ship a wiry man with a sharpened black hook where his right hand should have been and a grand red coat one illsuited to a life at sea come on ye salty dogs ill not have me ship fall to a bunch of dogooders captain newall shouted over his crew with no more arrows anne slid down the rigging to the deck of the interceptor drew her sword and ran across the gangplank to confront the mage two orbs of deep blue energy appeared in the mages hands which flew at the lieutenant dropping to her knees the first bolt flew past annes ear although the second struck her leg as she went to stand again knocking her leg out from under her tearing a small hole in her armored skirt unfazed anne found her footing again and charged the mage once again being met by the strange shield her second strike was more successful however sinking itself into the mages left arm before her third blow could connect anne was flung through the air landing gracelessly on her back once again surprised by the power within this young girl soon enough anne was back on her feet and approaching the mage once more preparing herself for another blast seeing his foe on deck commander ridgebon drew his sword and issued a challenge captain anthony newall he shouted his booming voice clearly audible even over the battle raging in front of him i commander jackston ridgebon on behalf of the king and people of aldoria order you and your crew to stand down surrender and justice will be brought upon you as dictated by aldorian law resist and the fury of the ias interceptor will rain down until you beg for death what say you i think well take our chances retorted captain newall were at an impasse but my men are patient weve got two men for each of yours its only a matter of time then lets settle this the old way captain a duel to the death captain to commander no tricks no interference or have you been spending too much time with the fairies to remember what honor is if any of ye lay a finger on him before im through youll suffer a fate worse than death commander i accept now draw focusing the arcane power within her the mage produced a scintillating ball of energy and hurled it at the lieutenant striking her in the stomach anne fell to her knees feeling as though someone had punched the air out of her lungs she stood to attack the mage again but found herself blinded stumbling around struggling to gain her bearings anne knew she was at the mercy of the mage she heard the shuffling of feet approaching her head on the dragging of the leg she had shot it was no use annes mind was alert but her body was sluggish at best she tried to brace herself for what was to come only to have the sense knocked back into her as she once again was sent flying this time both backwards and upwards carried aloft on a wave of concussive force the lieutenant crashed into the deck her sword torn from her hand as she began her flight her pauldron knocked askew by the impact the mage giving the same sinister grin she flashed at the first sailor she sent reeling kicked annes sword through a grate into the hull out of reach out of the fight the two men circled each other each taking minor swipes at the other the attacks were meant to test the opponent not to inflict any damage for what seemed like an hour the duel progressed neither side making any effort to strike with a quick lunge captain newall ended the game aiming straight for the commanders heart far too experienced to be taken by surprise the commander raised his blade deflecting the captains cutlass harmlessly to the left a number of cuts and thrusts followed from the commander each expertly blocked by his opponent back and forth they went nothing more than a few minor scrapes on each i grow bored with this game captain newall declared hansel fransel now at his command two hulking brutes stepped out of the crowd grabbing commander ridgebon by the arms and hoisting him from the ground tsk tsk tsk jackston expecting a pirate to fight fair im disappointed in you newall scolded pacing back and forth between his captive the commander made no effort to respond even his face remained stoic almost amused well we might as well end this captain newall drew his arm back to strike deep into commander ridgebons heart in a flash the commanders foot shot up connecting with the captains groin sending him reeling on the floor his sword clattering to the deck several sailors descended upon the men holding their commander quickly dispatching them and forming a barrier around the two officers to the death newall commander ridgebon slowly walked up to the captain who was just starting to regain his footing his fist clenched a man of many tricks however captain newall quickly drew a dagger from his boot and lunged at the commander taking him by surprise leaving the knife lodged in the commanders hip before falling to his knees the commander born and raised a sailor had grown accustomed to such pain however with a small groan he drew the dagger from his own flesh driving it down into his opponents back now ridgebon announced addressing the pirate crew get the hell off my ship anne and the mage paid no mind to the fight between the officers they were both more worried with staying alive as anne recovered from the previous blast she reached for her fathers dagger always in her belt once again she charged the mage who was visibly exhausted physically and mentally by this fight once again two glowing blue orbs appeared in the mages hands prepared to throw at her target the first bolt struck the lieutenants right shoulder sending her stumbling to the ground and knocking the dagger from her grip with too much momentum to turn and grab the weapon anne resumed her charge tackling the mage to the ground raining down blows with her leatherbound fist anne saw the mages hand still holding the second orb just as it was about to strike her not sure what to expect the lieutenant grabbed the mages wrist with both hands forcing her body weight down upon her young foe inching the magical orb closer and closer to the mages chest in a final desperate gambit the mage forced the bolt from her hand striking anne just below her ribs without her armor to absorb the blow anne was taken aback by the force with which she was hit she felt a rib crack and fell to the ground laying beside her magical opponent who was unnaturally still her face bloody and swollen the mage had summoned every last ounce of strength left in her body to throw her final spell praying for a miracle none came for her that day the day had been won captain newall was dead the maiden of the sea was in aldorian custody and losses were minimized on both sides after getting patched up with the ships surgeon anne returned to her normal perch in the crows nest she did not keep watch this night she was too concerned with her fight against the mage and how unprepared she was for such power silently anne prayed she prayed for the souls of her crew mates who had been lost during the fight she prayed for the pain in her ribs to stop mostly though she prayed to never have to fight another mage like that againstanrick longfang i see my brothers and i standing in a clearing there are rocks piled on the ground the sun is setting and even mordok stay away from the clearing the trees around are dead and dying and i feel darkness all around me it feels as if in this small patch of land gaia has left behind and never wishes to return stanrick was kneeling in the small smoke filled room across from him soulvieg sat mixing a potion your dreams show a disgraced land she said not even looking at stanrick sometimes when an ulven who lost their path that gaia puts before them and can not find their way before they pass they are not burned they are put in the ground some believe that gaia then cleans the spirit and then the spirit can go on its journey to meet the great wolf others believe that it is a way to punish the fallen spirit by keeping them from their journey such things are not up to us to decide  you mean like the graves where criminals are buried i was told to never step foot on that land i am surprised that so few know of this practice  stanrick looked up at soulvieg as she handed him the potion it is that way for a reason the high priestesses of past generations had their reasons one day you may have to set foot on the discarded lands the one in your dream may be older than any we know of and you may need to go there for reasons i can not see yet the runes speak riddles when consulted now drink that it will clear your mind and help you sleep she got up as stanrick turned his nose to the green liquid before he drank the potion he coughed and grimaced at the taste the place you saw may have been deep in the swamp the runes tell me of something beyond our reach the daughters have divined it as well until the time comes when you need to know about it you will not remember it just like the rest stanrick looked up puzzled the rest what what were we talking about he rubbed his head a little then got up stanrick i asked you to come in here so we could talk about your plan to set up supply caches on the hunting trails i think its a great idea he picked up his helmet off the ground oh right i forgot for some reason he said as she blinked and shook his head i see you havent had any dreams lately if you have any feel free to speak with me about it dreams can tell us a lot about our lives and the runes are sometimes tied to them soulvieg smiled stanrick nodded then he let him self out of the room rill was hidden in the corner but soulvieg knew she was there you can come out now my child rill came out from behind the curtains why do you make stanrick forget his dreams she asked his dreams may or may not have truth he is not ready to handle he has seen every one of his siblings fall he has seen mates die he saw the outsiders arrive when we thought we were the only ones in this world gaia has put much in his path and his dreams are a map that could guide him i only make him forget them until he needs to know what he has seen until we all know what he has seen replied the runeseer with a grave tone stanrick had a killer headache he picked up a bottle of mead from the porch of the great hall and took a swig as he started for the gate stanrick he knew his mothers voice from anywhere and turned to look at her you need to take the young ones with you siren just let the chickens lose in the bunk house and im not even going to say what yawn did youreden pulled yawn by his ear out of the bunkhouse then went back in to grab siren so you get them out of here and take them with you to the outpost maybe you can find something for them to do stanrick finished the mead bottle then grabbed yawn by the collar of his tunic and let siren climb up on his back yeah i will figure out something for them to do he grumbled as he started to walk out of the village yawn flailed his arms madly and yelled at the top of his lungs let me down you gonna meet da great woof ill bet you siren was just glad to be with her dad were going to the outpost out to the out post we go she sang as she played with stanricks helmet he scanned the pines looking for pineed sap as he went ok you two lets play a game who can get me the most sap siren jumped down and took off in to the trees yawn pumped his feet and stanrick looked at him in amusement as he let him down and the two ran tree to tree picking up sap remember how i taught you to pick it its no good if you damage it he yelled with a smile as he pulled out his pipe and lit it taking a drag before he started to take the walk to the out post he passed two warriors heading back to the village and they nodded to stanrick normally he would not let his younger siblings run loose in the pineed forest near the village but this time of the year the harvest was in full swing the entire woods was filled with hunters and warriors and they would be safe after stanrick had returned from fighting humans he was appointed as the quartermaster of the outpost he still thought he was a little young for the posting but he knew better then to question his great aunt if she picked him then she had a reason but he was starting to wonder if something was going on this was the third time this month he had talked to soulvieg but he did not ever recall walking in to her great hall every time she asked about dreams but he could not recall any the thought was gone as he walked into the outpost and he climbed up the ladder and joined his younger brother ranmir and looked out at the swamp ranmir was just about a year younger then stanrick the two brothers watched the kids playing in the field with the wooden swords hunters walked back from the trails as other warriors began their patrols stanrick do you ever wonder if the mordok believe in gaia and the great wolf like we do i mean if we travel to the heart of the swamp do you think they burn their dead and sing their praises stanrick look at his brother and tried to see where this came from what youre kidding right ranmir headed for the ladder and started down no brother i mean it the world as we have been raised to see it has changed as children we never knew of a world past the endless sea yet humans and syndar have come to our lands telling stories of the dead walking no ulven has gone on the long walk and returned maybe they had fallen or maybe they found a place to live in peace we will never know unless we look he went down the ladder and went to grab his bag by the fire daddy daddy yelled siren from outside the wall stanrick turned to look at his little girl yes he asked her she looked up and stuck out her tongue and made a strange sound bulipliplip he smiled down at her and stuck out his tongue in return bulipliplip in the corner of his eye he saw ranmir walking out the outpost heading north so youre going then did you tell mother ranmir stopped and turned to look up at stanrick she knows as does soulvieg i have to do this stanrick this is the path gaia has put to my feet i dont know what i will find but i know we will meet again with that ranmir continued to walk as the moon rose in the east and soon the sight of him was lost in the trees siren and yawn climbed up to the look out and joined stanrick she pulled on stanricks tunic daddy where is uncle ranmir going he looked at the tree line i dont know but i believe we will see him againpack goldmane aesaleif goldmane toyed idly with a bit of partially carved wood she was supposed to be on watch but with all the ulven activity in the area recently there had been no mordok to be seen for miles around her own pack had been marching up and down their territory for months skirmishing with the incomers though they hadnt had word from them since news of the treaty had come a few days past she couldnt wait for them to settle with the incomers so she could get her turn to look at them she had heard that some of them had pointed ears like the mordok and wore strange clothing her mate valgeir had promised to bring her back some trinkets if he could a party of graytide had come through a day or two before she didnt know most of them except for khulgar he had taken valds as his mate and had come looking for her and their lively little daughter valdis had been visiting home when news of the treaty came through and she just had to go with the pack to see the incomers in person movement in the tree line alerted her and she drew herself up ready to sound the alarm in an instant but the figures coming slowly out of the shadows were familiar the graytide party she looked eagerly for her mate or any of her pack but was disappointed still all talking with the incomers no doubtshe thought to herself the others and her would be glad for news though she thought as she shouted a hearty greeting she leapt down from her post calling to the others that remained there and they soon had gathered by the gates eager to speak with the dour graytide warriors but the graytide had not met them at the gate they waited at some distance away lycon conferring with khulgar everyone around the gate fell quiet and the eldest among them stepped forward and greeted the graytides again this time far more somberly lycon did not return the greeting but khulgar walked towards them why khulgar instead of lycon because he took a goldmane as a mateher mind fretted and fear blossomed inside her as he drew closer they could all see something in his red eyes he halted before them and the pack was as silent as death do you bring news of our warriors the eldest asked in a trembling voice yes said khulgar hollowly they are dead all of them the graytide escorted them to the bodies of their pack laid out carefully in the snow she found her father and her mate her tear blurred eyes barely able to take in their wounds the sounds of her packmates keening filled her ears and her world became only grief sorrow wails and blood on the snow the graytide offered to help them build the funeral pyres but they shrugged them off allowing only khulgar to carry wood for their dead everyone though honored them and the trees resounded with their howls of grief and the tales of their loved ones before she gave him to the fires she carefully removed a necklace from her mates torn throat she had made it for him to mark their first year together his blood stained the sunburst she had carved painstakingly into the stone and the image of him laid out in the snow burned itself into her heart she wept then she wept as she never had before and she vowed as she never would again they greeted the dawn wearily and painfully discovering that sometime in the night the graytide had left them some of the survivors guessed at their purpose and grimly nodded satisfaction they left to go back home one last time spreading the ashes of their mates fathers mothers sons and daughters as they went it was three days later when the graytide party returned some of them now sporting new trophies from their sword belts by that time most of the remaining goldmane had left going to what kin they had left to them aesaleif otama and another male were the only adults left and khulgars little girl they gave over the little girl to her father her confused wails painting the theme of the past few broken days it was an ambush stated on of the warriors emotionless the outsiders did not know of the treaty yet when your pack went to greet them they slaughtered them all did you pay them back hissed the male goldmane did you kill them we made them pay but it was not enough seethed lycon hissing in pain and anger as one of the warriors treated his sluggishly bleeding stump his tunic was stained with blood and all could see how much the loss of his arm pained him they had no daughter among them to heal it the longfang interfered they chose to uphold the treaty and protected the outsiders the goldmane nodded it was more revenge than they could have mustered alone it would have to do for now the packs stared at each other for long moment each unsure what was to be done now the goldmane were broken beyond repair they had no where to go come with us said lycon grimly there is nothing for you here now our home is yours and perhaps we may take revenge together for those lost to us the remaining goldmane shared only a brief look among them before taking the proffered arm and the promise of vengeancestanrick longfang harlok longfang two months had passed two months of marching sleeping in the wild and fighting since kragen bloodmoon had come to onsallas outpost and requested that pack longfang send aid to fight off a new invader from the sea stanrick was only twenty six but he had killed many mordok in his life he had been eager to join this fight and didnt care who else was going to answer the call and what of the mordok what of the swamp kragen do you mean to take every warrior from us to fight some invaders that are your problem asked norgoth norgoth had only seen twenty three summers and although he was a member of pack longfang he was not from the family longfang why should we risk our lives for them he now directed his words to his pack one of the young graytide warriors who was traveling with kragen stepped forward can you not see that this threat will not stop with just one pack do you really believe that they wont come north and invade your village you as a longfang should understand that this is a threat to all ulven norgoth was about to give his reply with his mace but stanrick spoke up first ekaj shadowmane is right if what kragen bloodmoon has said about these people from the sea is true then we should help norgoth was alone in his feelings and dennagrath approached kragen and clasped his forearm kragen bloodmoon i believe i speak for all longfang warriors in saying that we will go with you for we know that a threat to one is a threat to all with that the longfangs marched to fight singing the songs of old the sword is sharp the spear is long the arrow swift the gate is strong the heart is bold the spirit old the ulven warriors have returned farewell we call to hearth and hall though wind may blow and rain may fall we must away ere break of day far over the wood and mountain tall the great wolf watches from on high gaia guides us in the night our names will ring and spirits sing if our bodies in battle fall but it wasnt as easy of a task as the ulven thought this would be the invaders were nothing like the mordok humans and syndar strange looking people and very well organized the humans looked like ulven without fangs and no change in their eye and reminded stanrick of a pup who had changed late the syndar were stranger still their ears made points and skin of such strange colors but the oddest part of the invaders was how they fought the mordok used hit and run tactics raiding villages and traders and the ulven used hunting parties to raid the loosely organized groups of mordok but humans had heavy armor and worked closely together the syndar used magic in battle even the males but the ulven had worked like a wolf pack picking off any who had been foolish enough to break their lines winter was coming and the night air was chilled and this night was like every night since kragen convinced stanrick to leave his daughter and the rest of onsallas village behind harlok held up three fingers on his right hand while fluttering up his fingers of his left under them three more for the pyre asked stanrick harlok nodded as he helped wrap a fallen warrior in linens and place him on the stack of logs as was tradition stories of the fallen were told and their spirits sent to the great wolf the pyres burned so bright that the humans camps saw them from miles away stanrick looked around the camp and he saw members of almost every local pack he could think of we have more warriors in this one war party then i have seen in any one place he said as he lit his pipe the war pack was ready in a few weeks but not all the locals are warriors they are slow and dont know how to fight sneered ekaj who had been playing with the syndar ears he had hanging from his neck that is gross said mena long fang the goldmanes love it ekaj grinned mena had not always been a longfang but joined after she had chosen stanrick as a mate she had been accepted in to the pack as a warrior and proven herself time and again but now she did her best to hide the fact she missed her daughter im going to sleep you can play with your trophies she said and went into her tent whats her problem ekaj asked stanrick youre keeping trophies some packs tend to be more upset over that then others should have heard her the night harlok brought home a mordok scalp replied stanrick harlok looked up from his mead and grinned you young warriors should get some rest our scouts report that the humans will be passing through the clearing in the valley to meet up with a larger group kragen wants to hit them while they move said dennagrath stanrick put out the pipe and joined mena in their tent am i weak stanrick she asked in a whisper as he lay next to her he could tell she was crying why would you say that he asked as he put his arms around his mate im afraid im supposed to be a longfang warrior and i froze in battle today all i could think of was what if we all fall who would protect siren and yawn if it wasnt for vilkas giving his life i would have been on the pyre mena fear not if we fall gaia will give our village the strength to go on and we will be with the great wolf with that he kissed her forehead and the two drifted to sleep the ulven had awakened before the sun horse had started his runand had packed up and moved to the forest edge of the valley the fog was so thick that you could not see ten feet away but that was not needed because they could hear the humans marching keep moving and stay in formation a voice in the fog yelled stanrick aimed his bow and waited for the signal kragen let out a howl and the archers loosed arrows in the direction of the marching humans shields up box formation left flank from what stanrick knew of humans this meant that they were now facing the woods in a tight formation shields high to protect from arrows the archers let off two more volleys then pulled out melee weapons to charge the human line the war cries of the ulven started low then rose up like thunder a flood of steel leather and fangs came from the tree line to smash upon the rock like human line the fog began clear out of the valley just enough that stanrick could see the lines of shield men protect the women and children keep the line yelled a man was sitting on top of a horse the ulven had never seen a horse big enough to ride this beast was large enough to hold a man that must have been over 6 feet tall on foot covered from head to toe in steel there must have been at least thirty humans about half that of the war pack soon he too had smashed upon the wall of steel hacking slashing and stabbing at any opening he could find you have fought the undead and lived these ulven do not rise from the grave let yourahhh the man fell from his horse as dennagrath pulled him down his fangs exposed he let out a victorious howl as he stood over the fallen leader of men some had broken off to run but most of the line held good i am tired of their stupid ghost stories growled ekaj as he cut down one of the fleeing men stanrick focused on the task at hand his shield was shattered but he pushed on to break the humans line he no longer knew how many had fallen to his blade when he heard a scream of rage and his heart sunk he looked back but all he could see were humans and syndar mena had thrown away her shield and began to hack at the humans in her way screaming like a banshee of legend stanrick fought to get to her to be by her side but she lost momentum and fell to her knees before a man with a two handed sword he tried to yell out to her but it was too late the human took off her head in one fell swoop the human spit at menas body and called her a bitch rage filled stanricks blood and he charged the man who was about a foot taller than him the man turned to face him grinning but not for long stanrick had slashed him in the leg and he collapsed to the blood covered grass no please dont kill me he cried out but his plea fell on deaf ears and stanrick finished him as quickly as he could he was so struck with grief he did not see the other longfangs still fighting the humans that were trying to protect their young the battlefield was no place for children ulven learn to fight at an early age and even killed mordok as early as four years of age but this was with older pack members near home against a foolish mordok that had been scouting too close to a village to bring the young to a battle like this though made no sense harlok had just plunged his spear into a human that was trying to sneak up behind stanrick harlok showed his fangs in anger if he still had his tongue he would have been yelling about how stupid stanrick was as he pulled him up off his knees only then seeing menas lifeless form he frowned then made a gesture of words going up to the great wolf stanrick nodded yes her name will ring the fighting had moved away to the other side of the clearing as the humans and syndar now tried to make their way to the road to escape to their camps stanrick and harlok ran to meet with the rest but they were few in number stanrick looked around for other ulven warriors kragen was finishing off the last of the humans that had been in his way and ekaj was cutting off a humans finger a few others had been fighting with a few footmen that had stood their ground to protect their comrades then he saw his father cut down a heavily armored man dennagrath made sure he was dead and made way back to the rest then it was as if time had stopped he looked into his fathers eyes drake green lupine eyes he had seen this before in a nightmare he knew what was happening and could not stop it from the mist a syndar arrow pierced dennagrath then another and third the life drained out of his eyes and dennagrath longfang warrior of pack longfang fell to the ground stanrick didnt remember the end of the battle ekaj and a few others from clan grimward gave chase to the humans and returned with the heads of several humans the warriors that remained had gathered the dead ulven human and syndar we burn them all the invaders in that pile put our brothers and sisters on the pyre tonight we will tell stories and the names of our fallen will ring in his ears shouted kragen harlok mended stanricks wounds as he smoked his pipe we are the only longfang to survive the battle asked stanrick harlok paused and nodded he held up six fingers we lost six in that battle harlok nodded again then ripped the bandage with his teeth they got up and walked to the pyres stanrick thinking of stories to tell so the great wolf would hear their deedsviews seen by most recent pack chieftain darvrick icewolf as written in his journal 1012 years ago what can i say about the icewolves we are hunters of day and night we are known for many things compassion well thats a different story only for our young i hope someday salguod finds this journal so that he may know that he was important not only to his mother but to me as well but i am to talk about the pack a few months ago i was approached by one of our eldest witches she told me of a mordok attack that would weaken us to our core and most would not survive she told me only the strongest would survive she told me there would be a strong evil force that has never been seen before by our kind she said that no one would listen or aid us but there was hope she also told me of a betrayal that will happen years from now by our clan to some of our friends then she told me of a civil war she continued to tell me of things but the rest all seemed like babble to me of course out of respect i let her continue then i ask is there a way around this with minimal casualties there was a glint in her eye almost as if she was waiting for me to ask she says there is a way do not contact any of the other packs or clans talk with the heads of the families and get cooperation to make plans to have them disappear during the attack have a strong fighting force to oppose the attack i will arrive later and let you know the icewolves are known to be courageous and to be feared by our enemies we are warriors and hunters some are archers and farmers what to do listen to the old hag or have our great pack extinguished overnight as for salguod he is the next in line to be chieftain he is already respected on his own even some of my advisers are in favor of him to be chieftain as for a clan betrayal in years to come civil war she has to be crazy he is my son i cannot bear to lose him there will be danger for all i will send him away on a hunt or something he must live for i might not so i spent the next couple of days with the heads of the families in secret meetings to explain what the old witch said and we devised a plan for the pack to disperse among the packs and clans of their choosing i told them not to introduce themselves as icewolves and to avoid our clan the whiteoak there was much doubt and confusion but i made them listen i told them to wait until the time was right when salguod was ready to take on the chieftain role he should look for any remaining icewolves to back his cause even though he may think the pack is gone he will still believe that there will be few left out of the seven families there has to be some left gaia and salguod forgive me for what i must do to protect youyear 250 just outside of the newhope colony we are going to freeze to death before you fix that said brynor he tried to bundle his cloak more tightly around himself the snow was assaulting the travelers in sheets brynors hands were frozen to the point where he no longer had the dexterity to pull a drawstring nor gather up the hem of his cloak his futile attempt at stopping the cold made him look all the more miserable after all weve been through and after we have come so far we are going to freeze he muttered through clenched teeth no we arent we just need to get the wagon wheel fixed and well be back to newhope by sundown said norel brynors brother squinting and stopping to brush the snow off his face as he pried the broken wheel off the wagons frame but you have to agree that we are cursed with a run of bad luck said brynor we spent almost all of our money to pay for a spot on the boat to leave aldoria we braved the winds and the waves of the ocean only to finally arrive on mardrun in the heart of a blizzard and now here we are on the side of the road with a broken wheel and our only form of income being the hope of selling a load of supplies that are stuck in the snow said brynor as he stood there uselessly watching norel struggle with the wheel why dont you shut up and actually make yourself useful and help me fix this damn wheel youre just standing there like an oaf snapped norel quiet both of you hissed gainen their escort and the closest thing to a bodyguard that they had gainen had been hired to tag along with the two brothers for a cut of their sales once they arrived at newhope he was no professional mercenary or soldier but he was handy with a sword like many of the refugees from faedrun he was lucky to have arrived with the coat on his back brynor opened his mouth to say something but fell silent as gainens blade cleared its scabbard judging by his posture and intense focus on the road in front of him something was out there just out of sight obscured in the thick falling snow for what seemed like an eternity all three of them stood completely still nothing came into view and the only noise was the howling of the wind the wind died down and the world was silent save the gentle patter of falling snow no one moved each man held his breath through the snow came the distinct creak of a drawn bow and the whistling release of an arrow gainen recognized the noise and tried to duck out of the way but he was too late the arrow sunk almost fletching deep below his left hip punching through the long leather jerkin he wore beneath his cloak with a startled cry gainen collapsed to the ground on the path he struggled to rise but a second arrow snapped through the air and buried itself deep into his right thigh gritting his teeth gainen tried to claw his way back to the wagon while still clutching his sword out in front of him in a feeble attempt to shield himself brynor and norel stood dumbfounded with terror unable to move as the events unfolded in front of them the dark shapes of three mordok emerged from the path and stepped close enough to be seen through the driving snow with their hideous bestial faces filthy rags and blood caked furs they seemed to melt forth from the whirling whiteout like monsters out of a nightmare their crude armor was adorned with trinkets and trophies one of them had a severed human hand nailed to its shield the world was silent save the falling snow and the ragged breath of gainen as he lie bleeding in the snow two of the skulking forms moved quickly towards the wounded guard to take advantage of his crippled state and the third mordok knocked another arrow the archer took its time pulled back the bow and sighted in on brynor finally snapping out of his stupor the merchant back peddled and tried to run hed complained about freezing before but that now he really was about to die that whole tiff with his brother seemed rather juvenile the mordok archer suddenly jolted to the side as a thrown javelin sank into its shoulder the impact jarred its hands and the arrow whistled out of the bow wildly off target before the archer had time to recover another dark shape moved in close steel flashed against the whiteness and an axe head buried itself haft deep into the sternum of the mordok the sickening crunch of its rib cage collapsing echoed through the stillness the mordok archer let out a rattling cry that ended in a wet gurgle as hot steaming blood gushed from its thorasic cavity and into its upper airway the monsters fall was muffled by the deep snow the axe wielder stepped on the corpse and rocked the head of his weapon free of the mordoks chest with a wet crunch the two remaining mordok roared and turned to meet the new threat as they charged in the dark shape moved to meet them and was now visible clad in brown armor a full helm mail of steel and furs he carried a shield with white tribal markings on it from behind the figure came several more dark shapes in armor and the two sides crashed head on axes and swords flashed through the air cleaving into armor furs and the flesh of both sides spear tips darted out at range one of the armor clad figures pushed a mordok to the ground and slit its throat with a dagger but not before the mordok used a wicked looking knife to slice his opponents arm open another mordok was taken apart by numerous strikes and a stab to the stomach it slowly slumped to the ground as the spear was twisted free the encounter was quick bloody and brutally quiet but all three mordok were dead still awestruck by the violence they had just witnessed brynor and norel could do nothing but stare these strangers these warriors had come to their rescue and saved them from a horrible fate at the hands of the mordok monsters that eat the flesh of the living and boil the people they kill down to bones brynor who had taken up a hiding spot behind the wagon with norel after the archers shot missed smiled and ran forward to greet their saviors praise the gods i cant believe it you saved our lives i cant thank you enough for brynor no get back yelled gainen through gritted teeth still on the ground holding his wounded legs as blood pooled in the snow beneath him it wasnt gainens warning that made brynor stop dead in his tracks it was what he saw when he got close enough to the figure clad in the blood spattered armor instead of the newhope guard that brynor had expected a man with piercing yellow eyes stood before him the intensity of those eyes chilled brynor far more than the snow and freezing wind that whipped his cloak around him the mans lips curled back to show enlarged and feral canine fangs not a single word was spoken but brynor felt as if the man before him were sizing him up and was debating on how he wanted to kill him they would all die here on the path ripped limb from limb by those who could kill even the monstrous mordok brynor held his breath and waited for his fate to be decided after what seemed like an eternity the armor clad figure grunted a signal to those behind him and pushed passed brynor there were eight other warriors total both male and female four of them pulled on a rope connected to two makeshift sleds formed from tree branches on each sled lay the motionless shape of a warrior their flesh was pale and the snow that fell upon their faces did not melt one of the walking warriors who was not dragging a corpse a female archer with a wounded arm walked close to gainen dropped a couple bandages near him and continued to walk on the warriors continued along the path until the driving snow seemed to consume them with renewed vigor norel fixed the wagon brynor helped apply the bandages to gainens legs and moved him into the back of the cart where he passed out from pain and blood loss he was in bad shape but if they could find a healer soon he might live darkness was setting in they pushed the cart on the trail with haste and continued towards newhope the bodies of the mordok already beginning to be covered by the falling snow they continued on for almost a mile before either one of them spoke who what were those said brynor meekly finally breaking the silence i dont know the guards at the port told us about the mordok but nobody said anything else i heard rumors of another colony here on mardrun but those things they werent human did you see their eyes their fangs i would never believe it unless i saw it tonight here with you but those warriors were said norel who paused as their wagon wheel hit an unexpected bump in the center of the road and jolted to a stop the wheel had hit the side of a mound in their path as norel and brynor looked down to see what it was they noticed that there were more mounds in the road uneven lumps in the snow scattered about human shaped lumps on the trail before them were ten bodies almost completely covered in snow the wheel of the cart had brushed the snow off of the closest corpse revealing a human in bloody armor and a tabard the insignia on the corpse was that of the guards of newhope demons finished norel with a broken and shaky voice brynor and norel dislodged the cart from the corpse and ran as fast as they could towards the gates of newhopestanrick longfang     dennagrath looked out over the hill looking down at the outpost for the last 7 years he had made his home with the longfangs and proven time and time again to be a warrior worthy of the name he had left his old home and pack so he could help raise his 6yearold son and too be with his mate he was old now almost 60 yet the fire never left his eyes in his old pack he was a craftsman and carpenter before joined his chieftain to venture to the dirge swamp they stayed at the outpost and that was where he met yoredon longfang his skills had gained her attention when he returned from the swamp with a longfang hunting party if he would have passed away that night the great wolf would know his name but what made her pick him was his skills with a knife for 2 weeks he carefully made figures for her out of wood the last on was a male and female ulven with a pup as she studied them by fire light she saw it was her self and him 7 mouths later she had her pup a boy nonthe less dennagrath joined the pack and became a full longfang he smiled at the outpost happy to have it be his home then turned to look at his son stanrick its dead you will break the mace if you keep hitting it like that the 6 year old pup had 4 notches on the mace handle and this mordok would make it 5 but with the first 4 his father never saw the fear that young stanrick had in his eyes whats wrong pup he asked picking him up and holding him close what if it gets back up i want it t stay dead dennagrath tilted his head and looked closely at the deformed mordok i dont think hes getting up you killed him dead stanrick grabbed tight not wanting to look at the body it did in my dream i was big and strong and so was little harlok we killed an army of mordok in the night with others by our sides but they got back up and we killed them again i had a little brother and mommy died but you werent there and some green person fighting with us we killed them over and over but they got up again he stopped talking to take a breath dennagrath laughed that is quite a dream a green person you say was he an ulven or mordok stanrick push away and jumped down turned to the bloody pile of mordok and gave it a kick she was not a mordok or a ulven his father laughed again ok ok i understand lets burn this mordok and head home ok like i always say fire fixes everything stanrick ran around getting sticks and brush and making a pier for the mordok the pup took his flint and hit it with a knife starting the fire as the flames consumed the body stanrick pulled at his fathers pant leg daddy why do we burn the mordok we dont honor them as fallen warriors do we dennagrath tussled the pups hair no pup but see the ash from the death gaia will bring life trees will grow here tall and strong if we let it rot it his blood will kill the trees stanrick watched the flames as he cut a new notch in his mace the sun set and as the fire died off the little ulven drifted to sleep his father picked him up and took him home sleep well pup the dead do not walksyrus marks of old world background and history chapter 1 how it all began as written from acolyte syrus marks of the rouges monastery all right all right by the gods of light and virtue i shall record this need not for the poking prodding injuring and miracles witnessed by all while the corrupting forces of evil would just charge a daemon to write the pages that fall from the soul i syrus marks follower of the rouge cleric monastery do hereby write this by my own hand so if you see a spelling error mind you its the illiteracy of my own doing not the sprites or acolytes that the gods humbly bless me with where to begin and i say again where to begin a little information before all this began that should help get the thoughts rolling when i was a wee lad that i found myself blessed with the gift of divinity i was or still am gifted in the ways of clerical magics i as a boy was able to cast some of the most simple of miracles i could cure the scrapes on the kids so they dont get in trouble with mum a quick barrier to absorb the impact of the fall when descending a great distance    its called falling ah but i boast least to fix that before the benevolent gods find disfavor with me and strip my cleric abilitys from me this of course had me in front of churches and cathedrals a like marveled in awe of the abilitys bestowed on me as if i were a creature i knew not of what i did just be born why would the gods want to bless a boy that would later become a man that will spend his life picking up the fragments of his own life thrust himself into danger with no care for his own life mayhap one day that i fear is soon will i learn the veiled secrets of the gods unfortunately with all this new found fame i was not prepared for it it went to my head as i grew in years i could fill a book with the perverse things you could do with this ability i shall instead hold my hand and mind and not release that beast least it be a plague upon all the good of learning for the divine the gods know there are already horrors to be held at our front door best to hold the ones that live in our dreams in the world they reside at least then we can defeat them with hope imagination and blessings rather than spell sword or banishment in these dark times of whoring drunkenness and downright filthy begging hell i was a youth filled boy what did you expect it seemed as if the only way on how i could bring myself out of this hole would to off myself or put myself into bondage as a servant of the dark ones on one drunken and blurry night i was stumbling through the streets of a town i was passing through looking for loose gold on the ground and perhaps an abandon house i can pass out in at least a dry gutter it was late on that summer night the moon had passed the high point of its travel and was descending back to the horizon abruptly a door slammed against the cobblestone wall a male and female voice echoed the male angered and demanding the female voice sounding panicked need i detail this anymore filled with some righteous fury that boiled in my heart i was drawn to the danger like a moth to flame just as i passed a building i got a clear view not only was it two males but it was a very weak looking female this boiled the wrath into anger grabbing a loose but hard stick from a garbage pile in the street i snuck up on the two and cracked the stick over one of the scums head with that opportunity the woman kicked the other guy square in the family jewels then plowed her knee into his skull this put the vagrant into a stunned state and the confrontation was over in those two hits now at a closer inspection the woman was not weak at all she was quite tone as if to hint at being a warrior of some kind i thank you for your help least it be of fatigue to you milord i cracked a grin no lords here milady just syrus and glad to be of your help i bowed and nearly lost what meager food i had left and showing obvious intoxication an unstable one you be come into the confines of the pub this night only be trouble let the night watch pick up that rabble she led me into the building that was a full bar but took me to a secret spot in the wall and descended into a basement that was very cozy my good lady i dont mean to insult but  are you a  just an adventure and judging by your looks youre going to need help where ever you can find it syrus not all good is wrapped in light and not all evil in blood what did i stumble into servitude syrus youll learn all i remember was her smile and then little to no memory after that the next few years was filled with work in servitude of others we would find the weak and defend them find the poor and uplift them i did not realize it at the time but i was learning through practice the virtues of the codes of chivalry none the less through a woman perhaps the gods realized i pay more attention to a female teacher then a male one or perhaps it was to insult me as to where i was thinking none the less i could write a whole separate book upon these adventures perhaps in time i may if the gods let me grow old and grey needless to say these years changed my life from a drunken man whore to an upright defender this lasted until a day fate intervened i had grown the strength in my back to lift my own weight and to carry on the teachings of what i had learned it did not prepare me for that night while scouring the country side we found a fair in size deserted camp signs of struggle dead bodies and broken weapons were everywhere the place reeked of death must have been 50 men or more upon inspecting the camp very little was left to salvage the blood stained the ground armor and was like a crusty jelly on all the weapons armor was pierced hacked or otherwise destroyed giving no protection to anyone that would want to wear it when we got to the middle of the camp thats when the rattling and clanging of metal and the stretching of leather erupted like a slow rumble the bodies we were previously inspecting were getting up this was  impossible things that are dead remain dead not reanimate thinking we knew better than a few lumbering corpses we tried to attack and hack the monstrositys to oblivion that did not work the ones we thought we killed because they hit the ground when we split the skull open rose back up to come back for some more we tried to dismember the bodies hewing bone and sinew yet the limbs would try to crawl with whatever power they had towards us it was clear now we needed to retreat least we become like whatever foul plague these things were this is that time where you wish you could strip your armor off because if youre caught even if you have it it will not save you we crested a small grassy hill that lead to a nearby town and thinking we would be safe that is when our nightmare struck the town was on fire the plumes of smoke blanketed the night sky blocking out the stars and moon we now had no safe place to be the lumbering corpses that were behind us and the evil fire in front of us only death seemed to be the closest stronghold this is your final lesson acolyte die with honor among the ones without no she shook her head sacrifice its clear  she cut me off silence your tongue or you wont live to use it take this she thrust a rock which looked like a large sapphire into my hand hold onto this and think of a place you want to be my mind swirled with many other places i would rather be the one it focused on was a far off place with thick walls and a team of gallant warriors ready at all times to defeat the evil in the immediate area now harness that image concentrate  and dont open your eyes she began some chanting my minds eye seem to fixate on this image i had in my head and seemed to be more like a reality popping out a book the more she chanted the chanting fell to a murmur as if she was walking away and then the glow of the distant fire dyed and the rot of death dissipated i did what i may not have had to do and open my eyes in shock i was not where i was before mmaster i called out in a shaky voice calling again and again but all that responded was the chirping birds and the small critters that were startled that someone was here i moved about the immediate area setting up a perimeter of where i was but before i could get into making markers i saw something in the sight distance through the somewhat dense forest that was not regular in this area a stone wall something like i dreamed up this must mean people and help with a little bit of haste i went to the wall only to find it dilapidated and falling apart no good for resisting even the creatures of the woods i began to investigate the ruins i had stumbled upon and found it to be a mighty stronghold at one point in its life must have been a few hundred possibly thousand years old and looked to be an amalgamation of both fey and human hands the tranquility was still there something the fey loved yet the hard work and back breaking construction was among it yet not a single soul was in this place ascending to the top of some of the towers of this stronghold husk showed nothing habitable in the immediate view i thought to myself if this is something of my own creation surely somone must be around i explored the complex with the remainder of the daylight bugs of light dotted the area it was hard to see but the moon providing just enough light to maneuver the ruins fortunately i learned the layout quick but very little was left of practical use using a few dirty and dusty linins fashioned a pillow sleeping on rock perhaps was not the best but it was the only form of bedding i had choice in the night was warm peaceful and relaxing despite the circumstances when i awoke immediately something had changed first my gear was gone second i was in something completely different robes thirdly the barracks i woke up in was populated with people fey and men it seemed that i was the first to wake the area was furnished nothing like the time worn husk i found a man walked in and with a commanding voice wake up his shout shocked everyone awake and the morning began men putting on their clothing and armor his gaze found me you he pointed here now scared i mustered the ability to move closer you are syrus i meekly responded back welcome his voice booming as if he was yelling yet not trying ready yourself he points to where i was sleeping and a wall adorned with new armor and weapons i put it on as best i could i was the last one out but still managed to follow the rest of the group the group fell into a formation in a large field when we finished walking the perimeter that is when the marching swordsmanship blocking and rigorously training took place for the next few days it was all i did there was no time left to explore this area i was in but it was just like the husk i left after a few days we were woken up the same fashion except this time the leader called my name syrus i moved to stand in front of him cleric training go he pointed out the door with a bit of haste i left my memory and some of the signs that were posted led me to the right room i came to a vibrant room clerics of both races and many backgrounds were here i spend the next few months cleansing my life essence of the evil i brought into it after a year or so i was finally purified to a point i could wield the familiar power of light with great confidence the people i learned from were mainly fey but had few humans we spent time in books trying to memorize spells and incantations quite a bit of time was spent learning how to use blessed items their properties and what to do when we cross one i was a little different they said i was fey blooded apparently instead of memorizing spells from a book like the other common men had to do i could spontaneously cast them with little to no effort in fact memorizing was hurting my ability to cast my stay with the clerics was long yet felt short in the rear view of it all before i left the cleric leaders spoke some words on me and inscribed some magical runes that bore into my skin they said only the ones attuned to magic will know what is in me it will be a spirit to guide me in further growth of my potential i went to bed that night and came back to the place that i was when i lost my original master as if i had never moved the place was much brighter and did not smell of death the town that was burned was built back up a large barn was constructed and a few other buildings i ventured forth to see what had been taking place in the obvious years i was gone this is where i met a good friend ayaton he spent time in the military and was actually enlisted at this point i was picked up as a mercenary with my cleric abilitys and we also met damion an assassin of sorts my tenure with that regiment did not last long there was a night that descended upon us the leader of this army became corrupt and i had to banish his life essence into the nether it came from after being subdued by any that didnt follow the leaders madness we learned about this late one night he brought damion up on false charges of assassination damion may be a bit misunderstood but he is doing what he does best looking out for number one he may defy orders but he wont out right kill someone a fight erupted in the commanders camp one night ayaton and i got our arms readied and helped damion flee the scene damion must have used one of his poisoned daggers to kill the commander i remember him shouting at us as we booked out of the camp on horseback kill them and bring their heads back so we may mount them on pikes for the dark ones the rest of the group that was true to the ways of good and right must have ended their uprising because we made it out of that night alive with no traitors at our feet after that the three of us became specialist force with that we were allowed to act on our own ayaton got married damion left to fight battles to put coin in his pocket and i left to do what i normally did banish and purge the evil in the land it was only a few quick years that i found myself back to the same place rumors of the dead walking again and this time being organized ready to destroy all that came across the area a cattle call of arms was put out the 12th company was on its way but the army would not get there in time it was anticipated the undead horde would descend upon the township they needed strong able bodied adventurers to come and secure the area hold it until the army showed that began the next few scary nights i had i knew i was not going to get paid enough to deal with all this but duty calls end chapter 1 chapter 2 night of eternal shadows 2011 last hope old world event as perceived by brother syrus marks cleric of the rouges monastery by the grace of light i shall make it out alive these days its the only thing right to do i headed into the massive pub they had windbags inn and tavern luck would have it i ran into ayaton after all we were keeping a low profile i thought we would only meet each other in an afterlife hail ayaton i called to him letting my hood obscure my face who are you i stood upright so he could see me and put down my hood so he could see my face syrus its you how have you been ya old dog i havent seen you since another voice interrupted low and callous since our freedom ayaton looked a little shocked by who would have the nerve to cut him off then realizing who the dark figure was that maneuvered around our back sides damion    wow perhaps this is a good day yes it is i replied ive been good i hope things have been going well for you as well ayaton brightened up yes things have been good and well you know how we must start things out correct before i could answer ayaton he punched me across the face and i stumbled backwards trying to regain myself from the sucker punch before i could i fell backwards over damion who was crouched behind me as i fell to the ground they erupted in laughter the only way we can greet one another ayaton said is by having a good brawl damion without missing a beat stands up and punches ayaton the chest within minutes we were wrestling one another the guard was alerted and rushed over but by that time we were laughing like kids in a play yard ill buy a beer for the winner one of the tavern maidens said with that damion made sure to knock us all to the ground in the next few seconds and claimed his free beer a few moments later ayation said while standing up and catching his breath hah nothing like a good ol brawl to get things going yes my good friend yes it is i replied we took to the confines of the windbag tavern for a while longer drinking singing and telling tales of our adventures everything was great until someone broke up the mood and stumbled into to the tavern causing quite a stir peasants who have given themselves over to the dark ones have chosen tonight to rise up a small penitent group is coming here we must stop them the one causing the commotion was a guard built for scouting little armor and arms on his person ill need all available people to get to the bottom of the hill they are going to be here soon without delay ayaton damion and i as well as a handful of other adventurers headed to the bottom of the hill and found ourselves met by a fairly small group of peasants that wore the mark of sold soul the mark is simple it consists of two lines one line under each eye in a vertical fashion as if they were crying black tears from each eye there must have been five or six the 10 of us that rallied three plus the other able bodied people that came could wipe them out our steel and armor verses their pitch forks and hand scythes we took to the high ground of the hill holding a line forcing the penitent to charge up the hill to get to us they set up a staggered line formation useful to reduce the effectiveness of arrows one of the penitents stepped forward we wish only to speak to you a robust bald penitent stepped forward as a wicked grin erupted on his face speak your words so and let us have peace one of the guards said tonight is the night of celebration the dark ones have come to celebrate with you for the small sacrifice of your life you may partake in this celebration with us let us convert you my soul is not mine to barter with for taking mine is asking the wrath of the gods i snapped back yet all the pawns are ultimately go back to the same box might as well have the fun no the confusing question got the better of the group as they focused on talking a hail of arrows came out from the nearby trees wounding a few of our group its a trap get these vermin slay them by the sword they want death give it to them various calls of our group shouted as a rally cry we charged into the group but unfortunately it was not as well as it could have been another volley of arrows went off wounding a few more with that we realized they had the tactical advantage against our numbers though we were better armed they were better placed someone called a retreat and oddly the penitent let us be we arrived back to the tavern to assess the wounded ayaton and damion could not be found when we pulled back to the tavern my flesh was still in one piece but my armor was another story thank the gods for a good blacksmith with no form of protection except for faith i went among the wounded and administered first aid and clerical aid to who i could throughout the night a few handful of penitent were killed some brought back questioned then executed no matter what we did how hard we fought or fear tactic we used the numbers kept coming that was the point we all realized it would be a long night the battle yells death cries and fighting soon faded and exhaustion finally hit our battle shocked bodies despite the looming fear of penitent jumping out of the woods erupting from the lake or sneaking into our tents and tavern sleep was easy to succumb to we rose with the sun as it came peering over the horizon some of us had less than adequate sleeping arrangements some slept on tables in the tavern corners some of us slept in the hedges or in trees the clanging hammer of the blacksmith reminded me i had some armor that needed repair when i got to him he already had a lot of steel to mend dropping it off was no problem as the benefit of the army they would eventually help this blacksmith by paying him back i wish sometimes i was skilled with a hammer and anvil more than magics then i could at least keep my armor in better shape for longer not all magic takes away the scars that a sword has left sometimes it will still leave scar tissue from the healing of limbs perhaps it is a way for the divines to remind you that you wont always be so lucky all the time we spent the morning breaking up into groups and scouting the area the majority of the patrols were taken by guardsmen we had word that a great commander was on his way commander caldrin if my memory serves either that or ill blame it on my bad hands for only remembering the c he was the victor of many battles and was the nearest to handle the threat here at least it gave us hope there were a few skirmishes that took place nothing noteworthy some injured a few killed on both sides of the fighting in between some of the skirmishes one of the scouting groups discovered a hovel across the lake near the tavern in addition some penitents were observed leaving the area it seemed to be a routine stop for them we sent up a search party and went across the lake to investigate upon getting across the lake we were ambushed by some penitent fortunately the divines favored us and the ambush failed i think their zeal over took their skill they practically fell upon our blades we proceeded across a small wooden bridge across a river then through some woods and found the small grotto we set up look outs and began investigating the grotto upon closer investigation it seemed to be more of a crypt than anything defiled pillaged and perhaps at one point contained weapons buried gold or trinkets was no longer here perhaps it was looted for trade reasons very few merchants stay where war is erupting yet that thought did not make sense they have the ability to just over take things by sheer numbers one thing that may shed some light on what or why the penitents were here may be contained in a book we found there unfortunately from those of us that could read it only came to determine it were ramblings of a crazy man unfortunately as some of us know crazy means something something to hide a much more sinister plot with whatever evidence we could carry we brought it with us unfortunately we spent too much time at the grotto some penitents were waiting for us just before we got back to the lake these ones must have had more training or were able to hone their zeal some of our group fell injured to the blades they wielded some were dead before we could help them after a hard fight we had to take the wounded dead and our evidence back to the town hopefully someone much wiser than the rest of us would be able to decrypt the book shortly after our return as if a beast was angered we found penitent mustering on the far side of the lake we could spare very few people but we had to fight we mustered what guardsmen we could and marched on to the field of battle with no taunts or bravado the lines met and combat ensued line after line of penitents washed upon our shield wall limbs screams cries and blood were showering everywhere if some dark god was watching he must have been smiling especially the way the penitent seemed to enjoy it cackling with glee and joy with what was left in their bodies giving praise as they died shouting im whole what were these crazy son of a village halfwit were these pig farming mud eating blunt weapon shakers think they are doing the mayhem continued for some time and just before the sun was about to hit the horizon and mark the time for dusk the penitents were in full retreat we pressed forward cut down the ones we could catch over one hundred and fifty penitents died that day our spirits swelled with hope from that fight and we lost only a handful one of the factors that made this such an overwhelming victory was the maidens from the tavern came down with supplies and extra arms to help the wounded as well as guard the flanks they did in fact with no armor and second rate weapons repel invaders that tried to out flank the line a song was written in their honor another factor that helped with our major success was due to the fact that we put aside all fault dismay and selfishness and helped one another we brought back wounded to the healers and tavern maidens who were renamed tavern valkyries i know for myself i fell to a grave wound many times but was helped back to the line by ayaton corpral tavin and even common foot soldiers the unification to live was stronger than the selfish calls to the grave the night started well a few cold drinks some warm food some smiling and happiness the patrols of guardsmen with a few volunteers were good enough to keep the semi frequent attacks of penitent away the night unfortunately was not able to end on a good note the moon was high in the sky when the horrors from my past would come to haunt me again undead invaded our perimeter unsure where they came from they have obviously been dead for a long time no distinguishable features or clothing nothing but rags and rotting flesh or bone the only fortunate thing about this is their were two or three but no matter what we did slice the skull off or open hack the limbs off these zombies were not like the ones i fought in my past they would regenerate sew themselves back together with some dark necromancy and start again we only had one other cleric with us and he could only make so many divine weapons it seemed to hold them at by for now but whatever ground we had we lost we soon retreated back to the windbag tavern where it was lucky we had a strange woman working tirelessly to draw runes the around the tavern that warded the area from undead to come in we were able to dispatch any of the corrupted peasants that were with them but those creatures those undead kept coming as we were in the inn like a bunch of scared cornered rats we found out that at the grotto there was a skull someone took it as a prize i dont know why they would want to do such a thing yet they took it anyway they tried to barter with the undead take the skull and leave us be i dont know about you but i am not sure the dead know on how to communicate i will admit while i dont remember what happened that night for some reason the undead left us i think their dark masters called them back or they got bored or maybe that other cleric blessed enough weapons that we banished them i wish i could tell you but none of us dared leave the tavern that night we had a few wounded a few killed but over all we did not lose that much in the way of man power at least nothing to the crippling degree we had in some of our early skirmishes the night dragged on even though we could take refuge in the safety of the tavern we still held patrols and watchmen to make sure we were not over taken by something that was not living or not friendly somehow we got sleep despite the overbearing fear but at least we recovered some of our strength morning came with egger anticipation scouting for food and preparations went slow it wouldnt have mattered some of us were still horrified from last night and did not have the ability to eat after we ate as if on cue we finally herd some trumpets blare and in the distant horizon as the sun was cresting the hill we could see the uniformed numbers of the 12th or was it the 7th ah the gods know what it was but ill keep with the 12th vandregon army company in tow with commander caldrin with them it was an inspiring site to behold when the rank and file finally came upon the small village we were at it was not a lie that we were already beat up damaged and possibly defeated with the arrival of the army now we could at least hold on to the hope that we were actually going to make it commander caldrin was soft spoken to say the least but his presence brought power to us all it felt like good spirits and celestial beings were among us by the gods if he were divinely inspired i would not take a bet to say otherwise with the hope of our lives making it past another day we could possibly turn this fight around not sure what we would do with the recently found undead in the penitent forces but we will win we spent the day making preparation for the final battle ahead it was obvious that the penitents in the area were dwindled in numbers and this was the last of their forces it was confirmed they are reinforced with a few undead perhaps with time they will decay die or fall apart i also herd one of the other clerics may have fashioned a weapon or device that may help as well the tricky thing with the dead is they dont tire they dont have a will to break nor can you intimidate them in addition with sufficient magic when one falls there will be another if not another two in its place i dont think whatever necromancer was controlling these beings was particularly powerful just the magic was very potent we knew that we could bless our weapons fortunately the other cleric that was with us could do that ayaton and corp tavin were charged with finding and destroying the creatures as they showed the rest of us were to keep them alive and destroy any penitent that would try to stop them the plan was simple destroy every last one of them the commander would be on the field of battle along sergeant graves his name escapes me but it was something like that ill call him that unless i can remember sergeant graves was the commander of the guard he was a grizzled vet with a bite to match his bark he wore the scars of his battles with pride it was said he served nearly 20 years he was rough tough and over all a very respectable man while he was on the front lines with us most of the battles he was usually busy elsewhere seeing to the preparation of his troops and readiness of the weapons i presume he was also seeing to the rights of the dead last thing we need was our own soldiers to crop up and start killing us from the tombs we put them in now with a final push we were able to join in the forces together and see to it that these dead were well dead we marched onto the field of battle and formed our line i wish you could have seen it the words i write wont tell you how great it was to see our men at arms take the field the penitents were waiting for us they crested the forest where all their witchcraft and heresy was coming from the remnants of their camp were strewn about as if some great fight had taken place one of them even stepped forward and offered a parlay after a few moments of consideration sergeant graves moved forward to meet the scum they had a few words back and forth what little i heard it was them pleading for us to see the light to come over and give our lives willingly to the dark ones not only did sergeant graves reject such an absurd notion he proceeded to punch as well as choke the poor beggar out both sides were stunned at what took place both graves and the diplomat and i use that word loosely wrestling and fighting after some rolling on the ground punches and verbal slander sergeant graves killed him with his own hands by snapping his neck with that the penitent responded by raising their banners and charging forward like a blacksmiths hammer pounding out the impurities of hot steel forging into what the smith would want sergeant graves got up shouted a rally cry and charged in not alone of course but with the backing of the vandregon army and guard we charged ahead splitting skull and shield alike we made some short work of the initial force but when the undead came in fear gripped the lines a few ran in terror a few others were braver and tried to fight i was one of them they seemed more concerned with killing then eating for when they impaled me upon one of their weapons they decided to leave me for dead fortunately the weapon missed some vitals and by the light i was able to get retrieved from the battle brought back and patched up i decided it was better to stay and help with the healing efforts we had our town healer and smith here patching up the most critical of the critical the rest were able to help keep the lines strong i helped as long as i was able to until both my medical supplies and my manna ran out i went cautiously back into the battle by this time i saw aiton and corporal tavin flank from our line and make a strike into the side of the defending forces one of the last things i remember before the battle closing was one of the penitent a slender female screaming like a banshee after she fell to the blessed blade of aiton the rest of the penitent were routed and fled i dont think any undead were left to retreat either the aftermath of the battle resulted in a bitter victory commander caldrin went missing apparently a smaller force of our men tried to go around the back of them and fight it was an elite unit they came after them and we gave them a fight him and his men were routed but gave the smaller force enough of a thrashing they couldnt peruse sergeant graves got bit by one of the undead we had little to no exposure to bites and scratches some of the rumors and ancient texts we recovered after sacking what was left of the camp was a description saying that he would turn into one of those monsters i think with the news of that he took off into the woods perhaps to find himself an honorable death perhaps to keep himself away from turning on other his reasons are his own mostly out of fatigue but equal parts respect they let him go bitter was the weather that day we may have saved the town but two influential and important people have gone missing lives are something that cannot be replaced damion as well crept off into the night one thing i learned from him is when he wants to be left alone he will find his alone time the cycle of life will continue in this area i dont know how long it will be but ayaton is forming the vandregon rangers our exploits with combined arms rather than our own separate adventures was noted at this point instead of being local individual heroes we decided to combine arms and find the more concentrated forces of evil with leave of the army we left to adventure the countryside and wilderness finding and rooting out evil where we could find it i think the time spent with ayatons rangers and my celestial buddies from the rouges monastery turned out to be what i needed to free the dark corruption inside myself i felt some of my healing potential come back with this i grew leaps and bounds in my healing abilitys i was only just an acolyte when i entered into the maw of the beast after it was slain i turned into a master of the arts my healing provided aitons rangers with more staying power and protection from the evils we faced i would not doubt we struck some fear back at them i hope so for those cave dwellers should feel something for the pain they caused maybe not i wont know any exposure i had with them was a happy bliss for causing death blood and destruction i dont know who holds these strings but if we were to figure a master mind behind it all and sever their existence from this plain perhaps we can bring peace back to this world again end chapter 2 chapter 3 unchained carnage last hope event 2012 as written from the perspective of syrus marks cleric of aitons rangers the next year progressed well enough at least for us i dont know about the rest of the vandergon army or any enemies they may have had with our constant adventuring it kept us as a hermit to the rest of the world we sent letters now and again letting the main forces know what we were up to we would occasionally check in at towns to see if anything was wrong or trouble was about to hit the town when we couldnt find outright evil to vanquish we would take jobs to pay the bills remove some ruffians at a tavern kill a few bandits on the road and my favorite exterminate some crazy black magic cultists so long as the job was paying we would take care of it might sound weird a group that is taking jobs on the side when they are in the employ of an army my thought is the more coin the better things do break that the army does not think will break and having some extra funding to keep our bellys fed supplies fresh and a few coins to get some extra information to keep from hurting someone is a great alternative its not like the army life is paying handsomely in the first place it was dreadful news we herd when we stopped to check in at one point we checked in at one of the way stations in the realm and a message was waiting for us big wax seal on it and written in elegant handwriting apparently there was some evil force reeking of death and destruction brewing back in old windbags tavern like a waves to rocks on the ocean memories we thought had been put behind us came rushing back the terror the screams of the wounded the horrid figures yet we are the best at what we do we are stronger now than what we were with steel magic and camaraderie we will be able to triumph over this task this time we were not so zealous or positive more like a veteran before battle we would know it will cost us something and that cost may be us upon our trip back to the dreaded land where the first events took place the conversations we had with the rest of the rangers were short and despite our attempts to make it sound like heroism we were not even close even the dullest fool was able to tell that what we witnessed there was nothing that one would want to recall to memory no bard would want to write a song about our deeds nor would anyone want to even come to the back to end of the world where we were going to and attempt to make things right more than enough blood was spilled and bodies burned those few nights we did not need to add to that number when we were within the outskirts of town it was dusk we set up our tents and headed into the small tavern to have ourselves a wind down drink from the journey some of the adventurers herd of the excitement up this way and decided to come and see what they could provide in assistance some of them looked green too green we sat down and had some introductions i do them a dishonor by not remembering their names but i think thats what their gravestones are for the first round got us all talking and into arm wrestling contests quite the pint of mead was passed around as we got into our second round of drinks we herd an awful shriek from outside someone was in dire terror like children wishing to play the adventurers and the rangers left the tavern to see what is going on there was an undead lumbering toward a townswoman the adventurers leapt into action and started attacking the creature after a few swings of their blades and a few bashes with the shield the undead fell just before they could do a victory dance the cursed thing got back up and nearly grabbed one of their legs with that we knew that even though it looked and smelled like an undead we were defiantly dealing with undead i went to work blessing blades for the destruction of the undead if you were wondering why i did not do this years before it was due to the fact i lacked the spell and the time to learn it just like the previous year ayaton went in for the killing blows and destroying the undead as the adventurers brought the undead to the ground our actions may have disturbed whatever dark forces are growing here what turned to be single undead here and there in the night ramped up to pairs then increased to triple i was barely able to rest long enough to keep the manna flowing to keep the blades blessed within time though the attacks suddenly and mysteriously stopped the next day i awoke to some hammering and general labor it was the 12th vandregon company with commander tevor if you did not know he was thought to be missing and possibly dead yet somehow made it back alive i had herd he was a cunning and tough guy as his story went when they finally broke from combat they had to flee in a very wide birth than normal they found places to camp but unfortunately the undead in those areas were far too many in number to safely settle eventually it took some time but they were able to get back to safety with his elite group and the remnants of the army that stayed behind to reinforce the area they were able to keep the area at peace unfortunately things recently have been too quite i hope this turns out to be a good decision typically when an enemy in the area turns inactive they have retreated the commander here did not think so he is sure they are planning something big i hope his hunch is right he has been at this far longer than i have i just dont want to be kept in an area that is already causing mental anguish as well as keeping me from coin paired with doing something good yet if this turns out to be right then ill have to be sure to stay alive or i wont be able to see the coin i have kept be used for good use either way my senseless bantering with myself wont make this any easier i even though we rangers dont need to follow command we are sworn to protect the weak im sure with the twelve of us here along with the armys rank and file in addition to the few individual adventurers that have shown up this should go better than what was initially expected it was best for us to scout the area we were set in a good spot the tavern was right on the crossroads and was fairly lit to the back end of the tavern and up the road was all camps with guards on routed patrols so nothing was going to come behind us to easily they were forced to either come up a hill to the tavern or wade across a lake a set of our scouts found a few penitents that were feeling brave they came to the hill down the way from the tavern they did not seem to be making haste to our location but were headed in our direction we rallied the nearby fighters and assembled a shield wall to defend the one point of access to the tavern almost as if we were in sync our shields formed a line a handful of penitent approached one of them stepped forward as a speaker as he stepped forward he rambled on about some nonsense a lot of the same stuff i heard before instead of in the cover of night this was during the day it was something i dont think i have seen before i know doomsayers when i see them yet this was far beyond that he was actually trying to convince us to give our life essence over to whatever dark god they worshiped ill admit the anger in my heart nearly over took my action while he was boasting we were reinforced by some of the vandregon army the reinforcements joined the rest of us in making a shield wall in a unifying one step forward we preceded one step at a time in this slow fashion until we could get in range to charge and exterminate the vermin i dont recall us taking any losses although i think a few of us were slightly wounded these penitents had nothing of value on them their weapons had no value no armor and nothing of worth in jewelry this would not be easy to make a profit off of pilfering the bodies looks like we will have to add them to a pyre see if we cant scare the ones that are alive to break and run i got a better look with who was in the fight i got to meet bucky stalwart and proud perhaps a little too proud for his own good corporal tavin level headed drunkard ive never seen someone drink as much as he does and still swing a claymore straight the next day there was also paladin artenen fighter zo and a few other people i decided it was best to separate from the rest of the rangers and find a spot in the tavern to look over some material that was found before we arrived a few journals and a few letters and notes one of them was the book we found in the grotto last year another was a letter about the captains whereabouts and orders another was a really strange journal the writer was obviously deranged and crazy he was either crazy or he was speaking so metaphorically that no one would be able to capture what he was talking about i spent a good hour on the journal but nothing came of it ayatons rangers were tasked with patrols and keeping the perimeter safe this is a little inferior to what we are used to but its what the captain wanted the good side i was thinking that he trusted our eyes a little more than the others out in the rank and file yet at the same time he was in opinion keeping his best troops in the most harm one of our scouting groups found the maykar they were a pair of priests that were able to do great acts of healing perhaps sent from the divines to help us in this god forsaken are with them in the ranks well behind the ranks we would be able to withstand an onslaught of what penitent could bring to us despite only being two people they were able to heal far more than anyone else could i tried to spend some time with them but they were recluse and not too chatty very driven to help not to teach or instruct we did have some good conversations about the healing arts if memory serves correctly one of our scouting groups witnessed a mass of penitent forming along an open field they were armed and obviously not looking to surrender their arms we had a bit of time to muster the forces before the battle happened we decided rather than use our assault group we were going to use the rank and file of the army although the assault forces were able to fell five or ten people they would fall eventually especially with some of the individual heros that were there we won a fairly decisive victory i personally stayed behind to help the maykar heal up the soldiers and valuable people that came back some did not make it past the battle but a majority did they did release some undead on the troops this was one of the few times i broke from my healing tasks to bless weapons or throw the wrath of the divine on them shattering them into dust not too much to write since i was not overseeing the fight or personally taking part the only time i did step onto the field of combat was at the end when they broke and ran back to the forest the rest of the daylight faded away we healed up who we could repaired armor restocked arms took a count of losses and said our goodbyes to the dead one of the scouting parties happened across a journal that perhaps pointed to the remains of a paladin of long ago burying an artifact with him at his grave this may give us the edge since paladins are the direct counter to undead if we harnessed this artifact then perhaps we will gain a solid victory over the penitent and perhaps drive them from the land i was egger to read the pages of that journal but alas i never got hold of it for when the captain looked at it they started drawing strategies and theorizing where it could be this is the time when he called ayaton and his handpicked group to arms to find it i wish we had more time because searching for the artifacts during the night was not going to go well i was a part of ayatons main force to go find the artifact we had a clue and that was it if memory serves correctly all that we had was where the trees and blood meet it took us a good hour to find the location when we did we found a ghost flanked with two other ghosts it spoke to us asking us questions and answering any question with a question it asked over all if we were to be worthy of this task just as if on cue some penitent ambushed us from the bushes and darkness a few of us fell to wounds but none of us came out dead seeing that the ghost of the paladin found us worthy and showed the location of his artifact the trees whispered ayatons name that night it was an odd yet refreshing breeze that frolicked in the trees we brought the artifact back to the camp after fighting off a few more undead that made their way into the camp looking for the artifact we did as much as we could in the time we had and had to wait for sunrise the artifact its self was a fairly ornate wooden lack of a better term stick it seemed to be that of a celtic knot design inscribed in the stick i didnt recognize who the patron deity was but it was a double sided cross design the celtic knot bordered the edges after we got some sleep the maykar looked into the relic it seemed to hold its own life force allowing those that could use magic an extra source to draw from it could also be destroyed and completely obliterating all undead in a wide area unfortunately it was only the size of a small battle field so it would not purge these lands when morning hit us scouts found a few penitent that were already battle worn and in a fit of fanaticism attacked the scouts they were shouting we have a doom stone unsure what these unholy sounding doom stones were we came to the maykar again they seemed a little shocked with what we said by doom stone they informed us that doom stones were pure evil so much evil that any living creature would be rendered down to its very structure with pain wounds and pure agony the undead would be unaffected and perhaps empowered by this as well so if they have a doom stone they are making a secure foot hold the only thing that i figured we have is ranged weaponry intelligence and agility yet if one of us steps foot inside that effected area of the doom stone we will be dead and offering ourselves as a free meal the maykar also provided a means to destroy the doom stone to smash the paladins relic into the stone shattering it and destroying it thus freeing up the section of land and removing the possible breeding point of evil the real trick would be on how to infiltrate close enough to actually slam the artifact into the doom stone the maykar had a way around that since we cant step into the affected area without dying we would be able to combine our cleric powers to create a leap frog style divine barrier we would have to take turns casting and holding the barrier so we could get close enough to smash the stone the affected area was roughly fifty feet in diameter from the stone from what the scouts reported the penitents were also keeping out of the area the few that did not watch where they were died a horrible agonizing death while the other penitent were cheering their passing it reminded us that it was indiscriminant i do wonder how that stone was set up im assuming it was created with sacrifice of the bodies and blood of the ones who performed a ritual of some sort or perhaps it was just a place rot with evil and cropped up if that is the case then we may have to cleanse these lands least we find ourselves jumping off the continent in fear by this time all of the factors were thinning our man power the battles night fights ambushes and scouring we were getting thin on troops this one called the independent adventurers we were going to go as a strike force hit hard and quick hopefully clear the area out of penitent then hopefully wind around and seek protection with the priests of divine barrier to shelter us from the undead we closed in and saw the omniscient site the area around the doom stone was dead no growth or anything the plants trees and anything living seemed to be as if it were ravaged by war for a thousand years just hard dirt dead grass and hollow trees if these crazies known as penitent were set on doing this to the land why trade a free life for the life of shackles and walls all evil leaders i have met dont share power to me this was pure lunacy best to kill them before we find out it is infectious and have to kill every good man woman and child in the area these are desperate times but i will not lose my head about this business nothing good has ever come from panic upon seeing how much death was in the area i did think that this would be my last moment to die destroying a rock it was black with runes and symbols on it it glowed with evil we began our march on the doom stone the fighters flanked the sides and crushed the flanks giving us the ample time to set our path one of the maykar went first with her divine barrier then the other and then i had to step in and two more maykar divine barriers later we were at the rock one of them held the barrier over the rock and the other began a prayer that was when from the tree tops an eagle eyed sniper shot the maykar that was holding the barrier through the hand and up the arm with the immediate ceasing of the power we all collapsed to the ground faster than rocks off a trade cart we tried to crawl our way out it felt as if our veins were filled with razors our skin was peeling off and our vision was slowly going dark that was when i was pulled up from the ground and slammed on a rock an undead ripped what little flesh was together apart the world grew black and cold as i saw the dream state i then saw with my own eyes lush fields with rolling hills a large monetary with a bustle of activity as i got closer i could hear training drills being shouted from just beyond the walls i approached the main gate and a thin woman veiled in a hood but with what few features showed perfectly beautiful she slammed a large maul in front of herself she said your task is not done with a tap of the hammers head on the ground a quake began i fell through the cracks and found myself alive with both the maykar around me mending my wounds together with divine magics they did not look in the best of condition their wounds protruded through their white vestments but had signs of magical mending with the three of us barely able to move i realized that one of the maykar had the divine barrier up and the other one was beginning her mantra again to destroy the stone my blade was in no need at this point the penitent upped their resolve to take out the maykar they lined up their archers in the tree line just outside of the affected area and began raining arrows on the location either my shield becomes a pin cushion or my body will look like a porcupine arrow after arrow and trick shot after shot the arrows came in deflecting or absorbing them into my shield until i heard a shout of furry behind me one of the maykar with significant force generated by the divines channeled through her arms shattered the doom stone the evil that permeated the area dissipated the penitent broke and ran and the dead left the area we got our broken weary bodies back to the main camp and tavern we suffered heavy losses that fight most of the adventurers were dead and quite a few footmen were too as we came back to report our success it was countered with some chilling news a banshee was on the loose and looking for vengeance for destroying her doom stone and routing her plans for the area we had enough time to get patched up armored repaired weapons sharpened and honed and assemble with the troops our ranger squad was down to a handful ayaton ronin myself and two others i forgot the names of without much any delay after the necessary was done we lined up on the field of battle we positioned ourselves with a lake to the left of us so they could not flank us and a dense forest that even the syndar were not able to traverse on the right of us a wide open field in front of us the worst part was all of our survival supplies and gear was destroyed or used the maykar were exhausted and had no manna to assist in the battle i was then called out of pure duty to fill my cleric roll and heal the wounded i would have to spare myself from the fight and only engage the very select targets the men were to engage any human they could find and lead the undead to me so i would be able to destroy them with holy wrath simple plan but i doubt it will be that simple when the fighting intensifies line after line of penitent crashed up against our shield wall victory seemed inevitable until the undead came in we were taking few losses and what wounded did come back i was able to patch back together or heal magically rather than waste the time on blessing weapons it was much easier to do holy wrath on the undead the main difference was time in this battle i have to spend a few minutes with a mantra over the blade of choice to imbue it with the power then the soldier needs to beat the undead into submission and then activate the holy word to banish the undead with holy wrath that is all bypassed a sudden surge of power thrust through the channeled caster and the undead is destroyed the disadvantage is the troops are helpless until help arrives moral was fading a bit when the undead broke the line we had to go from our straight line to staggered line formation to allow the undead to be ensnared in the holy wrath when they figured this out thats when the piercing screams of the banshee came around her piercing scream got in our heads every scream seemed to emanate from the mind rather than from her this started to turn the tide destroy the moral and tilt the favor in the penitents advantage no amount of physical abuse was able to stop the banshee arrows just stayed where they hit and did not impede her movement blades only came away with dust and cloth and then left the blades men open i remember seeing one of our own rangers grab on to the back of the banshee and attempt to sever her head like childs play she grabbed him and held him high and screamed in his face with that his head exploded after seeing that ayaton called the wing protocol this was for all remaining rangers to leave the field of battle the only issue was  it was only ayaton and i when he called the wing protocol i began to leave and then saw the rest of the forces collapse i had to stay i was the reason they were wining i came back rejuvenated with some potions i found with no mercy slaying any human being in my way and showing the furry of the divines with my hands a womans soft yet commanding voice told me to march on i went forward blazing a trail of blood and coming up to a man proclaiming our doom i thrust my sword through his back and watched him sputter and die with that the horde and banshee left we sustained heavy losses it was a bitter sweet victory just before the doomsayer breathed his last he asked where do you come from as if someone else was in my body i showed my vestments with an emblazoned seal of ethnessa on it he screamed in pain as he bled out and died we lost over 130 good men and women that day all the adventurers that came died the only three that made it were ayaton corporal tavin and myself was this the price that we were to pay for our continued survival were these few measly coins what we deserve for saving the day without ayaton and i this area would be torched and full of death yet we were only granted some extra time to recover other than that it was business as usual i was so furious that i wanted to leave yet i know that would not be the best yet i did have a lot to weigh on my mind i wrote my exact thoughts in a journal that i left behind i know not where it went i remember being furious and full of anger i may have written or said some things i dont remembered for now i will continue to find what power holds this evil here and destroy it we cant fight this war forever at this rate we will lose and we will all bow a knee to the dark and evil onesthis partial journal piece was discovered near a village that was the site of a bloody battle it was recovered by a vandregon scout and turned in to the local commanders fighting unit  that we captured today our policy has been to take no prisoners nor show mercy to the blasphemous infidels of the penitent sir elswich will not let us take her life however giles says he thinks our lord must know her from somewhere for there was a heavy sadness in the knights eyes when we found her and he has been distracted and ineffective as a commander ever since we have made no raids nor have we marched we sit idle and wait for nothing most of the work has fallen to the yeomanry and much of the decision making has been made by squire ablebrook the squire has been at least taking the initiative to send out short patrols but they dont really accomplish anything except that they occasionally get ambushed by cowardly rebels who hit and run but wont engage us honorably the longer we sit here the more isolated we feel and the more vulnerable to the attacks of the actual undead army we desperately need to link up with the baron and the rest of the 5th regiment sir elswich is the only one who can order the company to march though and for some reason he refuses to after seeing the atrocities carried out by the hands of the so called penitent cult my fear was quickly replaced by anger and my desire to get out of here alive seems less important than revenge i talked to chaplain bors about the darkness in my heart he explained to me the same virtues of chivalry that i have had pounded into my head over and over again ever since i joined up one of those of course being righteous anger he says that it is virtuous to want to defend the weak and to carry out justice but then he talked about the danger of a monster hunter becoming a monster themselves if they revel in the dark aspect of their duties more than the sacred aspect the war changed today i was talking to giles earlier and we realized that neither of us knew what day it was how could we forget the counting of days is the most important thing in the world to a soldier while away on campaign for it is in the numbers that we find the salvation of our hope and morale more so than even our faith in the gods do soldiers place their hopes and dreams upon the march home at the end of a tour we have forgotten how can this be crane thinks that it is an omen that none of us will make it home i was assigned a shift of guard duty with the infidel today she rants and raves and from what i can tell has deep conversations with the grime beneath her fingernails i did my best to distract myself from the unpleasant smell and wretched noises she makes sir elswich came into the tent this afternoon and ordered me to leave so he could interrogate the prisoner as i stood watch outside the chaplain approached me he seemed angry he went into the tent and got into an argument with sir elswich for all his talk about how soldiers like me need to control our anger he wanted to kill the cultist right then and there they did not i had to deal with her ranting and cackling for another three hours before my shift was over i was sent on a perimeter patrol today we stopped in the village of ipsdale to refill our water from the well giles drew water for the lords hounds but they refused to drink despite the blistering heat maybe if we werent so hot and miserable we would have been more astute and seen the danger it was too late for giles crane and brumley they were all dead within 15 minutes of drinking the water when we returned the squire sent me straight to prisoner detail i didnt even get to eat anything first i tried to take a nap in the tent since the prisoner was actually being quiet for once i turned the brim of my helmet down over my eyes but i couldnt sleep i could feel her damned eyes upon me i couldnt ignore her out of nowhere she started talking to me we arent supposed to talk with her so i did the best i could to keep my mouth shut and hide beneath the brim of my helmet too bad about brumley she said he was healthy and strong he had a better chance of making squire someday than any of the rest of you i didnt say anything but i silently wondered by what witchcraft she knew of brumleys demise perhaps she was just guessing since i was working his guard shift rotation surely thats all she is as clever as she is treacherous a silly aspiration however she said in the grand scheme of things soldiers yeomen squires knights and nobles are nothing but cog pegs in a pointlessly toiling mill sure the nobility might think that they make up a more important part like an axle but the world never revolved around them even an axle would just be another component do you know what brumley was he was a cog peg a simple wooden cog peg easily broken off of the gear wheel easily replaced just like you wars happen and you get broken off and replaced all the time maybe even a new axle gets installed this is different though the stream that turns the wheel itself will soon trickle to a halt and the mill will grind its last everything will be dismantled do you know what that makes you i didnt answer her spare parts for an obsolete machine a simple wooden cog peg with no other use besides what it was carved for maybe you might find yourself shoring up the wobbly end of a piece of furniture or something sooner or later though you will burn in someones fire i stood to sound the alarm but then thought better of it what was i to tell the other guards that she was creeping me out instead i sat back down she kept talking but i was able to tune much of it out by silently reciting the virtues of chivalry over and over in my head and praying for strength against the temptation to split her skull right then and there had to guard her again today she was quieter i actually fell asleep on duty in fact because she was so quiet i woke up to find her kneeling and staring unblinking into the roof of the tent with her arms outstretched she was perfectly immobile for quite some time i found it unsettling i thought maybe she was in a trance or something so i tossed a clod of dirt at her dont do that please she said still unblinking i am trying to pray for you she took a deep breath closed her eyes and went back to her meditation as the warm afternoon sunlight bled through the canvas roof of the tent it gave the edges of her face chin and nose a certain softness that i had never noticed before she is actually quite beautiful i got to sit with her again today i asked her what she meant when she said that she was praying for me and she just smiled we talked quite a bit actually she is so smart she must have a lot of education i brought her a bucket of warm water today i know that others have splashed her with cold water through the bars of her cage before under pretense of cleaning and basic hygiene but in actuality just to be mean to the poor girl i rounded up a cake of soap as well and placed them inside her cage so that she could properly bathe and wash her hair she began to disrobe and i immediately felt ashamed i averted my eyes and turned my back to her so that she could have some privacy the temptation to watch her was overwhelming and i fell to my knees in prayer what are you doing she asked i told her that i was praying to resist the temptation to gaze upon her in her nakedness she laughed at me the sound of her laughter brought me great pleasure and i found myself closing my eyes and envisioning her flesh why would you pray for such a thing she asked do you really think so little of your god that you believe him to have time to fret over something so trivial as how you use the eyes with which he has gifted you or do you think me unpleasant to look at i most certainly do not i protested i think you i stopped myself before i said it well then she said get control of yourself turn around and do your duty guard you are supposed to be watching me are you not of course maam i replied i turned and did as she told at first i hid beneath the brim of my helmet but eventually i gave in and watched her bathe you do realize how silly it is to pray for such things as strength against temptation do you not she said you are a creature of free will are you not why then would you ask your god to be your puppeteer doesnt he have better things to do like keep your faithful brethren from being raised as the undead i found myself taken aback by the bluntness of the statement i would have said something in protest of her blasphemy but i felt as though i couldnt get any air of course she said that is in itself a silly notion as well is it not your god wont stop you from coming back as a walking corpse any more than he will stop you from using your own eyes to see the naked truth i tried to tear my eyes away but found myself unable to she rinsed her hair the truth i asked yes the truth she said tell me the truth i said please the truth is that you have been deceived your entire life you have been manipulated these people brainwash you into thinking that you have to act a certain way and threaten you with the notion of having to face the afterlife based on your obedience or disobedience the truth however is that you dont have to fear the after life you dont even have to face it you can choose not to go i was beginning to understand i have told you the truth of the penitent youre the one in a cage she said not me but now the door is open it is up to you whether you stay or whether you leave she dried herself off and was about to get dressed when she noticed how filthy her clothes were go wash these for me she said wrapping herself in her blanket instead as i hurried off with her clothes she called after me thank you dear you are my favorite guard i got in trouble for leaving the prisoner unattended the other day while i did her laundry the squire wanted me whipped but sir elswich refused to sentence me he is especially distracted and distant the last couple days because we have learned that a maykar paladin is coming to our camp along with another contingent from vandregon the rumor is that our lord is to be relieved of his duties and that it was the chaplain who sent for the paladin the maykar paladin and his troops rode into camp this morning the sun was still coming up and their horses were weary so they must have rode all night the troops that were with him were not militia from the army of vandregon though they were fully armored men with kite shields bearing the lion rampant there was a lot of confusion as the men at the gate had already let them in but then sir elswich started ordering everyone to take up arms he was in his full plate and wearing his great helm when he confronted the paladin and ordered him to leave the paladin presented him with written orders to stand down and to transfer both his command and the custody of his prisoner the next thing we knew all chaos had broken loose sir elswichs greatsword flashed in the dawning light and the front legs of the paladins beautiful grey horse suddenly tumbled away from its body as it pitched forward rolling on top of the holy warrior and crushing his left leg beneath its girth the sound that the animal made was one of the most terrifying things i have ever heard in my life the lions of arnath moved in to protect the fallen paladin and suddenly everyone was fighting the men of vandregon were split some of my comrades attacked the intruders other attacked their brothers in arms through the swirling melee i saw the chaplain grab a weapon and run through the battle towards the tent where my love was being held prisoner i did what i had to do it doesnt matter anyway he wasnt my chaplain anymore for my love has shown me that i never had need of that god anyway the truth has set me free i was quite proud of my ingenuity today the wooden splints are nailed straight into the bones and the stiffened boiled leather wraps and glue keep everything together the grey horse walks again thanks to my handiwork and the magic of my true love she says that the more raw flesh the nightmare consumes the more the mare will heal eventually our hardy redeyed mount wont even need the splint hardware anymore this is the glory and the miracle of our merciful death it is not a punishment but a release my eyes are open in the army of vandregon i was but a cogpeg i was going nowhere now here i am my dreams fulfilled riding triumphantly into the rising moon on a grey steed bedecked in the finest plate mail with a beautiful noblewoman hugging me around the waist my eyes open and my heart swelling with joy and courage into battle i will ride like the knights of song and poetry and my glorious fall in battle will be my errand of knighthood for i shall embrace rather than fear my surrender of the flesh i will be resurrected i will be an immortal knight i have seen the miracle first hand for the deathknight sir elswich rides ahead of me finally leading the march back toward the 5th regimentlast month the combined forces of the ulven army were met head on by a sizable mordok force how the mordok were able to organize such a force and who is commanding them is still unknown reports of a strange new mordok adorned in brighter colors and displaying high level of intelligence have been seen leading them this new enemy appearing cannot be dismissed as coincidence in an immense battle involving thousands of warriors on both sides the mordok forces were able to deal a massive blow to the ulven army slogging through the muck of the swamp the fighting was reduced to brave ulven and brutal mordok meeting in close and vicious combat the fighting lasted hours as both sides were unwilling to retreat the decisive move of the mordok to send considerable forces at the ulven armys flanks proved to be too dangerous to ignore under threat of being overwhelmed from the sides the ulven forces called for a fighting retreat war packs were cut off from the main lines and supply wagons abandoned as the terrain would not allow them to regroup easily with the main army forces small camps were overrun and occupants butchered or dispersed in a single day of violent battle almost two thousand ulven and mordok lay dead in the swamp staining the ground and waterways red although this initial defeat is harsh on ulven forces these proud warriors are a long ways from being beaten or overwhelmed the ulven army under the command of the clanleaders and their warleaders have pulled their forces back to a high ground in the area above the muck of the swamp this area is the best place to attempt some kind of defensive fortifications or semblance of a camp crews take turns sleeping defending or building to stay warm and to ensure there is enough room in the camp over a few weeks a decent camp emerges wounded continue to trickle in from the defensive perimeter and war packs sent to counter mordok movements engage in short and brutal missions necessary to keep mordok forces from dominating the area for too long some reinforcements arrive from the shield of mardrun but sending supply wagons is risky the mordok continue to patrol and harass and maintain a solid presence near the camp as the buildup to another bloody confrontation continues the ability to prepare for this next battle and maintain critical routes for troops and supply wagons could be the deciding factors in this dirge swamp combat event players will help determine whether the ulven forces recover from this initial defeat and push the fight back to the mordok or are forced to attempt to retreat back to the shield of mardrun if they even can with the ulven forces and their allies pulled into a defensible position the need for clear paths became staggeringly clear but the mordok forces in the area proved to be much too numerous for the pathways to be maintained many of the brave warriors of the ulven army and their allies were butchered or pushed back to their defended post many lives were lost in an attempt to clear the pathways but it was just too difficult to hold the open areas of the mordoks homeland with the knowledge of the approach of the main mordok forces it was decided that the warpack of ulven and their allies would try to draw the attention of the mordok and take some of the pressure off of the main warfront  as the fighting was about to begin the strange mordok in bright blue was seen again and many claimed it issued a dire warning in the common tounge to the warpack before unleashing a frenzy of mordok onto their lines the battle that came against the warpack and its allies was intense and chaotic the warpack itself was almost completely destroyed and those that remained were beaten bloodied and broken but just as the fight seemed as if it would be hopeless the mordok numbers waned the survivors of the onslaught looked around to take stock of the damage hundreds of bodies littered the battlefield of both ally and foe a cheer could be heard as the brave warriors clung to their brothers and sistersinarms despite the steep cost of lives the commotion the warpack caused allowed the main forces of the ulven army to survive and recuperate from the devastating loss of the last month a shortlived sigh of relief could be felt through the ulven forces but they must make a choice soon as to what actions the armies should take do they try and push back against the mordok or do they take this chance and retreat back to the shield and recoup their losses click here to see photos from the event    as the month of the final harvests before winter fast approaches the allied army of the ulven clans and some colonial forces have been assembling at the shield of mardrun these outpost fortifications have finished completion and mardrun finally has a solid defensive line against the mordok of the dirge swamp in the north clanleaders warleaders and aspiring chieftains have all gathered at different points in the shield to discuss tactics and a plan for taking the war into the dirge swamp most of this year has been in preparation for this moment suddenly the morning of the chosen day to kick off this military campaign begins well over three thousand warriors and soldiers along with their supporting wagons and support personnel move away from the safety of the shield of mardrun they march the largest combined forces of the ulven clans that mardrun has ever seen into the swamp this sizable army dwarfs even the forces gathered at the battle of pyre hills some years ago the final battle that ended the ulven civil war whether or not enough forces or preparation has been done to see this campaign to victory has yet to be seen the minor tribes of the mordok and wandering scavengers are driven back or defeated effortlessly they are simply no match for an army of this size the march is slow as the muck and the swamp are just as much of an enemy as the mordok suitable base camp locations are a struggle to find for a group this large forcing the army to split into smaller groups at night and then rejoin on the march the initial bravado of finally taking the fight to the mordok begins to sour as the logistics to do so begin to add up and take its toll however the ulven committed to this cause do not waver easily and continue to press on deeper than any known ulven has pushed before this conquest does not go unnoticed after days of struggling travel and taking of territory the mordok resistance begins to pick up larger groups of mordok begin to harass and skirmish the ulven forces the pressure begins to intensify as the mordok presence never seems to waver then suddenly as the sun breaks through the dawn of one morning the ulven camps can hear horns in the distance with the dawn comes an immense mordok force more organized and much larger than any ulven alive has ever seen they march like a black tide and have come to meet the ulven army who has dared to invade their homeland the ulven forces and their allies brace for brutal conflict and begin to balance their forces and issue orders this month was brutal for the ulven armies in a hasty attempt to organize battle lines and meet the mordok forces the ulven army coordinated a large main battle group with supporting counterflanking forces on the side as sounds of distant battle rang out these countering forces tried to keep the areas they were assigned under control to deny mordok access to the flanks and supply lines of the main forces after an initial success of wiping out a large group of mordok some of their tactics began to become prevalent the initial waves of whelpish mordok were cut down giving way to more experienced and well equipped ones coming to fight a second pitched battle involving intense closein fighting had both battle groups tearing each other apart with the mordok devastated on the field with a second victory and two more to go the cost of this battle seemed to be too much several lay mortally wounded and equipment busted and rent the momentum of the first two missions wavered quickly as several battle groups went to face the mordok and were cut down or repelled back to their camp as casualties and deaths wracked up the clan steinjottun war pack was on the cusp of being routed then a new figured emerged some form of mordok leader adorned and acting much differently than other mordok the forces it brought to battle devastated the mission group and forced a rout with casualties dragging several corpses and dropping them at the edge of the camp this mordok seemed to be delivering some sort of message before it returned and its forces withdrew a final group went out to search for this leadership figure only to be either cut down or repelled once again as the sun began to set it was evident that mordok forces had dominated the trails and areas around the ulven armys flanks and the counterflanking groups failed to stop them reports of immense casualties split battle lines and even devastated supply wagons began to reach the main ulven army with the brutal frontline fighting and the flanks being overwhelmed the ulven army has sounded a retreat and moved to nearby high ground entire war packs have been lost or killed scouts missing and supply wagons cut off from the main group in the first few weeks of the war in the dirge swamp the ulven forces have been dealt a serious blow both mordok and ulven forces have suffered immense casualties in a short period of time whether or not the ulven army recovers from this and is able to continue the war or must coordinate a retreat back to the shield of mardrun is still unknown click here to see photos from the eventafter the recent events in clan whiteoak territory all of mardrun holds its breath to see if the proud warriors of clan whiteoak and clan axhound are willing to continue with the peace talks presented to them although slow at first the heroic story of brotherhood by both of the recently fallen chieftains assigned to the outposts has spurred on others to stand down and give this a chance after all the mordok are the real and biggest threat facing the peoples of mardrun the eastern front of the shield of mardrun will need a bit more time to be fully secure but the collaboration between these two clans could prove to be the biggest victory so far in the mobilization efforts of this season as rumors abound as to the upcoming push into the dirge swamp there is a small village in pack goldenfield territory that is far removed from the trials and tribulations of the conflict on the swamps border a small farming community has begun to form around a collective group of colonists and ulven alike this collaborative multicultural village has been spearheaded by a local ulven chieftain vahness barleyrow cheiftain of pack barleyrow has welcomed all to join her pack and help produce crops and prepare food for the upcoming war effort a number of colonists that visited to help with the harvest have decided to stay and put down roots of their own previously known for its quality brewed ale this village has come to be known simply as barleyrow and is a shining example of what can happen when all the peoples of mardrun work together adventurers and travelers alike have come to try a pint of barleyrow ale share their views of the world help with honest hard work for the war effort discuss future plans for themselves and others or simply reminisce about stories of the past barleyrow village was abuzz with activity as word had spread of their success and many flocked to see for themselves this growing pack many of the locals were overjoyed to find the visitors more than willing to put in a hard days work for some simple pay three work crews were organized and set about completing tasks for the village those who were not interested in the work crews helped to keep spirits high with good conversation and exciting stories unfortunately it would seem that trouble could find its way even into a town so peaceful as barelyrow some rough looking individuals arrived to delivery dire warnings from concerned parties to a small number of the groups in attendance but they did not sour the mood for long as they left soon after their messages were delivered  as the day went on a letter from branthur nightriver was read to the gathered crowds bringing a reminder of the impending war in the swamp as night came and many turned in the thoughts and expressions from most seemed to be that of steeled determination   click here to see photos from the event story info  after a rocky beginning to their portion of the shield of mardrun clan whiteoak was able to rebound immensely last month with the help of numerous adventurers and factions from all corners of the continent chieftain knut frostflow of clan whiteoak was able to lead a daring mission to retake the lost outpost the nearby warpacks keeping the mordok forces in the area in check now have a base of operations to return to in addition expensive supplies were purchased and delivered or recovered from lost wagons and donated to the efforts to make the outpost more viable clan whiteoak has quickly gone from being the weakest front in the shield of mardrun to regaining lost ground and pushing ahead to being a solid defensive line however there is still a lot of work to be done with the fall season fast approaching the various leaders involved in the shield of mardrun and the war effort know that this is one of the last chances to get the mobilization efforts under control before taking the fight into the dirge swamp if the allies of mardrun have any hope to be able to launch an offensive against the mordok the stability of the shield of mardrun will be critical to this effort pack frostflow has been granted the honor and the responsibility of continuing to get the outpost up and running and to expand on any tasks that could further solidify defenses or the logistical and martial potential of the area rumor has it that a delegate or chieftain from clan axhound will be making an appearance in order to discuss the clans relationship with clan whiteoak and to seek out opportunities for how clan axhound can get involved based on the recent attempts of pack redwind the neutral pack of former axhound and whiteoak members to get these two clans to set aside differences could prove to be very difficult the idealistic prize of getting these clans to set aside their feud is still worth it to the pack and despite their efforts falling on deaf or uninterested ears they are attempting one final delegation to see if the two clans can see reason in this third and final event of the clan whiteoak chapter of the war against the dirge swamp players will have a chance to make profound decisions that could result in major changes regarding the shield of mardrun and the friendorfoe status of two ulven clans  event summary  picking up with the goingson of pack frostflow and their newly established outpost political stirrings were abundant from the get go chieftain knut frostflow begrudgingly hosted both faye redwind and chieftain arnbjorn axhound within his walls as the two sides were urged to put aside their differences and face the mordok as one a handful of missions were proposed and completed to bolster the efforts of one group in attendance though the voting was split the adventurers made it clear that they supported the unity proposed by pack redwind disgruntled as they were the two chieftains had little recourse against such a majority as the day wound on the missions were pushed and summarily completed time and time again faye redwind and her supporters showed the chieftains that there was hope for a truce the mordok presence though noticeable was lighter than had been expected throughout the day knut and arnbjorn were even convinced to sit down together to begin talks no one expected much in the way of results but even just breaking the ice between the two would be a step in the right direction as the day gave way to the night and yielded to the next morning faye was called away for family matters in her stead ianok redwind took the reins of the negotiations and represented a more forceful redwind mindset despite the unified front pushing them to come together knut and arnbjorn continued to bicker and refused to see eye to eye on much of anything in a last ditch effort to bridge the gap ianok brought the two out into the woods with a handful of guards to watch over them their return was more than a little bittersweet of the seven who left the outpost none were uninjured and the two chieftains lay dead a mordok ambush overwhelmed the group hoping to cut down the leaders of a number of influential organizations across mardrun reminiscent of the founding of pack redwind however arnbjorn and knut cast aside their differences and held off the advancing mordok to buy time for the others to escape in their final moments they were no longer axhound and whiteoak but ulven and they died fighting as one though the loss was tragic their final actions will send ripples through their clans with any luck this will be the beginning of a new era for the two ancient rivals  photos  click here to see photos from the event story info  all across mardrun the pieces in the large scale project that is the shield of mardrun continue to move logistical requirements and infighting among the clans were feared to erode this effort but the hard work of those involved as continued to pay off the mordok have been pushed back or kept in control among the northern borders despite some of the odd movements and tactics of the mordok it looks like the shield of mardrun may prove to be successful however the largest weakpoint in the shield of mardrun is throughout the territories of clan whiteoak suffering a defeat earlier this year the brave efforts of clan whiteoak warriors and supporting allies were able to push back and resecure the lost northern territory two months ago the fighting was intense and cost the lives of a number of whiteoak determined not to be the weak point in the shield of mardrun clan whiteoak has shown that they wish to see this through now a counter offensive is being planned in order to take back the lost outpost the mordok in the area have lost their momentum and find themselves unable to fight back against large numbers but even a light presence could slow down clan whiteoaks efforts while several war packs will move through the territories nearby to help drive back any mordok a group needs to be sent directly to the outpost and take advantage of this movement of warriors in the area this could make establishing the outpost a bit difficult as supplies need to be carried in or expensive wagon caravans used to deliver them once the location is secure during this martial conflict there is also political turmoil clan axhound continues to be a thorn in clan whiteoaks side with the murder or disappearance of the pack redwind negotiator several months ago it seems that most of the traction gained in getting these two clans to finally set aside their grudges is lost however pack redwind is sending another person to the area to learn about what happened previously and to attempt to continue peace talks the whiteoak warpack leader in charge of this mission is rather influential coordinating with this leader could find ways to get clan whiteoak to agree to certain terms both the martial strength of clan whiteoaks northern border and the political tension between the two clans will be influenced heavily by the actions and focus of those choosing to assist during this counteroffensive    event summary  the sun held high in the sky dipping behind the occasional cloud as a band of brave adventurers joined with the forces of chieftain knut frostflow and a collection of caravan guards with one collective goal retake and bolster the whiteoak outpost that had been lost to the mordok in the previous months heat mordok narrow trails and the discovery of a viscerally disturbing corruption idol all interfered with the partys ability to move their caravan to the abandoned outpost but through grit and determination the various people were able to come together and press through and retake the outpost but they did not do so without some loss along the path many warriors sustained lifethreatening wounds and others had much of their equipment damaged once in the outpost they were able to breathe a sigh of relief within minutes of arrival the sounds of blacksmiths and drums rang out echoing through the landscape as healers began their work of tending to wounds throughout the day mordok came in sporadic small groups but they fought with strength and intensity when they made their presence known allied warriors have reported several sightings of mordok casting powerful spells and some have witnessed rituals of some sort that whipped mordok warriors into a blind raging fury the seemingly excessive use of mordok magic raised some questions perhaps there are simply more casters living in the swamp perhaps the war has stirred more mordok to action or perhaps their magic is in a way connected to and bolstered by the blighted landscape of the swamp throughout the day the delegates from pack redwind as well as some other interested parties attempted to appeal to the whiteoak chieftain to impress on him the importance of bridging peace between whiteoak and axhound though the chieftain listened to all appeals with relative politeness there were no arguments strong enough to sway his opinion the redwind delegates are forced to return home with nothing to show for their attempts as the day progressed and the adventurers began to feel they had a strong hold over the outpost they began to turn their attention outward a party was dispatched to cleanse and destroy the corruption idol that had been discovered on the way toward the outpost the idol itself didnt seem to be out of the ordinary but that didnt stop the mordok from making an attempt to defend their work luckily stalwart warriors were able to defend their magicallyfocused counterparts as they poured themselves into a ritual cleansing previous experience with idols allowed the present daughter of gaia to gain invaluable insight into the corrupted idol while simultaneously cleansing and destroying it and while t may take the young daughterintraining a while to process what she gleaned from her ritual there is little doubt that her knowledge will prove useful in the future running high on their previous successes another party was dispatched to locate and return supplies from a caravan that had reportedly gone missing months prior they were able to quickly discover the cart and surrounding it were the obvious signs of battle though the contents of the cart were strewn about the adventurers were able to recover a good deal of supplies that were delivered to the outpost without much issue as the day came to an end the mordok presence seemed to dwindle no doubt frustrated by the walls of the outpost and distracted by the battles with the surrounding warpacks the day was a resounding success and the outpost was able to truly relax for the first time    photos  click here to see pictures from the event story info  haven black market faire on the outskirts of citystate territory lies the settlement of haven this settlement formerly both the home of the pirates of oarsmeet and the nomads of featherfall is usually quiet farmers and colonists who tried to make a living by traveling to start a settlement with these groups have stayed in the area even when those groups and their leaders are long gone renamed apparently as a joke both by farmers looking to start a new life and by those of questionable reputation this settlement is usually quiet for most of the year however the location is an important one to some of the locals periodically a fairly large group of people from all corners of mardrun slither out of their homes or hiding places and congregate in a shortterm market faire farm fields come to life with tents travelers merchants and debauchery anyone who is anyone in the underworld or black market of mardrun attends or is represented at these affairs short lived and always a secret before they spring up these black market faires are legal enough to avoid a heavy hand from the citystate of newhope but a closer look reveals the many dealings that go on here anything from legitimate merchants to thug bands to smuggling wares could be expected at this kind of meetup who knows what one might learn or experience at the black market faire but one thing is for certain attendees had best watch their coin purses their luck and their backs should they be brave or foolish enough to make an appearance citystate of newhope market faire after the citystate of newhope settled in with their recent purchase of clan nightriver territory the focus of newhope has mostly been inward with growth expansion and changes to the old colony model also come challenges with the recent change in the council of the citystate leaving the leadership of newhope in far fewer hands worry has begun to spread throughout newhope territories this along with the heavy expectation of the ulven clans for all peoples of mardrun to get involved in the war against the mordok has also helped expand this worry in an effort to draw attention to the successes of the citystate and perhaps also draw attention away from some of the recent scandals the council of newhope has pushed to host this years major faire travelers merchants and delegates from all over mardrun are expected to attend a public decree has been given that contests of martial ability and games of chance will be sponsored this year awarding larger prizes than previously seen before at market faires one can expect that the nobility of mardrun will either be in attendance send representation or will at least be keeping an eye on any major turn of events    event summary  haven black market faire windows are shuttered and doors are locked as the sun begins to set in haven with the waning light dark forms slowly emerge flitting like shadows down streets and alleys until they reach the center of town the square is lit well enough but everything seems to be dusted with darkness like black snow covering the town and her patrons men wearing the badges of the haven town guard drifted throughout the gathering floating from booth to booth to ensure the protection of those in attendance though a cursory glance would identify their task as a simple shakedown disreputable businesspeople set up stands and hawked their wares as though they were common merchants in any other town for a while if one was not paying attention it would have seemed to be a normal day at the market save for the cover of nightfall then the knife fight began not some quarrel between to rivals nor a mugging gone wrong the fight was organized and announced by the guard as was the betting a brutal display of quick hands and quicker reflexes the knifefighting champion lay dead in a matter of moments at the hands of his challenger since excitement seems to be a slippery slope shortly after this fight ended another began this time unsanctioned by the guard an ulven warrior accused several locals of assaulting him from behind and sought ulven justice unfortunately in haven justice means little and ulven justice means even less blades were drawn and voices raised until a number of other fairgoers were able to help talk things down tensions remained high as the prolific ulven culture clashed with the seedy underbelly of human and syndar society but violence was kept in check merchants and patrons went about their business many eager to complete their transactions and get home before proper authorities arrived in the morning as the fair seemed to be winding down however excitement reared its head once more allegations of slavery and kidnapping were leveled against many residents of haven as well as a handful of visitors unable to stomach that possibility weapons were once again drawn on both sides as the guards sought to contain the incident even as many attendees decided to dish out their own form of vigilante justice a brutal battle took place with the attendees fighting against the town itself most managed to escape with their lives to flee to safety or be taken into custody some however were not so lucky and lost their lives in that bloody mess of a town   newhope market faire rumors spread of a vicious massacre near the border of grimward territory not too long ago though the bright banners jingling silver and infectious aromas of the newhope market faire quickly soothed the concerns of the fairgoers a strong showing by the newhope watch reinforced by members of the standing army put many at ease knowing that a repeat of the events of haven would be suicide to say the least tournaments were announced early in the day urging warriors of all disciplines to enter for a chance to win silver and perhaps more valuably the notice of newhope diverging from previous structures a grand total of five tournaments were announced single combat team combat archery mage tag and the grand melee the fights were declared and the combatants clashed following each round a champion was named and awarded their prize as he does prince aylin added an unexpected twist to the grand melee however the combatant who showed the greatest honor in the ring without being named champion would be granted an opportunity to become a squire under a knight of new aldoria the honor went to an agent of newhope mirroring the scenario two years prior when a soldier of new aldoria was granted a title of note under newhope for those less inclined toward violence taverns and shops were set up around the square selling all manner of sweet and savory treats bits and baubles and adventuring equipment galore games were enjoyed by player and spectator alike most notably the rousing match of chairs early in the day and the many rounds of blocks throughout the festivities played sometimes with blades sometimes with feet and usually with alcohol this event was clearly a major investment for newhope the donation to the tournaments the location itself and the officials and guards attending on their behalf was just a portion of the silver that poured into the market faire it will be hard to disagree though that the morale gained from the festival and the bonds strengthened as the war to the north ramps up will more than pay for themselves in good time    photos  click here to see pictures from the event story info  saturday as the war against the dirge swamp is the focus of most of the continent trouble has been brewing in the primarily human colony of starkhaven the chapter of the fist the more zealous and militant chapter of the order of arnath has shocked many by executing a military coup moving their forces from their occupation of serai the chapter of the fists military forces have seized control of the keep of the order and detained the hand of arnath the hand was scheduled to make a profound decision about the order and the direction it would go in the future with the leadership of the order under lockdown tensions and worry grip the populace of starkhaven the chapter of the fist has a long and proud history of decisive action and martial ability the new chapter of the light has been seen making a large impact on the world and softening the hard edges of the order of arnath will the negotiations between the hand of arnath and the chapters that make up the church go well and diffuse the situation or will hard lines and stoic pride force a martial confrontation between the forces in the colony the future of starkhaven rests on the decisions of those involved internally and those who travel and arrive to support one side or the other in this scenario players will be involved in tense diplomacy featuring several different elements of the church of arnath and starkhaven the negotiations early on in the day and the decisions made will set the pace and decide which areas are focused on during the second part of the scenario sunday all across mardrun the clans and colonies have supported the shield of mardrun and the efforts are paying off defensive positions and outposts although basic have been built and give warriors a chance to formulate an actual defense against the swamp clan shattered spears resounding success in this effort has proven that when people work together and put aside their differences then the shield of mardrun can succeed however the situation is not going as well to the east clan whiteoak the other clan whose borders make up a significant portion of the shield of mardrun has not had the same focus supplies and amount of cooperation as clan shattered spear some groups have been helping with their outposts and the war effort but it is not nearly as cohesive or organized as the western front in clan shattered spear warpacks run themselves ragged trying to maintain some sort of buffer construction crews attempt to build outposts but lack the logistical support and supply lines to do it quickly or well clan whiteoaks former treachery as a clan seems to continue to influence decisions made to assist them by others this situation combined with clan axhound continuing to fan the flames between the two clans to the south have taxed clan whiteoak almost completely however rumors have been floating around that pack redwind composed of former whiteoak and axhound people that have put aside their differences and live together have become vocal about the clans trying to work together a delegation from the pack is said to be in the area as well visiting outposts and trying to be a voice of reason among the two clans although clan whiteoak holds through determination the situation will not be able to survive much longer a call for aid has been sent out across the outposts of the shield of mardrun a larger mordok counter attack has pushed into the conquered territory of the clan the mordok have driven back or killed the warriors and construction crew of the outpost in the area and push south back into whiteoak lands this area of the shield of mardrun needs help and quickly in this scenario players will respond to a call for aid and attempt to salvage the situation in the area clan whiteoak warriors will be trying to reorganize and push back against the mordok counter attack and pack redwind delegates will be trying to establish some sort of diplomatic negotiations  event summary  saturday with the summer heat weighing heavily on those gathered both chapters of the order of arnath agreed to meet and discuss the situation at hand what began as peaceful quiet conversations between the leadership of the chapters soon devolved into shouting between the members in attendance claims of heresy and faithlessness were thrown around but luckily the arguments ended and each group returned to their respective camps before weapons were drawn now knowing that there would be little to gain from continued diplomacy with the fist the chapter of light decided upon a plan of action to finally break the siege and called upon their allies to assist them in doing so the first task at hand was to ensure that the chapter of the fist could not call in martial reinforcements a nearby unit of unaffiliated lay order militiamen was contacted and a meeting was set up as their allies watched for possible retaliation or espionage the chapter of the light convinced the local lay order that the hand of arnath was compromised and until he was free any orders from him must be considered suspect after several minutes of discussion the lay order commander agreed that their unit would remain neutral in the fighting at least until directly ordered otherwise by the hand with the lay order out of the fight the allies soon moved to their next objective securing the area around the keep by disrupting the supply lines in and out of starkhaven swords and shields clashed as the groups were locked in skirmishstyle warfare manned mostly by the lay order and led by a handful of lions the defending group was able to keep their grasp on the supply lines for a long while but eventually broke against the shields and steel of the chapter of light time was now against the fist within the keep they had lost their martial support their supplies and a great deal of political support from the populace the chapter of light moved in towards the keep prepared to strike directly against a unit of lions in the area with their knowledge of the settlement heavy armor and extensive training the fist lions were able to dig in and reinforce their location prior to the arrival of the light and their allies but their momentum could not be stopped the two sides met in a pitched battle as the dust settled too many bodies littered the ground devoted lay order members of both sides and even a handful of lions had fallen in the fighting the chapter of the light could claim that they achieved their objective as they managed to drive off the unit of fist members though one would hardly see fit to call it a victory   sunday the relief of seeing reinforcements overcame the few remaining whiteoak warriors initially in the area too quickly as they were cut down by the attacking mordok before they could be saved the mordok fueled by the slaughter pressed into the adventurers who had come to assist clan whiteoak and were met with shields and arrows with the mordok forced into a retreat or cut down where they stood the adventurers were hesitant to advance too far and risk a counterattack so soon after arriving the relative safety of this camp allowed the attending redwind delegate jodil redwind to set about her duty of brokering a peace between whiteoak and axhound between the diplomatic distraction and constant mordok pressure there was little time for anyone to rest throughout the day some relief was found as a shocking sight took place near the front lines of the camp an axhound huntress and whiteoak warrior engaged in discussion rather than battle their words were heated and charged with emotion but they were words nonetheless around this same time the mordok seemed to pull back their attacks coming further and further apart the day was finally brightening in favor of the adventurers of course such luck could not last soon the now terrified huntress reported back to the camp that jodil had been found dead murdered along one of the trails a knife and bottle were found near the scene both thought to have been used in the murder most suspicion fell upon the huntress and her cousin both axhound fighters in whiteoak lands before a thorough investigation could be performed though misfortune came crashing down even harder a furious push by the mordok battered the adventurers pushing them all the way back to their camp by capitalizing on the confusion and chaos of the murder after this push the adventurers were able to rally and retake the ground they had lost and then some by the days end despite heavy losses the whiteoak outpost was saved and the day was won    photos  click here for photos from this event story info  after the final front of winter melts and finally gives way to spring the war effort in the dirge continues on mordok are turned back all across the shield to the north reports come in of constant skirmishes but no real attempt for mordok to break through as long as war packs are kept in the field and supply lines keep arriving to support them the buffer between active troop movements are allowing fortifications to be built with the warmer weather comes a new challenge of an ease of movement for both patrolling warriors and mordok the effort to maintain this line is working but the hard fortifications and rotation of troops for rest are going to be needed soon recent developments at pack dawnrocks outpost have allowed allies to solidify some of the surrounding area both with martial and logistical efforts along with expanding on some of the knowledge base revolving around the corruption magic of the mordok rumor has it that some of the colonies to the south are looking to invest more time into researching this magic and tension has been growing with some of the ulven in the area namely the appointed warpack leader to the southeast of pack dawnrocks recently constructed outpost lies the packs main settlement of dawntop neighbors to pack silvercreek dawntop has long been a central hub of trade and warrior movements for decades with active troop movements and new defensive fortifications to the north dawntop has become a safer place than it ever has been these hub settlements are critical for the war effort and are seen as a last stop for supplies and warriors before being sent north to support war packs or deliver construction supplies to the new outposts martial tacticians quickly realize the critical supply lines that settlements like dawntop are becoming and making sure that things are moving smoothly could heavily influence the war effort dawntop has been tasked with organizing and delivering loads of supplies via wagon route to different parts of the front lines local ulven are pushing for supplies to go north to pack dawnrocks outpost and continue to make it an impressive fortification clan grimward and clan nightriver allies have expressed concern over too focused of a supply line and are urging a shared delivery of supplies to all areas of the front line further more local farmers and hunters are hoping that focusing on and expanding on viable farmland could give dawntop the ability to keep up with the high demand of food and supplies needed to keep the warriors in the fight against the mordok while the local chieftain has noticed that the overall area is safer because of the war effort the lines of logistics and coordination required to make sure the war effort is adequately supplied is a daunting task the impact for better or worse of dawntops ability to support pack dawnrocks outpost to the north or potentially also supporting nearby allied war packs and units will depend on the coordination effort and accuracy of those assembled at the settlement  event summary  without the imminent threat of mordok assault the residents and visitors of dawntop were able to breathe easier as they set about their day fires were built to hold swarms of insects at bay despite the oppressive heat and humidity of the day glasses clinked in taverns to rival the strikes of hammers on anvils tending to spirits and equipment respectively as the day settled in several residents took the initiative to organize expeditions to secure the area and support the war effort ultimately proving successful beyond expectations these expeditions ran nearly constantly throughout the weekend showing that not even nature can truly dampen the will of mardrun and her inhabitants not everything went smoothly however tensions remained between audhilde spiritclaw and warpack leader sigurmond shattered spear the former seeking aid in her clans research into the corruption magic trapped within a young mage continued to butt heads with the latter who felt that such dark magic was utter blasphemy and ought to be destroyed in its entirety rather than studied without their subject in attendance however the conflict remained subduedfor now also adding fuel to the growing distrust around camp was the exposure of a number of criminals throughout the weekend one pair was caught stealing and was set to be executed by sigurmond himself once they were finally apprehended another pair a father and daughter this time seemed to be collecting investments for improving the wagons of the war effort to make the movement of supplies easier though they were exposed as scam artists and forced to return the money they nearly made off with most troubling however was the revelation of theft from the warfront itself through bureaucracy and confusing contracts the plot sought to redirect the supplies destined for the shield of mardrun through various other settlements with several moving parts hoping that some part of the shipments would be lost in transit and resold for a profit elsewhere through a collaborative effort by a number of the camp residents the plot was revealed and the criminal apprehended though no one is quite sure how deep this rabbit hole truly goes    pictures  click here for pictures from the eventstory info stand against the black news spreads like wildfire across mardrun the initial month of the war against the mordok is a success while some warpacks of ulven and their allies experience stiff resistance in various parts of the swamp the reports coming back from the frontline are relatively similar the mordok are being beaten and driven further north across multiple areas victory after victory is recorded as the next plan of this initiative is drawn up these victories do not come lightly and have had a bloody cost scores of ulven and some of their allies are killed in combat as the invasion grinds to a halt as the warpacks venture deeper into the swamp mordok resistance is initially driven before the warriors and cut down in large numbers and then continues to get more cunning organized and coordinated venturing any further into the swamp would see warpacks isolated and overrun instead of pushing deeper into the swamp the larger war effort is to patrol and hold this conquered territory with the intent to fall back to fortified positions which are now being constructed with mordok driven north it gives these construction crews room to build and move supplies and the peace of mind knowing that warriors stand between them and the monsters to the north however this moment of respite is brief and the opportunity is now safe from roving mordok engineers and construction foremen have scouted out the best possible locations for outposts there still seems to be a lack of cohesive planning in how many outposts should be built in the largescale effort but construction has begun in earnest as the mordok resistance continues to take its toll on the warriors campaigning in the swamp the construction of these defenses are critical every day that goes by gives the mordok a chance to lash out at the war effort or retake lost ground following last months success the warpack of pack dawnrock of clan shattered spear has sent out a general call for aid to come and support the next step in this plan warriors of this pack and their allies recently endured hardship together last month as they fought to conquer territory and the warpack leader is once again looking for help in this scenario event players will either play existing or new pack dawnrock ulven of the clan shattered spear warpack assigned to this area or supporting allies as they focus on the next step of the plan numerous tasks await to make sure both the outpost is constructed fortified and viable along with the surrounding areas patrolled maintained and supply lines kept open event summary the dirge swamp seemed to rise up to reject the invaders bringing a strange cold and freezing rain into the newly established outpost work was slow going and patrols limited as a result but the raindampened spirits of the shield of mardrun could not be so easily broken trudging through mud and snow several armed patrols established an allied presence in the area deterring much of the mordok activity the camp had expected while a few young whelps strayed close to the camp no concentrated assault was mounted and those within the walls of the outpost were able to focus more thoroughly on the various tasks at hand such a strong military presence did not come without a cost however the bodies and attention required for the patrols took several of the potential workers away from the camp those that remained worked diligently to improve the land but with so few bodies and tools the work barely caught the attention of the shattered spear warriors who would be manning it they appreciated the work that was done but were hoping to be able to focus more completely on the fight to the north rather than improving their own camp within the camp itself tensions flared as sigurmon shattered spear and audhilde spiritclaw butted heads on how to deal with the walking talking corruption idol that was now inside the outposts walls the warpack leaders hand was stayed as those around the corrupted young man urged patience in the matter but the seeds of doubt had been planted scholars and researchers began to investigate the young man magically poking and prodding him to see what might happen a handful of breakthroughs were made on the subject through divine magic and the research opened doors to further discovery   click here for photos from the event story info  the wolves of war with the focused attention of the ulven clans shifting north and the support of most of the continent plans continue to move forward with the shield of mardrun project it is still too early to know for sure what the final product of this initiative will be but heavy effort is being put into making this work caravans of supplies and building materials along with numerous warpacks filled with ulven looking to earn honor continue to move north or stage in the nearby clan territories regardless of the supply lines and logistical support everyone eagerly awaits the first and critical step taking the fight into the dirge swamp with the mild winter comes a chance to start earlier than expected and send warpacks into the swamp and carve out territory that can be controlled by the ulven for generations the ulven have done little more than stand on the edge of the dirge and look north into the unknowns of the swamp only a brave few venturing into its lands on daring or foolish expeditions now the ulven bring war to the mordok of the dirge swamp the success of this war will ride on a combined effort of military forces and the defenses built by supporting units but many know that brave warriors stepping foot into the swamp to face the dangers it holds will make or break this war early on as battle plans are formulated by the warleaders of the ulven and their colonial allies the success of this first step will require territory to be taken and the mordok to be driven back as far as possible from the northern borders of both clan shattered spear and clan whiteoak and the fringes of the settlements of serai and onsallas this massive effort of moving warriors north will rely on each group pushing into the dirge and cutting off the mordok from getting too close should this first invasion attack proof successful it should buy the supply lines and construction crews the time they need to begin making fortifications that should prove invaluable to maintaining defenses in the future in this scenario event players will play ulven warriors volunteering allies or camp supporters that have been assigned a section of the swamp to conquer the success of this military campaign rides on the ability for this warpack to defeat and drive the mordok back  event summary  spurred on by the promise of glory the whispers of economic boons or political pressure from clan grimward the warriors of clan shattered spear and their gathered allies amassed on the edge of the dirge swamp to strike the mordok in their home this blitzkrieg was a risky maneuver coordinated across the border of the swamp and requiring uniformity as the warpacks pushed forward if they were too aggressive they would be stranded in the swamp away from their allies if they were too cautious they would waste the element of surprise they currently held as the adventurers made their way deeper into the swamp they were first approached by a number of mordok whelps young and inexperienced the whelps stood little chance against the organized unit of warriors continuing on their path however the mordok became more aware of the intruders and were better able to mount a resistance slowing the adventurers but not stopping them in their assault during the campaign a corruption site was found and dealt with although many still have questions about what was actually done to the magic within the spiritclaw daughter of gaia who performed the ritual was less than forthcoming with details once again the adventurers were assaulted this time taking a great deal of damage from the now seemingly veteran mordok warriors but ultimately they prevailed the day was won the warpack had secured the land that was expected of them and would be able to dissuade heavy mordok interference in the coming weeks a discussion began of pressing further still well within the safety of the warpack line along the border to prove that this warpack was capable of great things though there was some dissent the decision was made to continue to press their weary bodies for one more fight the next den of mordok was ready and waiting for the group however eager to protect their homes from these invaders and to avenge the dozens of deaths that had been inflicted these remaining mordok fought with a ferocity unseen so far that day their savagery and the warpacks mounting wounds turned the tide of the battle in favor of the mordok and the warpack was forced to retreat several warriors including a young ulven a new aldorian representative and a griffin of arnaths light were left behind during the chaos some more willingly than others in the end the day was won and the territory secured but the ambitious risk taken proved too great and the price paid was steep    photos click here for pictures from the event story info  last months honored hunt with the great wolf was a momentous occasion for the ulven people warriors from all across mardrun volunteered to be deemed worthy to join the great hunt this honored event combined with the recent grand moot has raised the morale of the ulven people considerably the entire continent seems to be lit up with excitement over this turn of events and the start to this new year with purpose honored as it may be the great hunt is also a terribly bloody event numerous war packs and dozens upon dozens of ulven are killed during these hunts the mordok are fought and slaughtered every chance the ulven get and combined with the efforts to clear the forest by adventurers and local warriors the great forest on mardrun is almost entirely cleared of mordok the army of mordok that used the forest to devastate the former clan riverhead is no more save for a handful of scattered mordok and the surviving shaman that was sighted the great forest is deemed clear now attention turns north to the swamp the wardens a new faction based out of clan ironmound has been tasked with using their home settlement with being a host to a number of visitors and potential allies or partners to this shield of mardrun project the largest obstacle is the logistical challenge of getting warriors supplies and building materials north this is no small feat and just the coordination alone could prove to be the biggest enemy to this bold new plan clan ironmound has volunteered to become a central hub for the coordination north towards the dirge merchants nobles warpack leaders and people of note are expected to travel to clan ironmound to find a way to get involved or find a way to profit or gain from this large scale venture whether the momentum of the unified ulven people continues to drive onward or stalls under the weight of logistics and deep rooted feuds has yet to be determined event summary dignitaries and representatives from the largest of the ulven clans made their way into ironmound territory to the settlement of semya haven home of the wardens soon enough they were joined by their human and syndar counterparts a banquet was prepared and drinks served as the attendees began discussing their business nightriver and grimward seemed to finally agree on the first point since the civil war that the mordok were a credible threat and that the people of mardrun needed to band together and take the fight into the dirge swamp scholars and griffins of starkhaven banded together with their spiritclaw allies hoping to convince others that the arms race this war would bring required research the mordok had several years of preparation and the ulven needed to catch up newhope secure in their location encouraged a modicum of caution moving forward preferring to secure the border and strengthen the bonds and economies of their lands in the wake of their recent split clan stormjarl bolstered by their new aldorian allies sought to sail around the swamp and deposit troops and supplies along the northern coast and forcing the mordok to fight on multiple fronts and helping to secure a victory for the people of mardrun despite the many voices calling for attention those of nightriver and grimward were heard the loudest by calling in favors making deals or intimidation the two clans have convinced a large number of settlements to send what they can spare to the swamp hoping to push as far northward as possible before the swamp thaws too thoroughly and traversal becomes nearly impossible   photos click here to view photos from the event story info  last month visitors came to clan ironmound territory to meet with representatives and delegates of the different clans of the ulven people tensions were high as wounded honor and feuds threatened to derail some of the focus of the upcoming grand moot the leaders were able to discuss many options of what the future could hold and directions the ulven people could take camilla birchborne acting high priestess of clan riverhead brought with her two important messages the first was that clan riverhead was no more with the death of the clanleader the impending passing of the ill warleader and the breakdown of the high priestess the leadership of clan riverhead has been ravaged in a short amount of time the surviving chieftains have supported this new direction of being absorbed into other clans primarily clan shattered spear the second is that camilla believes there is an upcoming great portent that the ulven people must not dismiss next month in january the moon will shine full not once but twice and she and the other priestesses feel that this is the time for action for the ulven people the grand moot was held and was over surprisingly fast setting aside differences for now the ulven people as a whole will begin coordinating with the colonists to sweep through and clear ulven lands primarily the great wolfs hackles and the great forest to prepare for a large construction project to build a series of defenses to the north the time for ulven to sit idly by and allow each clan to fend for themselves is over the ulven pack is coming together and taking the fight to the mordok with the blessings of the high priestesses of the clans the warleaders have begun putting together warpacks of veteran warriors that will join the great wolf in his hunt on the first full moon of the year instead of staying indoors veteran ulven and warriors looking to gain word fame have pledged their support and hope to be chosen as the first step of taking the fight to the mordok a group of ulven warpacks and their colonist allies are moving into the great forest to sweep and clear it of mordok forcing confrontation with the mordok is key to the victory as any tribes or group of mordok slipping through and rejoining other mordok will prolong the efforts of clearing ulven territory    after event summary  warmth spread through the land as the hunt began seeming to bless the assembled warriors in their duty plans for an assault were quickly drafted and thrown into chaos shortly thereafter as the bloodied and broken warriors of pack longfang arrived some seeming to be on the verge of death prioritizing the safety of their allies over the hunt itself time and resources were allocated to getting the warriors back on their feet and fighting fit the fleeing mordok pressed by steinjottun warpacks sensed this stall and tried to press into the camp itself through a hard won battle they were repelled but the urgency of the situation was not lost on those in the camp groups were organized to travel out and do battle with the mordok throughout the day and though the cost was high several decisive victories were won against the often elusive foes the discovery of a nearby corruption site and the presence of a powerful shaman were cause for concern though capable warriors and casters agreed to join both fights clerics ventured to the corruption site ultimately destroying the idol within and dispersing the dark magic from the area the fight against the shaman however was less successful confronted by a new faster version of corruption and a powerful staff the warriors facing the shaman were eventually overwhelmed by the surrounding mordok coupled with the shamans unnatural toughness and powerful arsenal at the end of the day a great many mordok lay slain in the melting snow though the shaman was not counted among them though the great forest was not cleared in its entirety mordok movements and numbers have been greatly disrupted and many strategists believe it will take them months to recover any form of substantial fighting force    pictures  click here to view pictures from the event story info  the grand moot summit as news spreads like wildfire that a full and viable cure has been found to the creeping corruption those afflicted begin traveling south to nightriver and newhope lands in order to be cured it will take time to administer the cure to everyone that has fallen ill especially with the onset of winter so worry raises over being able to tackle this obstacle in the winter in clan ironmound territory the clanleader gustav ironmound has been adamant in being host to a grand moot of the ulven people with the recent dissolution of the watchwolves clan into both clan grimward and clan nightriver and the unknown future of clan riverhead right now stands to be a tipping point in ulven history fractured in proud clans rocked to the core by the discovery of the lorespeaker conspiracy and struggling with cultural identity and living alongside the survivors of faedrun the ulven people have been building to this moment for quite some time the call has been sent and it has been heard the grand moot will be held at a settlement in clan ironmound territory and delegates from every clan are expected to be present even if the clanleaders themselves cannot be the settlement itself will be under heavy guard and reserved to the clanleaders and their delegations einar stonefist warleader of clan ironmound is insistent that the level of security by heightened a summit with all of the leaders of the ulven could be considered a ripe opportunity to some however the outskirts of the settlement are going to be a flurry of activity supplies will be coming in by wagon patrols constantly sent out to secure the local countryside and smaller meetings will take place before the grand moot representatives from the colonies and their outlying settlements have been given a general invite to come to the outskirts of the summit and meet with representatives of the clans the leaders of the ulven people wish to know more about the perspectives of the colonists and of current events before they decide the fate of the ulven people for years to come in this scenario event players will have the chance to play major political leaders of the ulven people or attempt to sway them to different causes for the upcoming grand moot or fill in as one of the outlying settlement helpers in maintaining security and the logistics of supplies  event summary  movers and shakers from across mardrun gathered in ironmound territory and not even the brisk winter air could calm some of the tempers that began to rage old wounds were reopened as the delegates from each clan confronted each other and made their cases colborn whiteoak and trygvye axhound clashed as was expected from the old rivals and arguments erupted between calder whitecap of clan squallborn fritha stormjarl and wargah grimward feeling their lands were stolen from them and the culprits could not be trusted with such a major decision lines were drawn in the sand early on and loose alliances were formed both among clan representatives and the many factions across mardrun taking an interest in the future of the continent changes which had in some cases already taken place as announced by the acting high priestess camilla birchborne of clan riverhead the traditionalist clan would be dissolved due to their lack of resources to protect themselves from the mordok and would be reformed as pack riverhead choosing to join pack shattered spear because of the latters dedication to the ulven way and their ability to grant riverhead the revenge on the mordok they so sought fortunately the attendees were conscious of the security present at the event and stayed their blades inside the outpost as the sun began to set the delegates returned to the official summit to cast their vote or relay their opinions to their clanleaders after a great deal of discussion and several nights later the decision was announced each of mardruns great clans would band together and clear the great forest and the great wolfs hackles of the remaining mordok while the smaller groups would begin defending the border of the swamp once the forest and the hackles were clear of the beasts the clans would march on the dirge swamp and its inhabitants the likes of which had not been seen in recorded history mardrun is going to war   photos click here to see photos from this eventstory info with the recent faction conflict winding down in clan nightriver territory attention has turned back towards the north earlier in the year during the summer groups of adventurers were able to stop the mordok from continuing to establish a foothold in the great wolfs hackles mordok activity has also been more idle after the large force devastated clan riverhead but reports from clan whiteoak and clan shattered spear say that the mordok have still been active on their northern borders with the winter fast approaching it is still unclear as to the goals of the mordok one thing is for certain desperation continues to grow for those that are afflicted by the corruption sickness every month the reported death toll continues to rise it has been a year and half since the emergence of the incurable creeping corruption many bear the scars and maiming of dangerous attempts at curing and destroying the corruption and many more mourn for those who have died because of it with the mana construct deciphered built and successfully turned over to both the citystate of newhope and clan nightriver there is hope that a cure is soon to be found word has reached the colonies and clan nightriver clan shattered spear recently pushed back an advance of mordok in their territory in a remote location in the forests on their northern border they have come across a corruption idol while this is not unusual this idol seems to be infused with the same type of corruption as the potent magic that makes up the creeping corruption ulf mossguard the warleader of clan shattered spear has pledged to keep the area clear of mordok to allow a team of people from the colonies to come and experiment on the corruption idol the mordok continue to harass and raid the area seeming intent to recover their lost idol and have been known to slip through the ulven patrols the nearby ulven warpacks can only maintain the area for so long before they need to regroup in the safety of nearby villages this is the best chance to find a cure and help those afflicted before winter it is a race against time to see if a team of volunteers and scholars can coordinate defenses around the idol and coordinate what must be done to finally create a viable cure to the creeping corruption   event summary night fell and anticipation rose as the group of adventurers scholars and warriors made their way deep into shattered spear territory to the supposed location of a new corruption site with the new cure in hand their lone purpose was to test and confirm its viability in the field perimeter guards were set soon after arriving at the sight as those with skill in divine magic began to piece together pieces of the puzzle that remained an ominous fog hung heavy in the night air shadows jumped and flitted mordok could be seen just beyond the tree line and every failed attempt at completing the ritual seemed to push the reality of the situation further and further to the front of everyones mind much to everyones surprise and nearly as many individuals dismay the redeyed syndar made an appearance seeming willing to bargain untold knowledge and power in exchange for information on the ritual despite his efforts and the constant threat of a mordok assault the scholars from starkhaven and newhope managed to connect the final pieces of the ritual to banish the corruption within investigating the extent of the rituals power also showed that the same ritual can be used to cleanse an individual which will lead to a great deal of rejoicing across mardrun as hope begins to burn ever brighter in these dark times   photos unfortunately as this was a night event there are no photos to sharestory info tension grips mardrun as a combined force calling themselves the allied group has marched to the foothills of the spire home to the archons the spire residents begin to raise concern over an organized force arrived at their doorstep a treaty has been delivered and verbal exchanges made among the spire settlement and the allied groups camp the archons independence from outsiders is threatened as the treaty states several terms including bringing in a wanted criminal controlling research and payment of reparations as a fine the allied group seems steadfast in their treaty details and has given the archons a timeframe by the 28th day of october at noon the allied group expects an answer to be given be the archons and how they want to proceed this will give each side of this conflict a chance to negotiate moments before a decision is made postevent story info a counter offer to the allies original treaty had been put forth and now tension hung in the air as the deadline to accept or refuse drew near with allied forces waiting just outside the gates and archon citizens preparing themselves negotiations between both groups leadership were slowgoing some residents of the spire chose to accept vazra as their savior while others denounced him as a madman but remained proud archons either way these people would fight for their homes slowly but surely cooler heads grew in number and in volume as the terms of the treaty on both sides were analyzed explained and discussed claiming his right to the title of archmagus of the spire faolan led those who would follow him in denouncing the actions of vazra and beginning their life anew only those devoted to their former leader resisted though faolans magic and the combined numbers of the allied forces and the archons themselves quickly and nonlethally apprehended these protesters whether or not this new structure can withstand the trials of mardrun is yet to be seen though many feel it is a step in the right direction   story info as the events at the gates unfold the farms of the settlement of the spire are quiet for now the allied group has laid siege to the farms cutting off the farmers from the critical fall harvest farmers spire defenders and soldiers of the allied group stare each other down quietly but ready to act at a moments notice once a decision is made at the gates should the defenders be able to break the siege on the farms it could allow them to continue harvesting to gather much needed food and supplies postevent story info the bandits led by the man who had previously tried to steal the mana construct from newhope and their scholars notsopatiently waited to hear the sweet ring of combat they had been offered looting rights if they would fight for the spire and knew that no fighting meant no looting and no looting meant no payment taking matters into their own hands the bandits soon turned on their former employers many of whom were already nervous at the thought of such ruffians protecting them and their belongings where they hoped to find a broken injured people scattered throughout the settlement however the bandits soon met a wall of determined archons set on keeping their homes intact to the surprise and ire of the attackers these archon forces were reinforced by the very allies they were supposed to be fighting against now outnumbered and outmatched some bandits fled while others still tried to extract their payment by the time the dust settled several dozen bandits had met their maker with a handful more either captured by the allied forces or wounded too severely to continue fighting this display of unity has led to a glimmer of hope for the future of the archons and of mardrun as a whole   for pictures from the event click the link below

full cure has been found a scholar in the chapter of light district of starkhaven has uncovered the mysteries of the mana construct this construct is a unique magic sequence that can be used to create a cleansing ritual that could fight back and destroy the dangerous corruption weapons of the mordok a vocal proclamation has been made that starkhaven is going to share this method with both the citystate of newhope and the leaders of clan nightriver a group of scholars has been dispatched to starkhaven to get what they need and return to the main colony and begin work on creating a cure with a chance to find a cure seemingly on the horizon word has also reached the ears of desperate people refugees afflicted by the corruption or bitter due to recently losing loved ones before a cure was given have been rumored to be on the road and following the supposed cure people often get desperate and sometimes dangerous when their lives or the lives of their loved ones are on the line a tavern located along the newly created roadway of newhope has heard word that some of the bandits that fled davens reach have been involved in stirring up some trouble it is suspected that this group is taking advantage of the refugees and hopes to capitalize on this desperate situation the scholars have sent word to newhope that they are going to wait for an escort back to the main colony and fear for their safety while on the road newhope has dispatched a unit of soldiers to reach and escort them but they will not arrive for two more days a general call for help has gone out for any people of note and trustworthy factions in the nearby villages and settlements to provide support the fate of many lives and perhaps that of the entire continent rests on the mana construct reaching the newhope colony safely and intact postevent story info preparing to dig in and wait for reinforcements to arrive the caravan from starkhaven happened upon a small farming village along their way whose mayor graciously offered them lodging for the night within his walls many of the caravans guards remained uneasy and on edge during the night while others took the chance to let their guards down and relax though some of the rougher citizens of the town seemed interested in seeing the visitors off quickly and a number of heated exchanges took place no harm was actually done tensions and tempers rose throughout the evening as strange howling was heard in the woods and a number of mischievous acts took place as the sun rose the following day though the mana construct and its bearer were still safe and accounted for moving out shortly thereafter a more organized force approached the adventures with their goals clearly laid out they sought the cure and they sought coin and were more than willing to kill for it to prove this point they brought forth some hostages they had taken a cleric of arnath a corrupted young mother and her infant child as the adventurers pressed in to collect the hostages warnings were shouted and blades were drawn across throats in the ensuing chaos the mother nearly bled out before being rescued and tended to by the healers as was the cleric the child was not as lucky succumbing to her wounds in the arms of her captors the scene appeared to create just enough of a distraction for the bandits who managed to make off with the mana construct with the leverage they needed the bandits were able to keep their wouldbe attackers at bay though a traitor in their midst nearly gave his life to return the device to the caravan too concerned with the wellbeing of the mana construct the bandits were not pursued and remain at large though their initial plan to take the cure for themselves was thwarted click here for pictures from the eventfollowing the destruction of clan riverhead the mordok appeared to split into three main groups the first has stayed in the great forest and continued to harass any who attempt to enter the area the second has traveled back north and has returned to attacking clan whiteoak albeit from the south this time and the third has made its way into the greatwolfs hackles some unsubstantiated reports indicate that the mordok in the hackles are starting to alter their clothing and armor to better suit their environment and that they have began constructing clusters of primitive lean tos a claim which experts on the mordok mock stating that what has been found is the remains of a hobo shanty town nevertheless rumors abound that this may be the start of a new breed of mountain mordok holmar bloodmoon has offered a bounty to be paid from his own pockets on these mordok stating that the danger is too great to wait on branthur nightrivers indecision supporters of branthur deride holmars bounty as a political stunt designed to purchas support from not only the warriors of clan nightriver but also warriors from outside the clan branthur loyalist insist that these mountain mordok will return to the swamp with the snows that will come in a few short months following holmars declaration of bounties on the mordok adventurers made their way to the mountains to seek glory or riches others followed suit with the intention to help or protect their homes from this threat collecting in small camps scattered throughout the mountains many were surprised to be joined by warriors from clan grimward moving troops so close to nightriver territory was a violation of the treaty signed many months ago in spirit if not letter they came with a purpose however and for that reason they were not rebuked small bands were organized throughout the days to scour the woods and search for mordok too many sent out would leave the camp undefended and would scatter the mordok rather than crushing them too few would be no match for the threat they faced and would fare far worse than their target the ringing of blacksmiths hammers and filled tankards filled the air as those who remained in camp worked to keep spirits high and armor repaired though they could not always drown out the cries of pain from the healers mats following the return of a hunting party shortly after the departure of one such group the camp inhabitants were called upon to draw steel and spell against an unexpected visitor a dead body reanimated by some form of magic shambled nearly to the center of camp before finally being destroyed and properly disposed of still more than a dozen mordok were eradicated the first night their teeth collected as trophies to collect payment the next day the mordok seemed to grow wise to the adventurers plan of setting ambushes for them to fall into and would move throughout the forest with alarming speed and numbers accompanied by a number of shamans including the shepard bannica yulrude this concentrated effort pushed the ulven and their allies into a defensive position where they could plan their next move it was ultimately decided that a dedicated push on the camp from which the mordok were arriving was the only way to truly unseat them from the region and destroy their presence before they established a strong foothold packing up most of their camp to establish a forward base close to the mordok village the adventurers split into two groups to keep constant pressure on the mordok during the fight wave after wave of the beasts spewed forth from their huts until finally their leader stepped forward wielding a solid slab of metal as a shield the alpha took blow after blow until it became overwhelmed and submitted itself to a ritual the beating of drums and the chants from the whelps around it seemed to reinvigorate the alpha closing wounds and allowing it to fight on through sheer persistence the foul being was finally felled and the mordok driven from the area httpswwwfacebookcompglasthopelarpwiphotostabalbumalbum_id1415151331931383as the world focuses either on the expansion of infrastructure of colonial territories or the dire threat of the mordok attacks against the ulven clans day to day life continues on in numerous settlements and villages all across mardrun spring gardens give way to early summer harvests and the heat begins to set into the land crows landing home of the rangers of crows landing has been selected again to hold a market faire far removed from the frontlines of the mordok conflict merchants nobles and travelers alike look forward to the yearly festival that allows a mixing of cultures and trade goods many merchants have begun to enjoy the fruits of the labor recently and newly paved roads make getting to and from settlements much easier than before clan nightriver traders and merchants used to the more rugged conditions afforded in ulven lands see first hand how prosperity and expansion can benefit everyday life and enjoy the ease of trade as travelers from all corners begin their journey to crows landing the settlement prepares itself to receive people for the several day occasion rumor has it that some nobility may be making an appearance at the faire their presence a much sought after luxury that could help numerous causes projects or agendas those in attendance hoping for a quiet day of revelry and trading were soon to be disappointed as other attendees of note started filtering in with guards stationed at every entrance to crows landing with instructions to apprehend vazra of the spire for questioning the air was already thick with tension though not publicly announced duke joakim ventrini and his son spent much of the day conversing with merchants and tradesmenthe arrival of wargah grimward daughter of clanleader haygreth grimward also shook things up as she began questioning the fairgoers about her missing clanmates though answers were not forthcoming she did eventually leave before creating too much of a scene following her departure the fair was visited by prince aylin of new aldoria a regular patron of these events as the festivities drew to a close though the prince became embroiled in negotiations for an item which had been removed from his property hearts were pounding and steel was readied as tempers flared much to the relief of some and the chagrin of others the negotiations ended without violence though it seems the damage done has yet to be seen https489photobucketcomuserwolfreconlibrary07_23_17_lh_marketfairedespite valiant effort on the parts of several groups help has been too little and too late to drive the mordok from the territory of clan riverhead and the clan has been broken the last few months have been rough on the people of riverhead as defensive lines have found their people giving up immense amounts of land to the mordok army that has come out of the great forest the mordok are random and brutal in their tactics without a single decisive battle to determine the outcome in the great forest allies from numerous clans have arrived to help but without a cohesive plan and most of riverhead already raided or razed during the initial onslaughts the future of the clan looks bleak renewed hope comes from an unlikely ally as clan grimward has requested and been granted permission to march its warpacks through the pass and provide cover for a final retreat a calling has been made to clans and settlements for those able to assist in the evacuation of those still trapped between the great forest and the great wolfs hackles high priestess lyrri riverhead of clan riverhead has made a plea for a small well armed group to assist her in the transportation of an undisclosed cargo which is said to be vital to any chance of retaking the lost lands and for protecting her people in the time to come with the whole of mardrun focusing on expanding infrastructure and growing settlements clan riverhead has endured the brunt of the mordok onslaught while this devastation may be the rallying cry to finally bring the ulven clans together to fight back largescale against the mordok that sentiment means little to the people of clan riverhead who have either fled their homes been hiding out in isolated villages or have been cut off from a valid means of escape the mordok onslaught of clan riverhead continues again this month as reluctant clan members finally admit that their homelands are lost after the initial hard push of the mordok force into clan riverhead territory from the great forest the ability to counter attack and push the mordok back has been unsuccessful despite efforts from small nearby clans and smaller factions trying to help the call for a retreat was given this comes at a time when more allies arrive such as warriors from clan grimward to try to fight back against the mordok some even assisted with spells and vocal support by the colonists and adventurers who just several years ago found themselves at war with each other even if the clan riverhead lands were lost to mordok this large scale assault on the ulven people has finally been a rallying cry for their people to stand behind reports have already been coming in that the mordok have not been able to pursue into other clans territories for now the civilians left behind were organized and evacuated by a group of adventurers and mercenaries time and time again small groups of mordok would scout and patrol and were beaten back or driven off by organized defenders however reports of entire groups and families of riverhead refugees being cut off and slaughtered trickled in from ulven scouts moving through the area the efforts were going well and many were saved but there were also some that could not be helped by the end of the final evacuation the number of survivors well outpaced the number of dead and clan riverheads people were saved from destruction much to the surprise of the clan riverhead people several of the adventurers took the time to save an enormous barrel of lunashine an expensive and important alcoholic beverage known in riverhead territory to everyones surprise lyrri riverhead the high priestess of clan riverhead used her escorting war pack of ulven warriors as a distraction to keep the larger mordok force at bay long enough to retrieve her cargo this was soon discovered to be an item that was being transported to be delivered to the high priestess when the scout did not arrive a search party was sent out to find out what happened to them the scout did not survive but the item was found but due to distrust among the clan riverhead people and the outsiders who claim they came to help the item was hidden until a time when the outsiders and the ulven who were helping them were deemed trustworthy by the high priestess a small group of ulven tended to the defense of the high priestess and the success of her mission guaranteeing her safety news reached the defenders of the riverhead people the warpack of ulven nearby had been driven off and the larger mordok force was on its way gathering as many people and supplies as possible the group set out to escape along a specified route that was scouted and the best chance for survival after evading the mordok for a time the escape turned into a pitched fighting retreat with groups of mordok relentlessly pursuing the refugees and their defenders after a hard fought retreat the group was able to save many and escort the high priestess and her cargo to safety

economic base within aylins reach far away from the influence of the fledgling citystate to this effect he has ordered that the villages and outposts left behind by clan squallborn in their retreat be reactivated he is offering generous compensation to private individuals who wish to assist in this process or provide security for those who wish to do so the small outpost of sandmaw is one of the first on the list and peoples from many backgrounds are flocking there to take advantage of the princes offer gathering at the recently operational sandmaw outpost in the territory of aylins reach new aldorian soldiers welcomed adventurers from across mardrun to join them in their mayfair celebrations a number of tasks required the immediate attention of the outposts soldiers including reinforcing the walls and patrolling for potential squallborn raiders who had been seen in the area as the first day progressed a number of casters inside the outpost noted strange occurrences when reaching into the mana stream as they would meditate to regain the mana they had spent a small portion would be siphoned off and pulled north this led to a number of small ventures into the surrounding woods to hopefully triangulate the manas destination though by the time a solid map was made it was too late to investigate it fully the following day not even the poor weather could dampen the spirits of the celebrants as they participated in feats of strength luck and mind as victors were named they were awarded tokens to show their prowess though the weather kept the competitors from finishing the final two feats there was enough gusto left in a few of the attendees to make a push north as the sun began to set seeking out the strange anomaly in the mana stream siphoning mana away from casters after a long trek through woods and marsh and led by visions of a stump in a clearing the group finally found their destination a small lanternshaped object with an odd gem in place of a wick the first adventurer to touch the lantern vanished in a flash of blue light and the others quickly made their way  wet and weary  back to the outpost to rest for the night on the final day of the celebrations research began in full on the lantern strange markings and an odd blend of arcane and divine magic seemed to emanate from within although the true purpose was unable to be discovered on a happier note the champions from the previous days feats were asked to compete once again in the feat of feats where they used any skills at their disposal to endure a savage beating in the name of the celebration to be named the lord and lady of spring in the end neither the lord nor lady of spring had a blow struck against them through separate unconventional means the celebrations drew to a close as the sun began to shine for the first time since the revelry had begun and the adventurers spent the rest of the day recovering from their feats enjoying the weather and preparing for their journeys home https489photobucketcomuserwolfreconslideshow05_1920_17_lh_keepingupwiththerichardsas both clan riverhead and the great forest bear the brunt of the newfound hostility of the mobilized mordok presence it has become clearer than ever that the threat of the mordok needs to be opposed the sporadic defenses of clan shattered spear clan whiteoak and pack longfang to the north are wholly inadequate in stopping a threat the size of what attacked clan riverhead as the clans to the south react and send help to riverhead attention has turned north in an effort to unite some of the ulven and solidify the defenses against the mordok before any major efforts are undertaken some of the clans want to know what kind of defensive plan could be viable several abandoned outposts and villages on the edge of ulven territory could potentially be rebuilt and turned into part of the defenses against the dirge swamp and there are two immediate options a small outpost in clan shattered spear territory could be scouted out and turned into a military fortification further enhancing the defensive potential of the north there is also a small farmstead and the nearby abandoned trading post near onsallas village which could be examined for its potential in housing a farm that could grow anticorruption reagents as was discussed at the recent political meeting either option will be a challenge as these abandoned outposts are full of unknowns they will be lacking a number of basic amenities their current status and knowledge of what needs to be done will be unknown and the level of mordok or ulven activity in the area will vary until examination of the chosen location the longfang cart was heavy with supplies the dirt beneath their feet gave way to mud at every step and yet the adventurers trudged forth determined to complete the task before them mordok harassed the procession never standing to put up a real fight but constantly trying to pick off stragglers and let the caravan know that their presence had not gone unnoticed slowly the cart turned towards shattered spear territory decided upon by those protecting it the defensive outpost was more important than the farm when the group arrived they quickly set about trying to return the broken down palisade to its former glory some set up their kits within the walls mending armor or tending wounds others ventured back into the woods on patrols to keep the mordok at bay still more dove into the rebuilding process collecting solid timbers from the woods cutting firewood and clearing brush from the trails though the mordok presence was constant organization from these men and women got the outpost operational again much to the relief of clan shattered spear and their southern allies not all news that day was happy however a few of the longfang pups did not return home that night and the hunter they had expected to arrive at dusk was nowhere to be seen by nightfall in a brighter end to the evening though a handful of shineleaf flowers were collected for the outpost which are believed to make a fertilizer that could produce a sustainable yield so close to the swamp   with the onset of the expanded newhope territory and the beginning of the infrastructure great work a large amount of attention has fallen to the safety and security of the newhope lands and the new roads banditry has been a consistent problem throughout both colonial and ulven lands in what has been viewed as a rather heavy handed response newhope has mobilized some troops and put a call out for a mercenary contract to help them retake davens reach the reach has always been a property of newhope but over the last two years has become a home to a number of displaced families refugees outlaws and former pirates of new oarsmeet while the reach has been known to house a large amount of unsavory people a large number of families have found life at the reach to be easier and less political the fact remains that davens reach is still owned by newhope especially baroness catherine who is a member of the council of ten after a failed attempt to retake the reach by hiring out mercenaries in the past people expect the response to be absolute this time around the way that newhope is making their actions known and spreading the word about hiring on adventurers and mercenaries to retake the reach shows boastful actions of making a statement to all in newhope territory for those that are signing on to help a unique challenge is presented should too few rally behind this contract to attack and retake the reach the mercenaries hired could find themselves in a very dangerous and lethal predicament should too many rally behind the contract and overrun the reach it is expected that the payout and sharing of the spoils of the fight could be minimal at best anyone involved either in swinging a sword or helping with supplies finds themselves in a moral dilemma as the upcoming actions could further displace or even harm families who have nothing to do with the actual banditry operating out of davens reach there has been a small but vocal movement in either actively defending the people of davens reach or in trying to find an amicable or even peaceful solution with percival the current leader of the people of davens reach how things play out are up to those that get involved and are willing to invest or risk in the current situation not far from the last remaining fortification of davens reach the attackers prepared themselves for the battle to come they were disrupted soon after by the arrival of baroness catherine herself intent on witnessing the removal of bandits from davens reach and the thorn from her side in the hopes of reaching a civil agreement the baroness met with percival von borscht the man who had been running davens reach rather effectively since the takeover he expressed an interest in a peaceful resolution and a willingness to return the settlement to the baroness though he demanded a noble title to show his position and two hundred silver to compensate the people of davens reach for the number of improvements they had made over the past two years from the pockets of the attackers came the vast sum of coin and those within the settlement looking for a chance at a legitimate life chose to stand down or evacuate before the siege began in full those who remained either sought no redemption or would find none due to the bounties placed on their heads in the past led by the baroness the marshalled forces marched on the fortification battering ram in tow a handful of defenders skirmished with the wellequipped group outside the walls but were quickly overwhelmed and cut down the ram was brought to bear against the front gate of the keep as a hail of arrows and boulders rained down upon the attackers as the sun began to set at long last the gate began to splinter until it fell entirely allowing a flood of attackers into the courtyard while the defenders fought intelligently and valiantly for the land they now called home they were soon overwhelmed by the attacking force as the night fell in full the last few defenders barricaded themselves on the ramparts of the keep proving too stubborn for the battered and bruised attackers to root out their loyalty bought by the gracious donation of silver earlier in the day however led the former residents of davens reach to step forth as fresh troops who finally removed the last of the defenders the fighting was brutal and many on both sides lay dead or wounded but the day and the reach were won by newhope and her allies https489photobucketcomuserwolfreconlibrary4_1415_17_lh_2dayeventwith the onset of the spring thaw the mordok previously sighted in the great forest have finally made their move clan riverhead calls for urgent help mordok have come out of the forest in unprecedented numbers and are employing a simple but devastating moblike strategy it is unknown how the mordok were able to move these types of numbers into the great forest undetected and any estimates as to their numbers are quickly proven to be in error as yet even more of the monsters emerge from the trees allies are anticipated to send warriors to the aid of clan riverhead but the intensity of the attack from the mordok may reveal to them a destroyed clan before they even have a chance to arrive nearby warpacks of clan shattered spear to the west pack goldenfield to the east and groups of adventurers or mercenaries that have caught wind of the situation on the road have moved to help the people of clan riverhead however this early on the fighting means that the best these defenders can hope for is to stall the mordok while the people of riverhead evacuate an impromptu battle line has formed near the edge of the great forest and south of the main settlement of clan riverhead riverheads largest settlement has already fallen to the mordok and its people are on the run with the goal of holding back the tide the line is sparse and many villages are located beyond its protection clan shattered spear warriors have deployed to the west to defend and clan goldenfield to the east your group has taken up the center of the defensive line and has been assigned a small group of clan riverhead support personnel and a unit of clan riverhead militia has been assigned to act as your reserve your task is simple hold the line hold for as long as possible to give the people of clan riverhead the best chance to escape and survive as the riverhead warriors and refugees were beset by mordok many started to lose hope with nowhere safe and no way to fight back in earnest against the numbers they faced they were prepared to flee or meet their deaths fortunately adventurers from across mardrun accompanied by warriors of pack longfang arrived on the scene to lend them aid wave after wave of mordok crashed against the newly reformed shield wall wearing down the defenders and their equipment for hours perseverance and teamwork won the day as the riverhead refugees were protected long enough to regroup and make their way to relative safety what could have been a complete slaughter of clan riverhead has been tempered into a battle for the lands of the clan although the mordok were outright defeated by the rallied defenders there is no telling how much more the current mordok threat has to offer after the recent announcement from lord baron richards as to the decided upon great work the citystate of newhope has wasted no time the newly sovereign citystate has committed to an ambitious project of infrastructure improvements within their territories the likes of which has never been seen on mardrun central to the first phase of improvements is a highway linking all of the major settlements within newhope territory along the path of the proposed highway locations are being identified to provide basic amenities and shelter to travelers workers traders and soldiers alike abandoned farmsteads are being reclaimed and hamlets previously consisting of a mere handful of buildings are suddenly finding themselves hubs of activity if successful travel in newhope territory will become much easier on merchants travelers and soldiers on patrol you have made your way to one of these hamlets to partake in the lucrative contracts available to both skilled tradesmen and unskilled laborers alike take care in your approach for while hard work will be rewarded with silver profiteering and theft have been rampant and will be rewarded with coin of a different color following the decision to expand the infrastructure of the newhope territory beginning with a great highway stretching from starkhaven to crows landing construction began at a number of sites along the way at one site in particular several laborers came together to begin clearing the paths for construction offering what skills they had to speed the process along and make some silver in the meantime though the areas have reported an increase in bandit activity in recent months and the workers were on guard against such interruptions the tasks seemed to go rather smoothly excepting a handful of wanted posters and the arrival of a few troublemakers while there is still much work to be done before the project is complete the beginnings of the great highway have started to take shape it is evident that although the great work continues security and maintaining order against those that feel they are out of the reach of the common law will continue to be a problem https489photobucketcomuserwolfreconlibrary03_18_17_lh_sticksandstonesort9page1once again during the cold of winter prominent figures around mardrun plan on meeting to discuss actions for the upcoming year amidst the chaos gripping mardrun of the corruption and the changing tactics of the mordok the colonies in clan nightriver territory continue on with agendas that see a different kind of focus lord baron richards and the council of ten have let it be known that newhope is no longer a colony of faedrun and is to be henceforth known as the citystate of newhope this news comes to a shock to a number of people around the continent as the specifics in the background are not yet known what does this mean for newhopes future what kind of change has happened in regards to the land owned by clan nightriver assumptions spread like wildfire but it is too early to tell to mark this occasion the citystate of newhope will be commissioning a great work several ideas have been put forth by members of the council for consideration the marquess madeline dargent has put forth that the best way to showcase newhopes martial strength is to send an armed force to push past the swamp and explore the lands beyond it the celestial arragones backed by the voices of lord and lady alazarma suggests that the knowledge of newhope could best be expanded by sending an expedition back to faedrun to recover books items of power and religious artifacts from tielorrien and other kingdoms she offers to build a grand library in her district to allow for public viewing of these treasures and further research projects dominet martingale of westhaven and duke joakim ventrini call for the construction of a great colosseum in the center of newhope in order to better showcase the culture of newhope and provide sporting games to the populace the lictor mary cul tricuspis proposes the construction of a grand forum where the leaders of mardrun can discuss and codify laws that may hold sway over all peoples and where courts can be convinced to bring the justice of newhope to everyone baroness catherine and baron montesque de la aleine have proposed an expansion of territories farmlands and tradecraft programs to help stimulate the economy and agriculture the public is also encouraged to put forth any ideas they may feel better suited to showcasing the citystate of newhope to that end the council of ten andor their appointed representatives will be holding a series of small public audiences to hear suggestions as to what the people feel this great work could entail as rumors begin to grow as to what the future goals are of the council of ten one thing is for certain the ruling nobles will be deciding on and then placing immense focus and resources into this great work the political affair began with light socializing and a brunch and soon the different representatives of the council of ten and gathered adventurers and factions began to cover many important topics the topic of the hour was what the definition of a citystate meant for newhope which was quickly answered via a public address penned from lord baron richards information was released that a deal had taken place between clan nightriver and newhope and that a swath of land along the coast from crows landing to starkhaven was now owned by newhope this sent a murmur of shock through those assembled as it confirmed that the land underneath the settlements and other colonies had now changed ownership notably both starkhaven and new aldoria whether this would be the start of a stabilization of newhope territory or the beginnings of a bitter feud between colonies has yet to be seen a visiting traveler collapsed in the gathering room sick and afflicted from corruption sparking alarm between those assembled a few brave souls offered to try to help him discussing what resources were available to those close to hand this was a bleak reminder that even here at a secure political function the corruption finds its way to impact the lives of those on mardrun after many discussions took place involving the different reps and those assembled notes were gathered and reports were written the discussions seemed to favor heavily the stability of mardrun and the infrastructure of the new citystate of newhope but there were persistent and convincing voices attempting to sway followers to the forum the coliseum the expedition through the dirge and the voyage back to faedrun the representatives left for the evening to return to their quarters or to report to their respective council members their reports and recommendations being submitted to change the face of mardrun forever https489photobucketcomuserwolfreconlibrary02_17_17_lh_politicaldinnersort9page1bolstered by the success of the august expedition and encouraged by the information it brought back the marquess madeline dargent has once again raised funding and material support for an excursion deep into the dirge swamp however this time it will take place during a time when expeditions have not been sent in the dead of winter simultaneous expeditions will set out from the order of arnath controlled village of serai the clan shattered spear village of direguard the pack longfang village of onsallas and the whiteoak village of salthollow these four expeditions will jointly endeavor to locate the safest routes through the southern reaches of the swamp and will attempt to chart northern areas if able she has put out a call that those of exceptional talent who wish glory adventure and silver should meet with her forces going north from onsallas village this expedition will travel first to the pack blackwing outpost where they will regroup and push further north they will be tasked with gathering information on the winter habits of the mordok as well as their primary task of charting the northcentral region of the dirge swamp the marquess has also advertised for ships and crews willing to round the northern end of mardrun and create detailed charts of the shoreline and any possible landings north of the swamp additional bounties are being offered to crews willing to put in at the two suspected landings to the northeast and northwest of the dirge and field exploratory units of their own to determine what lies beyond the shore as the mordok presence continues to be a threat to the northern borders of ulven territory even as the snow begins to fall in earnest these expeditions have the chance to venture into areas previously untouched by ulven or colonist alike however these four small expeditions have drawn negative attention from around the continent some feel that these dangerous expeditions will become suicidal in the frigid conditions and the resources and manpower put into them are better suited to working on other obstacles as the 3rd logistics expeditionary unit accompanied by several adventurers and hired hands passed the previously discovered blackwing outpost the swamp itself seemed to reject their presence ice turned to mud as the group pressed on determined to find the safest route through the harsh terrain the warm weather a poorly timed anomaly so far north made moving the supply wagons painfully slow the mordok often assumed to be mostly hibernating during the winter seemed to be out in greater numbers than expected as wave after wave of the native creatures crashed against the warriors defending the caravan the decision was made that to continue deeper into the dirge swamp would prove suicidal and the retreat began fighting for their lives against the mordok while trudging through hostile terrain spelled the end for more than one soul along the expedition though fortunately the bulk of the group made it out alive some of the adventurers hired on were able to study a few things such as the surrounding area the strange buildings that were old and of unknown origin and the findings of an area that was strange and different in regards to how the mana stream flowed through it the reported findings to the marquess madeline dargent while not as thorough as she had hoped will likely fuel the fire in the noblewoman to finally push all the way through the desolate landscape to the north a similar fate was noted for the other three expeditions and some believe that the only way to get the rest of the way through the swamp is to send a well supplied army and fight through it   https489photobucketcomuserwolfreconlibrary01_21_2017_lh_dirgeswampexpeditionpreevent story numerous groups and people travel freely through the roads that cut through the center of the great wolfs hackles this mountain range stands forever as a reminder between the differing views of the ulven in regards to the colonists that now live on the continent with the civil war over transportation between the northern and southern part of the continent flows freely once again the fortifications built by clan nightriver at the southern entrance and by clan grimward at the northern entrance are also reminders that the ulven stand divided regardless clan grimward warriors keep to themselves but their cold demeanor at their fortifications are an obvious clue that travelers should keep pressing on instead of staying in the area for too long merchant caravans couriers ambassadors and warriors all come and go through the hackles and camp at numerous points along the road this has allowed the road passing through the mountains to become a hub for information onthetrail trading and banditry  who knows what news could find its way to the ears of travelers and what rumors could be learned about the larger world postevent story as travelers from across mardrun begin to set up camp along the road conversations soon erupted among the multitude of groups in attendance each person carried with them a unique tale to tell and many chose to spread the rumors and stories they acquired during recent travels from the mouths of those from newhope came reports of the growing crowd of corrupted outside the city walls and the desperation hanging over them like a storm cloud escorted by the order of arnath came a number of displaced residents of serai nervous but eager to begin their new life across mardrun pups promised to pack longfang were taught to fight given a small taste of the ruthlessness that would soon confront them daily when they reached onsallas village an ulven male vocally supportive of holmar bloodmoon and his dissatisfaction with branthurs leadership regaled any who would listen with tales of a fish woman of new aldoria though surely such stories are nothing more than fantasy the sources cited couldnt even seem to specify which half was fish and which was woman though the air was filled with the crackling of the fire the ringing of the blacksmiths anvil the murmuring of stories and the songs of the bards the evening sky was split shortly after the sun began to set a shout and cries of pain piercing through the ambience one of the many travelers who wore no allegiance on his person plunged a knife into another man stealing his coin and fleeing into the woods the scoundrel evaded capture for some time as a large group of adventurers hoped to track him down and bring him to justice though he was eventually taken into custody his life ultimately spared this just goes to show that even in the absence of battle or conflict one can never be too careful click here for photos of the eventpreevent story after negotiations took place for months clan nightriver finally agreed to one of the terms set forth by their largest ally clan stormjarl after stormjarl was denied reparations after they chose not to sign the recent treaty that ended the ulven civil war a delegate on behalf of clan stormjarl had pushed for terms to paid for by clan nightriver directly while still being negotiated this agreement gave clan stormjarl two thirds of an island south of nightriver territory called the fire isle home to the small settlement of the phoenix the fire isle is now the location of a major settlement building effort ships come and go with lumber food building supplies and settlers some of the people of clan stormjarl have volunteered to move off the mainland and take up residence at the fire isle and will consider it home this initiative represents a great step forward for clan stormjarl after it was damaged so greatly during the civil war against clan grimward  the trading post of the phoenix settlement has chosen to host a market faire merchants have been invited to come and setup shop and sell their wares tournaments will be held as entertainment for those coming to visit and invitations have been sent out for others to join fuhlka stormtooth chieftain of clan stormjarl is the current ranking leader of the new clan stormjarl settlement and is expected to make an appearance to meet their new neighbors prince aylin a longtime ally of the phoenix and a fan of market faire events to expand political negotiations has also replied that he will be in attendance several other delegates of some of the clans and the colonies may also be in appearance as the rest of the world continues to bear the brunt of rebuilding after the civil war or to defend against mordok raids and the new corruption and some both the market faire stands to be a welcome and light hearted distraction for merchants settlers and visitors alike postevent story as travelers approached the trading outpost of the phoenix settlement on the fire isle the place was alive and bustling with activity merchants from the mainland and representatives from numerous factions were on hand with booths and merchant spreads to buy sell or trade the prince of new aldoria was seen at the beginning of the faire with an escort of marines and new aldorian guards also in attendance were representatives from newhope and also from the order of arnath and clan stormjarl as visitors bought and sold wares talked business or just spent time interacting with each other the tournaments took place near the trading post champions of combat and skill were chosen and awarded silver for their efforts overall it was a pleasant but hot and humid day on the fire isle as banditry was deterred or the remote location of the fire isle making petty thievery less inviting eventually it was observed that the prince of new aldoria and the chieftain in charge of clan stormjarls interests were locked into a detailed discussion about business and expanding their influences and efforts rumors said that any involved in helping the ambitions of new aldoria and clan stormjarl were likely to get rich or at least posture themselves in a good position in the politics of mardrun letters were received and read out loud to all those assembled and one letter in specific was written by the hand of arnath the leader of the order of arnath it detailed out the ongoing investigation into the undead scandal and then had listed a set of names of those wanted for their involvement in this matter this was an official summons of those listed to come to starkhaven and stand trial for what they have been accused of it also detailed out the grace period of how long those accused had to willingly turn themselves in or face the fines and penalties of having a bounty placed upon them for their capture tension rose at the faire as several of the people listened were in attendance and an inquisitor for the order of arnath was able to negotiate with some of them to come peacefully however violence did not break out during the event several people were escorted away from the faire under order custody and await the ship to take them the mainland to stand trial in starkhaven many people watched and wondered where the trial would be who would be in attendance and who would be judge and jury as the faire came to a close the newly appointed baron of keys crossing addressed the crowd and informed all in ear shot that the colony of newhope had acquired the notes on the corruption research and found a cure to the mordok corruption several adventurers from the pack longfang and archon factions were named as helping with this research whispers taken away from the address hinted at a deal in secret that took place some suspect that the newhope representative bought out the research in the name of the colony nevertheless it was made known to all that the colony of newhope now has the cure to the corruption and intends to share with others click here for photos from the eventfirst scenario to do ones duty preevent story while rumors of the horrors of the new corruption and the means used to stop its spread move and morph at a speed that some feel borders on imagination there is word of a village belonging to clan axehound that has stayed concernedly consistent tales would have us believe that the clan has rounded up all affected by the corruption and forcefully quarantined them in a single location whispers abound that the conditions within the village have become untenable as the concentration of corruption causes what supplies that are delivered to spoil at an advanced rate with the warpacks protecting the village firewood for cooking and funeral pyres has become scarce eye witnesses claim that the residents of the village have resorted to using their furniture and even their houses as fuel for the fires dark speculation hints at a permanent solution being the only course of action available to clan axehound should the situation not change soon postevent story upon arriving at the axhound village it was immediately evident just how serious the quarantine was to the clan ropes cordoned off an area to be a visible reminder of where the villagers were expected to stay and it was a clear guideline for any visitors where they could and could not go warnings were given by the warriors maintaining the quarantine were grim but clear cross the line and you share the fate of the village a few brave adventurers loaded with research notes and ritual details decided to take the chance and enter into the village in order to test the methods needed more easily as time continued on the research was slow at first but it appeared that a ritual was able to be created to cleanse individuals of the potent mordok corruption several volunteers from the village volunteered to be tested on with these rituals and although the methods to force the corruption from the body were becoming successful the harm to those afflicted was severe several villagers died in the process but there was proof that these rituals could work if refined unfortunately the impending cleansing with sword and fire of the village was too much for some villagers to bear desperation began to set in and a number of villagers tool farming implements and utility knives and attacked the warriors maintaining the village a brief but bloody fight left dead on both sides of this situation and the chieftain in charge of the quarantine made a proclamation to all within the village come out and face death with honor fighting to the death against his warriors one at a time this bought the clerics and adventurers some time to try to continue the research and the rituals in the village as the sound of honor duels and dying villagers rung out near the small fishing hut being used to conduct the research a hard choice had to be made those involved needed to either trust in the chieftain staying his hand and giving them time to refine the research which was so close to completion or to attempt to break through the quarantine and escape before the warriors could catch them the second option was chosen and when most of the warriors were focusing on the honor duels a number of adventurers made a break for it some managed to escape presumably with the expanded ritual research and some were caught and cut down during their flight with no rituals no research and no chance to find a cure for the village the chieftain ordered his warriors to close in and the entire village was put to death second scenario the cost of conviction preevent story the order of arnaths fist concerned over rumours and direct accusations of necromancy at serai has dispatched a fact finding mission to serai this small group has been tasked with confirming the presence or past presence of the undead the penitent or any other kind of corruption if the accusations of unholy communion are true the culpability of the population of serai will be determined along with the involvement of any outside entities should the need arise this party has been empowered by the hand of arnath to take emergency actions in defense of the greater good the order welcomes persons of integrity from varied communities to accompany this fact finding mission to act in the role of witness but notes that any attempts to obscure the truth will be dealt with as the situation warrants after months of rumors and disinformation the order sets its sights on finding the truth and dealing with this situation once and for all postevent story the combined forces of the investigation team from the order of arnath leadership from the new chapter of the order of arnaths light and allies in the form of the archons from the spire all moved north to serai as soldiers moved nearby to camp it was evident that the entire settlement of serai had soldiers of their own a ominous portent that should a fight break out the escalation could be severe as a plan was formed and the investigation team briefed and preparing for their negotiations with the leadership of bos mezar the investigation team moved into the settlement and went to speak with their leadership negotiations were terse and tense as the order and their allies were not willing to back down and the leaders of bos mezar not willing for them to come in and destroy their undead when a zombie being handled by a caretaker and a small child were brought forth to be witnessed it became clear that a fight was evident both sides regrouped and prepared as neither was willing to back down as swords were drawn shields were formed and the undead brought forth to bear against the inquisition a cry went out from one of the order scouts that mordok had been seen near the settlement the close proximity to the dirge swamp could have meant the mordok attack was isolated and small although flanks were protected against this new threat both sides closed the distance and the fight was on in full forces clashed against each other and soldiers began to drop on both sides in the thick of the melee more groups of mordok began to emerge deeper into the settlement and attack any close enough the fighting was fierce several lay dead or bleeding on both sides and eventually the leadership of bos mezar was captured and the undead all destroyed with no time to rest the group gathered as many civilians as they could and took any prisoners they could and attempted to retreat as the mordok poured into the settlement and laid siege to anything nearby the investigation team their allies their prisoners and any civilians they could gather all moved south towards allied forces and barely escaped due to mordok attacking them the entire way click here for pictures from the event story  preevent summary as the recent corruption around mardrun continues to worsen time is of the essence in a race to find cleansing rituals that can help rumors spread that this corruption cant be stopped and that those afflicted have already started to die what seems to be certain is that unless a cure is found the death toll will continue to rise the recent conference at the bos mezar outpost near serai was able to gain some ground in researching the necessary components to find a ritual to cleanse this corruption there still seems to be a long ways to go until it is discovered and able to be put into practice unfortunately with the short blooms of some of the rare reagents those sighted near serai have since wilted and other reagents must be found some of these rare reagents are known to be seen elsewhere in the swamp and the most likely place for researchers to go is the village and outpost of onsallas the corruption site outside of the outpost the one created two years ago by the red eyed syndar threatens to continue growing as the containment methods used by the daughters of gaia seem unable to continue to keep it in check research connected to this site might also provide useful in finding a cure for the recent corruption however mordok have besieged the pack longfang settlement for the last few months their presence in the area unlike anything seen before rumors say that great tides of mordok threaten to overwhelm the village but the reality is more likely that the presence in the swamp is more active than usual and has not disappeared back into the swamp small skirmishes erupt constantly between village defenders and the roving mordok this poses a serious threat to anyone in the area as merely traveling to and from onsallas is treacherous clan spiritclaw has made the villages plight known to others asking for aid in either fighting the corruption nearby or pushing back the mordok so that they can continue their work  with the recent research hinting at a possible cure and mordok activity so heavy in the area adventurers will travel to onsallas outpost to either continue their work on the research or to coordinate warriors to fight and push the mordok back into the swamp until reinforcements arrive postevent summary the day began with the sounds of battle as the mordok immediately besieged the outpost of onsallas and tested the defenses the walls were damaged and the outer fence was destroyed the mordok presence in the area continued until reinforcements arrived clan stormjarl warriors and volunteers from the recent campaign in clan squallborn territory joined the fight and helped push the mordok back the defenses were tended to immediately as a plan was devised on how to accomplish several different goals the group of defenders and adventurers split their priorities and focused on different areas some focused on continuing the research of the corruption ritual puzzles some went out to try to gather the supplies and tend to the defenses of the outpost and the nearby village and a few gathered a group to try and fight the mordok the constant fighting and attrition took its toll on the outpost but the defenders were able to manage their equipment and make enough repairs and tend to serious wounds to keep functioning research was going well and the defenses and supplies tasks were completed quickly but the mordok threat continued to loom in the distance only one camp was found and the mordok killed or driven off and without a serious push it seemed unlikely that the outpost defenders would make a dent in the mordok of the area a thoughttobeimpossible ritual was conducted and was successful a young daughter of gaia was able to cure the first survivor of corruption whether this ritual is a realistic weapon against the corruption is currently unknown the second day the group decided to continue splitting their resources and accomplishing tasks the final tasks for the defense and supplies were accomplished and then the tasks for combating the mordok were attempted hunters and scouting parties went out to hold key points and keep them secure as mordok roamed the swamp and struck at will groups searched for rare reagents and returned them to be studied the shepherd was sighted among the mordok again furthering reinforcing the dire portent of the mixing of mordok and colonists that turned to their dark beliefs a letter arrived from clan ironmound stating that he would pledge warriors to come to longfang territory and help the small lifeline that clan stormjarl sent via boat seemed to be just enough to keep the defenses going and more reinforcements were on the way as time was about to run out the group decided to be bold and make an attempt on the next mordok camp which was in the nearby pineed forest roaring battle cries and signal horns resounded as the group attempted to attract the mordok back to their camp and win in a decisive victory mordok came at them in the thick of the pineed trees and a slow and tedious battle took place when another group joined the battle the mordok disappeared spooked and driven off but not defeated the outpost lacking defenders was raided and almost overrun by the mordok but remained standing by the end of the second day the outpost defenses were back up and supplies were flowing well and the corruption research was almost complete however the mordok threat in the area was not defeated or damaged enough to drive them back but some progress in fighting them had begun the mordok presence will remain in the area around onsallas for a while yet until enough forces are brought to bear to kill and drive off the mordok click here for pictures from the event story info  preevent summary news of the recent reappearance of the mordok reaches all across mardrun reports come in from numerous clans the mordok are back more organized than ever and bring with them a corruption that cannot be cleansed this has worried many of the ulven and also a number of adventurers and colonists as well especially after a number of victims were corrupted recently during mordok attacks news of the upcoming campaign by clan stormjarl and new aldoria to hire warriors and pay coin for allies for their invasion of clan squallborn despite the reemergence of the mordok spreads like wildfire however there has been an emphasis on the ulven people staying their hand at further violence and instead dealing with this new threat the bos mezar outpost near the village of serai has been chosen as a meeting place for a number of adventurers and representatives for clans looking to solve this issue this is mainly due to the fact that an ulven villager of serai a recent addition to their populace has come forward proclaiming that they are in fact a lorespeaker and have knowledge about different forms of corruption fearing being apprehended and bound by the other clans they have come forward with this information in exchange for freedom guaranteed by the clans a complex set of ritual material and ancient ulven texts has been given to the collective group as a whole in order to help deal with this threat this combined with the wild and unique reagents known to grow on the outskirts of the swamp could provide enough research material to begin to understand this new and dangerous weapon of the mordok or possibly find a cleansing ritual to cure it as several representatives and adventurers make their way to the bos mezar outpost near serai the gravity of the situation is made well known as reports confirm that those afflicted by this new corruption continue to worsen postevent summary as adventurers from all over mardrun assembled at the outpost near serai the research material handed over by the lorespeaker proved to be quite a challenge to those wanting to do extensive research puzzles unveiling clues through divine magic or sensitive arcane circuits needed to be figured out before enough details could be pieced together to create a possible cleansing ritual the clan spiritclaw truthseeker that arrived asked for information about the missing truthseeker he was sent to meet and a group ventured far to the north into the swamp they came upon a grisly sight and evidence detailing out what happened and confirmed that the truthseeker had been viciously killed by mordok more clues to this grisly scene eluded the group and as they returned they were set upon by mordok a harrowing fighting retreat took place with several falling wounded to the mordok attack once back at the outpost wounds and equipment were tended to and research continued a crippled man approached the outpost and delivered a message to a few that would listen cryptic words about the corruption and a possible cure in the morning a small group set out to the meeting place described by the crippled man and to their dismay the red eyed syndar emerged with his mordok guards a lengthy exchange took place that led to expanding the corruption influence of the syndar and eventually turned into an attack on the serai outpost the mordok were repelled but a dire message was delivered by the red eyed syndar time is running out and he knows their struggle in finding a cure as the outpost recovered from the attack researching the lorespeakers notes became a priority and a few more pieces of information were discovered enough to potentially piece together a cleansing ritual however the rare reagents sighted by serai hunters were never found and it is unknown how their loss will impact the success of the anticorruption research click here for pictures of the event story info  preevent summary far removed the current political maneuvering to the south life goes on as winter begins to fade away to the spring thaw with the post war resettlement of civilians from clan grimward clan ironmound has decided to stand up several new packs the newly formed pack stonesong has been sent to settle and rebuild hazemane village which was occupied by grimward forces during this recent conflict hazemane village is located in northern ironmound territory and has a history as a producer of forest products the village was a hub for charcoal and timber production and produced a large crop of mushrooms annually it was most likely due to the large stores of burnable materials that the grimward forces set hazemane village as a staging area for corpses waiting to be burned on the weekly mass pyers due to the smell the majority of the local grimward forces avoided the area and the village escaped with mostly superficial damage although the same cannot be said of its residents with the cold weather of winter the corpse smell is expected to be unnoticeable at the time of your projected arrival  gustave ironmound clanleader of clan ironmound has put out a call for all able hands to assist in the reconstruction of hazemane village he has promised a boon of silver to any willing to assist to be paid upon completion of reconstruction additional bonus payment may be available to skilled laborers blacksmiths and those able to deal with the possibility of lingering corruption from the concentration of grimward corpses while the daughters see to their final disposition primary focus is to be given to rebuilding the charcoal and timber exports as the charcoal is needed to produce new steel and the timber for new buildings and to assist the village leaders with any of their needs postevent summary after coordinating with the local chieftain and setting out with a wagon loaded with supplies a large group of adventurers and members of various groups accompanied the chieftains villagers to their new village they arrived without incident and found the village to be largely intact and with plenty of room to expand work began immediately as the villagers the daughters of gaia and the chieftain himself began to divide up some of the work that needed to be done buildings were cleared metal was worked in a forge wood was chopped or blasted with magic and brought to the furnaces that were cleaned and started classes were being led by instructors on divine magic and martial skills improving the overall skill sets of the village the village was well on schedule perhaps ahead of schedule to get reestablished this is when sightings of the mordok were brought to the chieftain first only a few of them then a few more soon the mordok were seen in fairly large numbers nearby and then word came in that a corruption site was found by some adventurers the mordok were either avoided or repelled without much incident but as night began to settle in the mordok arrived in force and it was quickly learned that this group of mordok was no ordinary hunting group they were organized they were communicating effectively with each other they demonstrated sound tactics based on survival and even implemented group hitandrun and shieldwall tactics their ferocity continued to increase and the entire village was on high alert to watch the defenses protect the villagers and repel the attacks a daring group even went out to attempt to find and destroy the site of corruption stumbling upon a mordok shaman conducting a ritual although the shaman was killed it had alerted others nearby and any cleansing efforts to the site were in vain as the corruption itself spread to those who attempted to cleanse it barely retreating in time news of this rare and new corruption was brought back to the village the attacks lasted for what seemed like hours and then word reached the village that some of the adventurers had been captured dragged to the sight of corruption and ritualistically corrupted by their shamans and some even maimed and tortured any attempts to cleanse this corruption merely stalled its affects for a short time and clerics who attempted to help by transmuting wounds from fallen warriors found themselves also tainted by the corruption the village chieftain and the adventurers had to choose stay and endure the attacks to protect the village or to leave under escort and try to reach safety as the wounds and corruption began to pile up among those present it was decided that the village would be defended whether this was because there was more profit to be had in saving the village the morality of the group helped sway the choice to help hazemane village or there were enough wounds and rent armor to make traversing out of the area too dangerous is unknown the attacks continued into the night and then suddenly ceased the mordok completely gone from the area scouts went to the site of corruption all idols were gone and the taint of lingering corruption was still present but no longer as strong the mordok simply vanished dawn finally arrived as the village of hazemane was saved from destruction and the villagers were reinforced by the rest of the pack gustavs contract was paid out to all those that assisted but everyone involved in the previous nights event were left with a sense of dread the mordok have returned in force and have brought with them a new type of corruption that resists any previous known cleansing whether a cleansing rite will be found that can cure this corruption before it drains the life essence from those afflicted and eventually kills them remains to be seen click here for photos from the event story info  preevent summary several months after the armistice meeting and signing of the treaty between clan nightriver and clan grimward the fighting across mardrun has come to a stop warriors return home to their villages and settlements unsure of the status of the civil war and if their allies are still fighting the speed at which this treaty was signed and the onset of the full winters cold was enough to shock the clans and get them to stop for now blades may be sheathed but words and tempers flare as allies to both grimward and nightriver express concern or anger towards the dealings of this treaty some feel it is unfair but may be convinced to back down and others seem intent on refusing and continuing the aggression clan stromjarl has been vocal and made it public that at this time they are not agreeing to this treaty saying that to do so would abandon the lands and the people conquered by clan grimward rumors and whispers from other clans and colonies continue as the continent holds its breath to see what happens next at the heart of all this is clan nightriver who has recently called for a meeting in allied territory if grimward agrees to the treaty signed then supplies and honor bound ulven are being shifted to their lands nightriver has been given these reparations from grimward and there is talk about how to share those spoils of war with the allies that were involved a number of allies to clan nightriver are intent on approaching the clanleader or his representatives to ask or demand for honored payment or reparation the clanleader has agreed to meet with some representatives of each clan and major colony personally but has established a secondary meeting for other allies the ravens district of the colony of newhope was asked to host this meeting a representative andor skald from clan nightriver is being sent to this meeting in order to meet with a number of allies and participants that fought and helped during the ulven civil war coalition members and allies are traveling to this meeting to state their case and present information to the nightriver representative in order to receive their fair share of these reparations whether by hawk courier representative or in person representation from numerous factions groups and individual people involved in the war are coming to speak their piece attendees will have the chance to speak their involvement or their groups involvement and be considered for fair payment there is also talk about the groups meeting and discussing the future of the entity known as the coalition only a name currently the coalition has lacked the leadership needed to make it any kind of true organization and the members of this group must decide whether it is time to build this group under a common goal and solidify the coalition or to abandon it for individual agendas post event summary as the guests to the dinner ate and talked the meeting began and those that had claim to reparations were asked to stand and address all assembled a varying amount of claims were made from long term involvement to boasts of aid and combat prowess on the battlefield a few letters were read from representatives of clan stormjarl and new aldoria that shocked some of those present clan stormjarl openly disagreeing with the treaty had a letter delivered that detailed their refusal to sign the treaty and their intent to continue to fighting against clan grimward not only that but terms were delivered to clan nightriver from clan stormjarl penned by the clanleader graytir himself these requests were forwarded onward to branthur the scope of the requests too large for the meeting nonetheless the openness of stormjarls stance and their forceful nature in delivered terms to continue the alliance had many worried new aldorias letter of address stated that they would not sign the treaty one that cut out such a large ally such as clan stormjarl these claims were heard and considered and after they were made the nightriver representative and her skald took recess with their economical and political advisers to come to an agreed amount of payment once they returned awards were given in response to new aldorias letter the clan nightriver representative awarded nothing to new aldoria which was shocking to those assembled and could bring ill favor to the alliance that new aldoria has with clan nightriver after the meeting was concluded there was talk among the group about trying to reform the coalition into something that is a tangible entity not just merely a convenient title with no power it was met both with agreement and concern and talks about several different types of treaties and alliances took place as well as the civil war dies down the political and diplomat lines appear to be drawn all across mardrun click here for pictures from the event story info  preevent summary with the war officially winding down and the two armies heading home for the rest of the winter news has reached the coalition and nightriver allies of a village on the edge of watchwolf and ironmound territory recently overrun by grimward forces it was apparently used as a supply storage and rumors say it still contains a large amount of food and supplies that were taken from nearby clan ironmound villages in grimwards haste they abandoned the village during their retreat but will most likely be returning to retake the supplies  a bold plan is being devised to go and take these spoils of war before grimward collects them and return them to allies or keep them for personal gain there is a legitimate claim that these supplies are open for the taking since they were most likely stolen from numerous villages or brought in as part of the grimward supply line these supplies will either need a coordinated effort or multiple wagons and dragsleds in order to take away from the village some are concerned that whoever owns the village may lay claim to the supplies and there may be others attempting to take it as well as the deep freeze of winter finally settles in the need for food will make these supplies precious and worth quite a bit to numerous other settlements postevent summary after rough traveling through the recent hard packed snowfall the group of coalition members and others that tagged along arrived at the location of the village discussions of how the group would handle the spoils and how the work would be divided up common along the way upon arriving at the village it was clear something was amiss inside the village were armed men some with expensive armor and equipment bearing no flags or heraldry at first they claimed they owned the village but it was soon discovered that they were not the owner of the village negotiations began as the armed group inside the village eagerly sought after the wagon that the coalition members had brought with them shortly after that a group of ulven approached the coalitions wagon and introduced themselves as the villagers of oakbrook they claimed that the armed men took over their village and refused to leave discussion erupted into violence as they were driven back from the village the villagers pleaded with the coalition members to help them retake their village so that their people could come back to their homes driven away during the civil war these villagers were trying to help their people survive and reorganize their village  a series of discussions and negotiations took place as the armed men in the village refused to hand over the supplies without striking a deal and they claimed that the villagers were spinning lies back and forth the discussions went until finally the coalition group organized and decided to help the villagers hard terms were delivered to the armed men of the village who turned out to be soldiers of davens reach they were to leave and would be given a small share as a token of appreciation an argument erupted and escalated into a fight as the coalition members and the villagers allied together and attacked the soldiers of davens reach a brief but fierce fight broke out resulting in the soldiers being driven from the village curses and shouts of retribution were given by some of the surviving davens reach members but the coalition stood firm in their decision to drive them out and help the villagers fallen soldiers were given mercy and their wounds tended to some of them even deciding to help the coalition or some of those that tagged along with the small caravan some of the soldiers were killed in the fight however so worry about how davens reach will respond was heard being discussed among the coalition members with the fighting over the coalition members made good on their deal to leave supplies for the villagers so that they may feed their people through the winter and even left more supplies than what was agreed upon the villagers were pleased knowing they can rebuild and help their people survive the winter the remaining spoils of war were loaded into the wagons or carried on the backs of those present and taken south to rejoin with allies moving back towards colony territory story  preevent summary after the recent uneasy alliance with ironmound still under negotiations nightriver has begun to mobilize more of its warriors to send them to the frontlines branthur nightriver has sent multiple messages urging his allies the colonies and the coalition to take advantage of this opportunity and push for an end to the war military units and supply wagons have begun marching to purpose and the civil war continues to escalate some fear to a bloody and brutal confrontation and others hope for a chance to stall the fighting and find a peaceful resolution far to the north members of the coalition have gathered again at onsallas outpost the pineed sap harvest is winding down but numerous trees are still able to produce enough sap to be collected villagers of pack longfang and onsallas village have begun a coordinated effort to explore the nearby swamp and territories for any and all supplies that could be collected and sent to the war effort mordok activity is on the rise but remain far enough away to not be a direct threat and merchants and adventurers have begun to visit onsallas again during the ironmound feast wargah grimward revealed to everyone in attendance that clan grimward was also in possession of an ulven orb an artifact identical to the one found in the swamp last year members of the coalition fear that it is now a race against time to see which side of the civil war unlocks the secrets behind the ulven artifact postevent summary as adventurers and travels from all across mardrun collected at onsallas outpost basic tasks and outpost defenses were divided up dry firewood was sought after and pineed trees ready for tapping were searched for in order to collect sap from the recent harvest swamp tack and supplies were collected and moved for the war effort with a collection being taken by those who wanted to send more support mad morty and the shepherd were sighted and even made an attempt to get close to the corruption site outside the outpost mordok activity continued all through the day as adventurers tried to unlock the secrets of the ulven orb it eventually did activate once a nearby corruption idol was destroyed and the orb recalled two adventurers through the mana stream and into the swamp a search party was sent out and the two were found who apparently were recalled to a specific point upon digging into the ground a cache was found containing some magical artifacts and notes from what appears to be a lorespeaker in the cache was a well known saga and what appeared to be the original which featured ulven battling each other the implication of the history of the ulven was profound but more questions needed answers the mordok continued to be a real threat and the adventurers manned the defenses research continued on the materials recovered and hints and notes pointed towards a great mystery further west in the swamp click here for pictures of the event story  preevent summary after recent aggression reached its peak in the western watchwolf settlement the neighboring clan ironmound has become the focus of attention in the ulven civil war the clans territory borders clan shattered spear and the pass in the great wolfs hackles and is home to many highly defendable locations and large amounts of high quality steel for a year clan ironmound has expressed concern that they wish to remain neutral in the larger ulven conflict their representatives have traveled and been host to several delegates from other clans and it seems that the clans allegiance is highly sought after by both clan grimward and clan nightriver clan grimwards aggression and conquest of clan stormjarl territory to the south and the watchwolf clans settlement nearby have shown ironmound how neutral clans are treated with the impending decision of clan ironmound in the near future the ambassadors and leaders of their ruling elder council have decided to hold a feast and invite representatives from clan nightriver the coalition and clan grimward hawks have been sent to these groups detailing a day and a location one of the settlements near the great wolfs hackles this meeting could decide the allegiance of clan ironmound in the ulven civil war and could potentially be a major turning point for either side postevent summary representatives from almost all the factions of the coalition joined clan nightriver and clan grimward to attend a feast held on neutral ground in ironmound territory as guests entered the area they were a bit unsettled by grimwards display of force camped within shouting distance were two well supplied and apparently well armed war packs of clan grimward they had camped nearby as part of the escort to wargah grimward the representative to clan grimward who was the daughter of haygreth grimward tension filled the feasting hall as wargah and her guards took one side of the hall and the coalition and clan nightriver took the other side of the hall as the feast took place tension eased a bit as everyone in attendance was glad to have a break from the fighting grimward and members of the coalition even had discussions that remained amicable and everyone was a bit relieved at how the feast was progressing however a different kind of battle was taking place and representatives from all sides of the war were doing a lot of discussions on involvement and what it would mean ironmound has long since stood for neutrality but grimward was applying a lot of pressure to make them join their cause this was furthered by the discussions of wargah but many of the ironmound fears were eased when reports of the watchwolf defenders being shown mercy and even being cared for after the watchwolves were conquered this gave them hope that their people would be spared if a decision had to be made on the other hand the representatives from the coalitions factions and of clan nightriver had talks with the ironmound council of elders as well sharing stories of their defenses of other neutral clans and how grimward has treated others and refused to listen to reason they expressed many details about the war offered aid where they could and continued to push the stance that neutrality should be a choice for any clan in this conflict instead of just pushing ironmound to choose clan nightrivers side one of the ironmound elders had a son present that was afflicted by headaches and dreams and members of the coalition assisted the young man and even offered to provide aid to him regardless of the decision made by ironmound many in attendance were worried if the coalition guests were respecting their hosts and acting the way they were expected to and several negative interactions with the ironmound elders made many worry about how it would influence their decisions the council of elders were conflicted on their decisions seeing merit in both sides of the war and in neutrality at first they discussed then debated and then flat out argued over the options presented it seemed like there was a large rift between the council of elders present in at the feast and in ironmound territory if the elders cannot come to an agreement on a decision then the clanleader must become involved in the heat of the moment one of the elders made a bold move after arguing audibly in front of the guests in the dinner this procoalition elder drew his sword and asked the coalition to stand with him after his opposing progrimward elder argued that taking a stance in the war especially with the coalition was not the right choice those present sprang into action and weapons were drawn the room suddenly threatening to erupt into violence wargah grimward then used magic to recall the progrimward ironmound elder out of danger rescuing him after he expressed fear of being present leaving her guards to the mercy of the room a member of the coalition attacked the grimward guards breaking the neutral ground the feast was on and forcing the decision even further for clan ironmound luckily the violence was halted as fast as it began and none of the grimward were killed in the fight they were allowed to leave and were not stopped and they ran to their encampment as soon as they left the building in a flurry of activity those present at the dinner came up with a plan to have most of their groups escort the clan nightriver representative to her encampment to link up with her warriors and for one group to escort the remaining ironmound elders and their followers to the nearby ironmound village the entire group quickly left the building and the plan worked clan nightriver warriors were alerted and able to regroup at the village and the ironmound reps arrived safely the coalition rejoiced in this victory having earned another ally to stand against grimward but were fearful of the well armed grimward war packs that would surely pursue them to the village the grimward camp packed up quickly and to everyones surprise marched south spurred on as if driven by some new purpose and avoided the village entirely once the excitement settled down the ironmound rep became concerned and worried for he knew that he made a grave mistake in forcing a decision for the council at the feast he was worried about the repercussions of the clanleader who heavily favored neutrality in this conflict and spoke to several that he advised the coalition be prepared to do whatever is necessary to gain his favor and secure the new alliance the clan nightriver representative was also worried knowing that unless acted upon quickly the alliance with ironmound could be lost and their clan ending up joining grimward now that the option of neutrality is no longer available to the clan as she attached a hastily written letter to the leg of a messenger hawk and let it fly south to clan nightriver territory she made it very clear that this very moment and the decisions the coalition makes in response to this is critical failing to secure this alliance could be the tipping point in the war click here for pictures from the event we also did a photoshoot at devils lake state park after the event too which are included story  pre event summary the northern half of mardrun is a flurry of activity as the spring thaw begins to set in and the cold embrace of winter begins to recede the watchwolf clan has endured the harsh winter just barely with food supplies running low and fear and worry spreading through its populace the fighting from over a year ago was harsh on the watchwolves their farms were pillaged their outer villages burned or captured their warriors beaten through attrition against a larger foe although the coalition and clan nightriver allies were critical in keeping the watchwolves from losing their last main settlement the victory that turned the grimward conquerors back would only stall them for a time when last years crop season produced meager food supplies and warriors were drafted from the young and desperate grimward was always there on the edge of the territory waiting a dark reminder that the watchwolf clan was never truly safe the coalition and other allies to the south have provided aid but numerous battles raids and different agendas stalled or pushed back any concentrated effort to help the watchwolves rebuild or fortify their borders desertion and fear began to spread through the settlements but honor pride and constant reminders of the watchwolves sacred duty to protect their lands against a shrouded prophecy kept them from fleeing in large numbers the clans leaders work hard to control the people to steel them for the battle to come and remind every member of the clan to remain steadfast and to do their duty every able bodied watchwolf some barely of age enough to see their marks come in is given a weapon and sent to join the war packs stationed around the settlements  the recession of winter normally a joyous occasion is now a sign that battle is here clan grimwards forces spent the winter preparing supplies and amassing warriors on their northern borders drunk on tales of battle and promise of conquest now they mobilize and renew their campaign to conquer the watchwolf clan hundreds of warriors cross the border and move on the remaining watchwolf settlements spurred on after long months of waiting and preparation allies to the watchwolves fear that their pride and stubborn ways could spell disaster to its people that an organized evacuation to their eastern settlement could spare the watchwolves hundreds of lives but without an attempt to sway their leaders it will be hard to convince them of this rumors also spread that the high priestess of the watchwolves has been in discussion about surrendering or joining clan grimward in the civil war the coalition and clan nightriver have sent forces north to secure the pass and help in whatever way they can but with the pass no longer garrisoned by the militant clerics of the order of arnaths fist it is now a race against time to see who will control such a vital route through the great wolfs hackles postevent summary a group of coalition members were able to slip past the grimward warriors that moved to the pass and the soldiers that marched to the pass were locked in conflict with them for control of the area upon arriving to the watchwolf settlement a battle was already underway but with reinforcements the watchwolf defenders were able to hold as the coalition allies coordinated with the watchwolves in the area it was clear that there was discord among the watchwolves a young chieftain who wanted to look out for the survival of his people was following the commands of an older watchwolf ambassador it was obvious the ambassador was there to instill courage into the hearts of the watchwolf defenders and to keep them from fleeing from the fight after a few brief skirmishes khulgar graytide made his presence known to the defenders in the area and approached via parlay to deliver terms of surrender written by haygreth grimward quarter and honorable surrender were given to any ulven who stopped fighting and joined clan grimward the defenders and their allies refused remaining stalwart in their defense of the settlement the fighting died down ominously before signal horns were heard in the distance the watchwolf clanleader finally gave the signal to move all remaining defenders into the settlement to hold out as long as they could the settlement was a chaotic swirl of supplies that needed to be recovered before they were lost to the enemy pockets of fighting and swirling melees with warriors on both sides signalling reinforcements and reformations of their skirmish lines and of civilians both rescued by watchwolf defenders and their coalition allies and being captured by grimward invaders in the beginning the watchwolf line was pushed back hard and the situation looked grim but with the combined skill and equipment of the coalition allies they were able to hold out far longer than the defenders thought possible wave after wave of grimward defenders crashed on the defenders but were driven back or repelled enough to stop grimwards advance on that part of the settlement the rest of the settlement wasnt doing as well and the battle looked hopeless it was only a matter of time before grimward conquered the entire settlement inside the defenders line the discord that was brewing between the chieftain and the ambassador reached a bloody end as the ambassador was wounded in battle after hours of urging the watchwolf defenders to leave and save their people the ambassador was murdered by someone amongst the watchwolves or the coalition what was certain is that it was an ally what is unknown is exactly who it was and it is suspected that the coalition had a hand in it the young chieftain no longer bound to obey the word of the ambassador made the decision to save as many people as possible and to evacuate and head south to the pass the remaining defenders villagers and wagons full of supplies departed the settlement after a stubborn defense that would not yield to grimward the settlement was quickly taken by the invaders as the caravan left nobody left to stop the grimward from advanding into the heart of the settlement the chieftain was devastated by having made the choice he had wondering if saving his people but leaving the settlement to fall was the best choice in the end the caravan was followed by grimward invaders but due to the brave sacrifice of a few and the coordinated retreat by the rest the caravan was able to leave the fighting area safely however several members of the factions present took a number of supplies from the caravan with them instead of delivering them safely to the watchwolves which was viewed poorly by the remaining watchwolf refugees the caravan reached the pass safely allowing the chieftain to escort his people home to their eastern settlement click this link for pictures of the event story  pre event summary the colony of newhope leaders

were paid to cause trouble no one knows the real source of the employer but whispers point towards someone on the council itself celestial aragonnes dispatched a representative on behalf of the council who was to review the state of crows landing and see if this situation could be resolved when the roads were finally cleared it appears a number of negotiations had taken place between multiple factions and representatives pictures of the event httplasthopelarpwikispacescomdecember132c2014crow27slandingandgreatforestsearchevent scenario 2 the forest hunt disturbing news has come from the great forest  with the winters fall on the continent of mardrun the mordok have grown even more active and they seem to be growing bolder attempting to strike fear into the hearts of the ulven who call mardrun their home recent attacks have seemed smarter more dangerous  and worst of all targeted against highranking figures it seems that the mordok are interested in something in the great forest and its up to you to figure out what youre part of an ulven hunting party who is planning on meeting up with another patrol inside of the great forest who claim to have some important information and then tracking the movements and activities of the mordok post event deep in the great forest the hunting party traveled to meet with another group of ulven hunters upon arrival at an old abandoned village they found a scene where a battle recently took place but the only surviving ulven was a lorespeaker after searching the village the hunting party found more scenes of mordok strange carvings and markings on the doors of the buildings and several brutally tortured and maimed corpses it was soon discovered that the mordok in the area were being led by mad morty the pirate captain who become corrupted by the magics of the swamp a negotiation took place between the lorespeaker and mad morty the pirate would hand over a journal that was in the possession of the hunting party that was killed in exchange for decoding some ancient ulven texts however once the deal was complete the mordok attacked and gave chase throughout the forest the ulven hunting party was able to stay together and fall back and leave the area but almost half of their number were overrun and torn apart by mordok due to nightlow light conditions we do not have pictures of this eventas winter fast approaches all across mardrun reports are heard of the civil war peaking as grimward forces are seen in watchwolf territory and clan stormjarl fights back against the grimward conquerors in their lands on the eastern side of the continent the raids against clan whiteoak have begun in full clan axhound war packs raid into whiteoak territory assisted by allies other coalition members and a number of smaller axhound war packs raid against prime targets deeper in clan whiteoak territory these attacks are bold and daring favoring clan axhounds aggressive fighting style but lack the command and leadership of some of the more experienced warleaders this close to winter aggression against whiteoak is unlikely to be stopped or hindered by clan grimward some of whiteoaks war packs are also still in grimward territory but rumor has it that the whiteoak warleader has been recalling his warriors back home over the fall season the coalition has a large chance to deal a major blow against the largest ally to clan grimward however clan whiteoak is famed for its hearty warriors and berserkers and generations of fighting near the dirge swamp has made them a formidable clan a year of fighting against clan stormjarl has honed their skills for war the coalition may find themselves able to cripple grimwards allies and even retrieve some spoils of war for themselves or they could find themselves isolated with little to no supplies in an enemy clans territory against a fierce opponent the first few raids on clan whiteoak could heavily impact their involvement in the rest of the ulven civil war  as the raiding caravan approached the location of the outposts they were going to attack a camp location needed to be picked finding a small path out of sight from hunters the caravan set up its wagons and supplies and built a fire in the woods the situation was somber and dire if the camp was discovered too soon the outposts would be alerted or reinforced and much harder to raid the raiding party led by a clan axhound representative and made up primarily of coalition members scouted out the area and established patrols the group was split into two each group was to raid a different outpost to do as much damage to clan whiteoak in the area as possible the first raid was succcessful the defenders of the whiteoak outpost being overrun after a quick and intense fight the second raid was still successful but the raiding party sustained more injuries and less equipment to deal with the second outpost upon returning to the camp the defenses were still intact and the raiding party was waiting for nightfall before making an attempt to travel to the crossroads this crossroad was a critical choke point for all wagon and cart travel in the area and the whiteoak knew it the raiding party split in half and the first group was able to overrun or drive back the whiteoak warriors that were holding the crossroads they made it out of the area and back to the axhound allies further south the second group waited until after dark and had to protect the camp from numerous whiteoak hunting parties giving the first group time to escape the raiding party held but injuries and broken equipment were stacking up and soon the situation would be dire the group packed up covered the campfire and made for the crossroads after being ambushed twice by whiteoak hunting parties the raiding party was split up in the chaos of the combat at night after some short but intense fights the remaining wagons and supplies were able to make it to and through the crossroads the success of the raids on both outposts the supplies looted as spoils of the raids and the wagons and carts being protected allowed the coalition to strike a heavy blow against clan whiteoak and their

there are always a few hunters roaming around but any larger tribe movements have not been around for quite some time many see this as a bad omen especially after the appearance of the red eyed syndar earlier in the year and the corruption that spread to a number of people in the area the site where the red eyed syndar performed a powerful ritual still seeps corruption from the ground threatening to expand and has been exhausting some of the pack longfang daughters of gaia as they attempt to contain or slow it down the outpost is alive with hunters and warriors coming and going and the upcoming raid on clan whiteoak territory has dominated the campfire conversations clan axhound has launched their attack and the coalition on mardrun is expected to assist them to gain their allegiance some are hesitant to commit to a full attack and others are excited feeling that this is finally a way to make a difference in the current conflict other rumors trickle in from merchants and travelers showing that the civil war continues on throughout mardrun travelers continue to come and go despite the dirge swamp being a dangerous place the allure of profit is hard to ignore by merchants and those who can take advantage of the large pineed sap harvests of pack longfang and the exotic herbs and reagents the swamp has to offer the ulven artifact that was unburied earlier this year continues to be a mystery its exact nature function and how to activate it have not yet been discovered while some work feverishly to understand it and unlock its secrets some of the more traditional ulven in the area believe it was buried for a reason and should not be tampered with lightly after a merchant arrives with his mercenary guards it is soon discovered that the caravan he intended to meet never arrived mordok had been sited in the woods and upon searching the trails it was soon discovered that the wagon caravan was ambushed the site was a slaughter entrails blood and maimed limbs were left everywhere near the remaining wagon closer examination of the site showed that the ambush was not typical of the mordoks actions the killing much more brutal with more torture and dismemberment than usual a darker intelligence guided them during this raid but no further information was discovered the brotherhood of the long winters caravan arrived back at the outpost a mass pilgrimage of people these hearty colonists and former richtcrag warriors came to discuss alliances with pack longfang and to converse with the other coalition and faction leaders the outpost was a stopping point before venturing further west the brotherhood intending to colonize the neutral territory north of clan shattered spear in the outpost a ceremony was conducted for stanrick longfang to become the first chieftain or pack longfang all who could be called ally and friend were welcome to witness the ceremony soon after the funeral pyre of a clanleader was seen burning in the distance to the west a sign that the clan shattered spear clanleader had died presumably in battle during a raid against mordok in the dirge swamp after hunting down and killing several mordok mordok activity in

expedition set out to search for more clues a large group of adventurers from several factions led by a pack longfang guide gathered some supplies and set out north from the onsallas outpost their destination was to search for the ruins of the failed settlement of pack blackwing the expedition was stalked and attacked by numerous mordok groups the attacks were frequent as more mordok in the area gravitated to the expedition the combined efforts of the warriors and archers could barely keep the mordok from overrunning the group and the constant battles began to take their toll a few members of the expedition were killed and carried off a small detachment of order of arnaths fist members ended up returning to the onsallas outpost after one of their lions a veteran battle cleric was killed in the melee without strong leadership and a mix of mercenaries and different groups making up the group the lack of cohesion in the expedition became a dangerous flaw as the lack of supplies and the wounds became a dire situation for the expedition a few members continued to scan the swamp and look for anything useful the old pack blackwing outpost was found but had to be abandoned quickly as some form of corruption in the outpost began to influence the people who stayed there for too long a few small items and some papers were found but it looked as if there was nothing of use in the outpost later in the day a few scouts for the expedition came across a camp hidden in the woods after investigating it appeared to be another camp built by the syndar who had written the original journal another piece was discovered but it was only partially translated before the mordok attacked and forced the expedition to retreat with the second journal discovered there was evidence that another camp lay deeper into the dirge swamp due to the lack of veteran warriors in the group the lack of supplies and the accumulation of wounds and broken equipment the expedition was forced to return to the onsallas outpost or risk being overrun by the mordok unless another expedition is put together any further clues about the mysterious syndar or the corruption idols are now

warriors there a small garrison of vandregon soldiers helped with the outposts defenses as several groups such as the phoenix syndar and adventurers patrolled the nearby swamp and looked for reagents pineed sap fae leaves and moonflowers were all picked and gathered to help the war effort the quartermaster of pack longfangs outpost coordinated these reagents and gathered hunters to volunteer to send the reagents to the pass with so much pineed sap harvested and refined the warriors in the pass could be saved if the hunters could carry it to them quickly the daughters of gaia and witches in the onsallas village sent ominous reports of some sort of disturbance in the nearby area of the swamp fearing another corruption idol was nearby a group was sent out to find this location after several daughters used their magic to divine its location a mordok camp with a powerful idol was discovered unable to destroy the idol by themselves request from the village was answered and a complex and potent cleaning ritual was handed over to the group in the outpost after being deciphered preparations were made to begin cleansing the site and making the necessary reagents to finish the cleansing during the following day mordok continued to roam the area in small packs picking at small groups or fleeing into the swamp several groups going out to find reagents and interact with a strange black skinned syndar were ambushed with hit and run tactics along with the known corruption idol a strange syndar journal was discovered and the exact identity of the black skinned syndar is still unknown the following day a large group of adventurers moved into the swamp and protected the final steps of the cleansing ritual the idols powerful influence was dispelled but there was some heated discussion whether the idol should then be destroyed or taken back and studied it was decided that the idol would be taken back to the outpost and researched click here for pictures of the eventwith the watchwolf and longfang warriors in the pass low on supplies and losing the battle with attrition a call for help and supplies was sent out a lesser noble in the colony volunteered to put together a caravan with healing supplies and food and get it into the pass he hired adventurers as bodyguards and began the long trek to the great wolfs hackles the caravan began with a slow start as all the supplies needed inventorying and the creation of several travois carriers was necessary canvas rope and wood were all lashed together to make simple carrying devices and the convoy began to move it was clear that mordok activity was heavy in the area as several small raiding parties picked at the caravan guards as they moved along the trail supplies and reagents were gathered along the way as adventurers dared to break away from the group and search the surrounding area the caravan eventually came to a stop outside of an abandoned village and the mordok in the area were relentless several adventurers stumbled into the main mordok camp and some of the idols on display there were taken wave after wave of mordok assaulted the caravan and threatened to overwhelm the defenders the healer that accompanied the caravan setup a healing station for the wounded and was forced to use a majority of the potent healing reagents just to keep the bodyguards alive the travois which had broken down and needed repair was abandoned and the group split into two supplies were scooped up or a simple canvas drag was created and the caravan left the area with whatever supplies they could carry eventually both groups were able to reach the pass in the hackles but almost all of the guards were badly injured and most of the reagents were used the badly needed supplies and healing reagents did not arrive in enough quantity or good condition to help the watchwolf and longfang defenders in the pass disease and infection began to set in as the wounds on the warriors in the pass began to worsenthe civil war between the ulven rages on and several key battles took place around mardrun the mountain pass a team of watchwolf clan and pack longfang warriors moved to the mountain pass that runs through the middle of the great wolfs hackles several clan grimward camps were established to hold the pass to try and cut off reinforcements from the newhope colony and clan nightriver to the south the team struck quickly and overwhelmed encampments and killed all of the grimward warriors there the fighting was going well until several signal horns were blown alerting some of the patrolling grimwards in the area they rushed to the pass to help out the camps and counter attacked the watchwolf and longfang warriors brutal and heavy fighting broke out as shield walls clashed and warriors picked each other apart the veteran warriors of the watchwolves and longfangs outmatched the clan grimward warriors and casualties were a minimum with only two deaths in contrast clan grimward suffered close to eighty casualties after the fighting stopped numerous watchwolf and longfang warriors were terribly wounded and unable to continue fighting but the pass was taken from clan grimward raid on watchwolf lands khulgar graytide and his elite pack graytide warriors led an attack on watchwolf lands to the north a small village was overwhelmed and quickly destroyed all the village militia and guards killed in the frenzy of clan grimwards assault an organized defense was created at the next village and both sides tried to exchange terms and insults as they moved into position khulgar offered the defenders a chance to surrender but it was stoically refused lycon graytide led the charge into the village and a fierce fight broke out many warriors were slain by both sides as the fighting continued to wear on in the end clan grimard pushed the defenders out of the village but only after taking a serious beating and losing many warriors in the process clan grimward now has a firm foothold in watchwolf territory but had to pay for every inch with blood stopping an alliance a strike team of ulven and colonists was formed and sent deep into enemy lines to try and intercept and kill a clan grimward chieftan who was on his way to discuss terms of surrender with clan stormjarl the team slipped passed grimward lines under the cover of darkness and coordinated their attack when the grimward camp was ambushed the attackers soon learned that their was no chieftan but instead of an influencial daughter of gaia and her retinue fearing political backlash for murdering an important daughter the fighting halted as both groups tried to discuss it out grimward warriors were sworn to protect the daughter of gaia and wished to drive out the attackers but the daughter insisted on talking it out a lone coywolf hunter calmed the situation saying that the war is not what it seems and that the colonists have complied with ulven wishes the daughter agreed to discuss the matter in detail with the coywolf who was then knocked out by a grimward guard and bound the fighting broke out again as grimward guards began to drive the attackers out a small team was able to return and slip back across into friendly territory but a large number of clan nightriver volunteers were killed or captured during the fightas the cold winter snow fell through the sky the gathered group of adventurers entered the great dining hall of the watchwolves of luna under watchwolf and longfang protection the people gathered in the hall we invited to a feast to celebrate the victory over the undead plague on mardrun and to learn more about the cultures of the different groups the guests socialized and talked with the phoenix syndar setting up a merchant table a human dancer entertaining the others and the warriors of the longfangs and watchwolves singing hearty songs about ulven mead as dinner was served an ulven story teller opened up the floor to the telling of tales and sharing of stories several volunteers entertained the guests by contributing to the stories a story of note that was told was the ballad of venator dreadfang detailing his life and his sacrifice to kill the lich messenger hawks continued to arrive with letters to different factions and people most of them were praise for such great work and others pledges of support or updates the festivities were interrupted as two guests confronted magrat of the longfangs about her barbaric flesh eating customs this caused a stir as one of them claimed to be of the order and threatened that she would report to her superiors the tense moment was defused as the longfangs stood by their outsider member and the watchwolves reminded everyone that other races and cultures have their own unique customs raskolf of the watchwolves sent hunters to stop her from leaving so they could talk and was able to potentially avoid a situation the last two messages received by hawk was an anonymous letter calling out the ulven as domestic dogs and hinted at venator dreadfangs betrayals in the past the final message was sent by none other than haygreth grimward himself sarcastically applauding raskolf for his work with the colonists in the letter haygreth grimward subtly promised war against the western watchwolves of luna the dinner ended with a final thank you from raskolf in his ending remarks he reminded everyone that in his grim time everyone needs to stand by one another and accept them and work together as comradesafter the gravestone was discovered in the dirge swamp near onsallas outpost the coalition of factions moved to destroy it distracted by an attack led by the order of arnaths fist on the lich itself the group was able to destroy the gravestone with the stone destroyed the lich fled and moved southwest along the coast moving past watchwolf territory it destroyed several small ulven settlements and villages and converted the slain into zombies closely following it were the combined forces of the order of arnaths fist the new vandregon soldiers and ulven from several packs such as clan nightriver pack longfang and the watchwolves clan wherever the lich spread the undead plague it was rooted out and destroyed by the clerics of the order and the ulven daughters of gaia with the lich pushing deeper into clan grimward territory the coalition forces had to move quickly before clan grimward responded to the trespass and moved to stop them they would have one last chance to close in on the lich and finish it before being cut off in enemy territory and the lich disappearing joining the coalition during the final attack were the phoenix syndar a nomadic group that has lived on an island south the continent the phoenix added healer and magic support to the groups already potent magical presence of the order clerics and daughters of gaia the veteran members of the phoenix and the order would conduct a complicated ritual maykar in origin to channel the recently discovered paladin blade the ritual if successful would allow someone to wield it and channel their life force into the blade and create a powerful divine weapon this weapon would be strong enough to finish the lich but would take all of the life force of the wielder destroying the lich would sacrifice the life of the one who destroyed it as the large group set off to pursue a group of ulven of the watchwolves and the longfangs broke off to push deeper into grimward territory clan grimward responded to the trespass into their territory by sending a hunting party of warriors to attack the group the group led by raskolf of the watchwolves left to delay or stop the attack the lich had to be contained or cornered so that the ritual could be conducted the group pursued the lich fighting it as it fled after combing through the last few villages the lich was cornered in a large abandoned lumberyard the coalition split their group and trapped it with members of the ulven packs and the soldiers of vandregon taking the brunt of the fighting against the lich meanwhile a few clerics and the phoenix syndar secured the other entrance and began the ritual the time needed to complete the ritual was paid for in the blood of vandregon and ulven warriors several falling to the foul lich magic several other ulven and humans were bitten and infected venator oathkeeper one of the last surviving members of clan dreadfang volunteered to be the wielder of the maykar paladin blade the ritual was completed by a combined effort of ulven human and syndar magic while the warriors kept the lich and his zombies at bay knowing what the outcome was venator never hesitated when taking the charged blade giving into the power of the weapon and channeling his rage and essence into the weapon venator lead the final charge against the lich chanting the final incantation of the ritual members of the phoenix order vandregon and their ulven allies charged with venator to give him the time he needed to fight the lich as the blade landed struck the lichs body the power channeled through it and obliterated the lich with a thunder clap that stunned all around it and withered the zombies nearby to lifeless corpses the battle fell silent an eerie calm fell across the battlefield the only sound that of the wounded and dying the wounded were gathered quickly and moved back towards a small camp established by the phoenix syndar some of the worst wounds were treated but the healers resources were quickly depleted some of the infected were treated as well but the rest of the spell casters with divine magic ran out of energy quickly with no way to heal or purify some of the infected a vandregon soldier and an order cleric were put to death and burned on the spot by the survivors the camp was quickly picked up and the survivors moved northeast towards watchwolf territory the menace of the lich on mardrun has been ended for goodoctober 2728th 2012  onsallas outpost event with the recent betrayal of clan whiteoak pack longfang is apprehensive about visitors and has increased the number of warriors in the village this has reduced the longfang presence in the outpost itself to a small skeleton crew the outpost was a host to a number of factions such as the watchwolves the new vandregon and the order of arnaths fist these groups had come together to discuss the undead reaching mardrun and to search for ways to find and destroy the lich the lich was rumored to be hiding in the dirge swamp somewhere and the watchful eyes of both the longfang hunters and the orders eagles were scouting the area a group of vandregon soldiers searching the woods found one of their members a cleric who had been missing since his convoy was attacked by the lich a couple weeks ago with him was a wounded infected and delirious man who claimed to be a vandregon ranger once healed and given time to rest it was discovered that he was a survivor from the boat that landed earlier in the year he confirmed that the boat had been attacked by humans and that he had been on the run from the mordok in the woods and the swamp ever since the news he brought of faedrun was not good stating that he was part of the southern army during the fall and had been on the run doing guerrilla attacks on penitent and undead forces for the last several years contact had been lost with the northern army and the pockets of resistance in southern vandregon and aldoria were being surrounded and massacred the ranger had companions with him that carried a blade and a magical item known as a key later that evening the undead attacked in an organized group and almost overran the outpost resources were exhausted in repelling them and healing the wounds and bites but the outpost held the size and organization of the zombie horde was proof that the lich was nearby a battle cleric of the order of arnaths fist researched the item and discovered that the key could be used to power magical items the ranger described the blade and the adventurers went out to search for it when the group found the location where the other ranger had fallen and was killed by the undead the blade was missing roving bandits had picked the corpse clean and hid in the swamp the adventurers had to split up and track down the bandits in order to retrieve the blade when the orders cleric returned to examine the blade it was discovered that a traveling healer and her companions had stolen and hidden the blade from the adventurers and demanded money to turn it over what almost escalated into a bloody encounter was talked down by raskolf representative of the watchwolves who paid for the blade and promised the healer could leave safely with the blade finally in the hands of the order it was discovered to be a maykar paladin blade with the paladin most likely long since dead the blades magical qualities were dormant scrolls and ancient texts detailed that the key could possibly power the blade but it could come at a terrible price the willing sacrifice of the life of the wielder would be required to channel the magic of the blade into a weapon that could defeat the lich more research was needed to understand the ritual and would take time and resources from the order a message reached the outpost that a gravestone had been sighted in the dirge swamp in an area crawling with undead with the gravestone discovered a squad of battle brothers of the order were going to attack the lich to draw it away from the stone and buy the adventurers and vandregon soldiers time to destroy it with the lich away from the stone the adventures attacked it to perform a ritual and destroy the undead the battle was long and brutal resulting in several of the adventurers being killed and several more bleeding out in the swamp the order cleric accompanying the adventurers sacrificed himself to keep the undead at bay long enough to drag out the wounded with the adventurers bloodied and in need of healing they returned to the outpost with the gravestone destroyed the lich was confirmed to be on the move again and messenger hawks were sent to all the factions of its destination photos from the eventthe caravan of supplies heading to the reach was ambushed by roving bands of mordok but the supplies made it with an influx of supplies the provisioner and his staff kept the merchants trade moving with a handful of vandregon soldiers a few ulven and some adventurers the reachs gates were kept safe from the bands of mordok around the campfire the group tended to their bruises and tried to mend their armor but without a real blacksmith the armor and equipment started to fail there was suspicious activity going on when the provisioner snuck off in the night and met with a business associate but supplies were searched for and found a large harvest of white blossoms and fae leaves were discovered in the woods the provisioner used the distraction of a mordok attack to convince some of the guards to leave the gates and then stole all of the supplies in the reach money potions mending strips bandages healing supplies food all of the gathered reagents from the woods were stolen as he fled out the back gates a small group went after him especially after the gathered adventurers learned that the provisioner was in charge of the supplies and had been acting funny and was suspected to be working for another noble trying to exhaust baroness katherines resources since the reach is primarily funded by heronsallas outpost was to be the sight of a series of political meetings and discussions between several ulven factions some representatives from vandregon and different adventuring parties were also present the escalation of the ulven civil war was on everyones minds and faction leaders wanted to know where everyone stood during the conflict onsallas village was host to a large group of ulven from clan whiteoak who had pledged allegiance to clan nightriver some bandits were seen roaming the wilderness but increased patrols on the road kept transportation between the village and the outpost safe the mordok had been acting suspiciously lately and there seemed to be increased activity in the swamp nearby upon further investigation there was a sight of intense evil a ritual site that was corrupting the swamp and eating away at all the life around it at the center of the site was a mordok idol a skull painted with tribal designs a group was dispatched to find it and learn more about it aeden von horst battle cleric of the order touched the idol and it dispersed its magic and stopped corrupting the swamp several other adventurers researched it and aeden discovering that some of the magic was transferred to him but no other information was learned about what happened or its purpose later in the evening a message was intercepted that proved that clan whiteoak planned on betraying the longfangs and would help clan grimward attack them with only a small window before the attack the adventurers had to choose how they would split their defenses without enough fighters sent to the village it could easily be overrun a small group of warriors left the outpost and fought their way to reach the village cut off from support or allies this group would succeed or die trying the remaining defenders coordinated their defense as a large group of clan grimward warriors attacked the outpost for what seemed like ages the heavily armored warriors grimward assaulted the outpost many adventurers and guards were wounded equipment busted and shields were broken but after a long fight the attackers were repelled the next day the location of a caravan was discovered it had been lost traveling to onsallas when a search party arrived the caravan members rose from the ground as zombies and attacked zombies in this area were proof that the lich had at least traveled through this area several people were bitten and the group retreated to the outpost after gathering more members and some supplies they returned to clear out the zombies and retrieve the cargo with the box secure the group retreated before being dragged down and torn apart by the undead another group was ambushed on the trails and several members were abducted by the mordok after hours had passed another search party went out to find the mordok camp ylsa stormherald of the watchwolves was found running through the swamp bloodied and beaten by the mordok she was rescued and the mordok following her killed or driven off the events detailing her time being captured are still a mystery photos from the event the wayward inn has been seeing a steady business since the trade routes to several settlements have been made safer following the grimward summit news of the bloodbath spread quickly panic has gripped each settlement as they are not sure what to expect next in a land where all the colonists are guests a civil war amongst the native ulven has everyone on edge the patrons of the inn weathered a rainy storm inside by telling stories of past deeds discussing what might happen next after war was declared and enjoying the food and drink of the inn several adventurers sparred outside some members of different ulven packs confronted each other and had a honor duel and patrons walked the trails and enjoyed the land around the inn everything seemed to be a fairly quiet day until a wounded ulven stumbled into inn with a warning of violence it was shortly after that when hunting parties of pack graytide showed up in the area and tried to raid the inn there was a brutal fight and many adventurers were wounded or even within inches of death the first hunting party of graytides were killed or repelled the number of wounded was staggering and it was obvious that the hunting parties had signaled for more reinforcements as the adventurers finalized a plan to escape and head towards a nearby settlement a second hunting party raided the inn and burst through the back door they killed the tavern staff and stormed upstairs and killed some of the patrons who had been staying in their rooms the tavern owner escaped with the group of adventurers who tried to stall the ulven warriors and barricade the door to buy them time the graytides broke through the door and gave chase as the screams of the dying patrons were drowned out by the roar of the fire consuming the inn with graytides close on their heels the adventurers and surviving inn staff moved as quickly as they could along the trail southeast the wounded were carried or hobbled along as fast as they could several adventurers hung back to stall the advancing graytides but the group got separated and some were taken down by graytides luckily the wounded were recovered and everyone made it to the next settlement which was firmly inside clan nightriver territory not wanting to invade clan nightriver territory the graytide warriors stopped giving chase and members of each side shouted oaths of vengeance and threats to each other the pack graytide warriors eventually fell back leaving the mass of wounded adventurers seeking shelter and healing aid at the new settlementold wounds epilogue horus von horst sat down he had never felt this old before though the night had been considered a victory he knew the end was not even close jack his oldest companion was dead rory sturm the explorer who had the best idea where to find the artifact was also dead to make matters worse the agent of rorys death seemed to be an altogether different opponent it had been a day of set backs it could easily have been disastrous if not for the unhesitating assistance of the brave group at the fort the more he thought about it the more he came to realize that so little was known about the the lich and the dangers faced he knew he had not destroyed the idol it was more likely that the lich and his army had left the area and whatever link was shared with the idol was severed he thought it would hearten the adventures if they thought it was destroyed some of the ulven had wanted to pitch it into the swamp there was a time when horus had once thought this way too but much to his dismay he knew that what is once lost can be found again horus and his allies had spent the last several years chasing this monster with little success each encounter had left him with fewer allies and friends it seemed as if mere men could not resist this threat but horus had endured and survived he wondered why he himself was not dead yet by all rights he should have died on faedrun but there was no time for this kind of thinking he would mourn the dead later there was too much at stake the undead could not be allowed to take root on mardrun perhaps out of this new group of adventurers there would be more willing to join the fight on top of that he now had an idea provided by rorys map of where the artifact was an expedition must be mounted into the dirge swamp finding the soul eater would let him end the lich for good and perhaps help to wash some of the blood of his hands before any of this could happen he had to pay a visit to his old friend karl and leave the idol in good hands knocking the dust off his boots he stood up there was much work to do  far down the road a group of suspicious men feasted as if there were no tomorrow and some said the weeping of a rather large merchant could be heard on the wind blowing through the empty pockets of adventurers  a mordok idol reduced to ashes by the ever cautious and vigilant ulven scattered in the wind  mysterious runes gave up their secrets to those who had the patience  the hermit had not seen such excitement in a long time the bump on her head soon went away more bells would be needed for she and her snake to be safe perhaps another door too  mordok fought mordok though few saw it and even fewer asked why  no adventurer had claimed the mining guilds hidden coffers and fittingly the treasures pulled from the earth by man would be returned there by nature soon enough  in a dark and forgotten corner of the once again abandoned fort a misplaced crate of fruit biscuits cheese and sausages slowly began rotting photos from the eventthe nobility of the colony welcomed all of the adventurers and factions with open arms bringing them into the heart of the colony and to the dinner they had hosted there were representatives from numerous factions the different nobles of the city and from adventuring groups after some introductions drinks and socializing the guests were further entertained with food and dancers shortly after tensions mounted as khulgar graytide chieftan of pack graytide and representative of clan grimward started a scene and called everyones attention he was angry and cynical making snide comments about how sorry he was for rudely interrupting some important affairs like wining and dining he delivered the note from the watchwolves clan which stated that the colonists need to be kept in check in order for peace to exist khulgar then called branthur nightriver into question about his soft ways in dealing with the colonists and that the ulven need to put them in their place many dinner participants mocked or challenged khulgar and branthur reminded him of his place and that the colony is on clan nightriver territory nobody at the dinner tried to calm khulgar or discover clan grimwards terms which resulted him the chieftan storming off angrily with threats against and from him being the last communication the graytide had for the evening shortly after a member of the colony watch arrived with two letters one was a message from prince aylin of new aldoria the message was read aloud to the group where prince aylin apologized for not being in attendance offered up help and assistance and showed genuine care for the safety of the colonists most of the people gathered did not believe the honesty to be genuine but that meetings with prince aylin and his nobles should be setup in the near future the second letter was a watch report from the sergeant who had been notified that a patrol found a boat on the coastline it had been abandoned but there was blood and signs of a fight some personal items found on the boat suggested that a ranger from vandregon survived the trip over from faedrun but was nowhere to be found one of nobles said they would investigate it further and so did some of the adventurers by the end of the evening several factions had worked closely with branthur nightriver to expand relations with the colony of the assembled nobles there was definitely a subtle power struggle as baroness katherin and baron richard vied for support and expansion of relations baron richard ended up making numerous deals with the different factions and gained more political support than baroness katherin several other nobles have since pledged support to baron richard making him the strongest and wealthiest of the colonys leaders photos from the eventscenario 1 a handful of elite vandregon soldiers went out on a dangerous mission to move through penitent lines and get to a village near the coast the village contained a boat that was almost complete and was seaworthy if repaired after punching through the penitent lines with speed the vandregon infantry setup a defense in the village a vandregonian ranger and a ships crew began to work on fixing the boat enough so that it would sail but they needed time small groups of penitent threw themselves at the defenders in an attempt to overrun them the ranks of penitent were joined by undead eventually as reports of the soldiers made its way to other penitent groups the vandregon soldiers held them back and stayed alive long enough for the ranger and the ship crew to fix the small boat but there was not enough room or supplies to carry everyone in a valiant charge the vandregon infantry counter attacked the penitent lines and pushed them away from the coast they took the fight to the enemy and were slain one by one as the numbers and wounds overwhelmed them they gave their lives to buy the ranger time to get out to sea without being pursued scenario 2 the woods near the wayward inn were dangerous as reports filtered in about a large group of mordok roaming the area new aldoria sent an armed escort for their emissary who was to deliver a letter to the political dinner in newhope but they were moving through these dangerous roads and pack graytide warriors were scouting the area bloody skirmishes broke out along the roads as the mordok attacked the guards escorting the emissary were able to protect him long enough to get him to the border of the colony to deliver the message they were attacked upon their return and several guards were killed but the message was delivered from prince aylin of new aldoria pack graytide warriors took the brunt of the attack on the roads and met the mordok head on through a serious of intense and bloody fights pack graytide killed numerous mordok but lost over 10 warriors in the fight the mordok were cleared out of the area but graytide warriors limped their wounded to the newhope colony in order to seek healing and supplies with the roads open khulgar graytide was able to make it to the colony to represent clan grimward and to deliver the message from the watchwolves clan photos from the eventbusiness has picked up at the wayward inn as the place is cleaned up and repaired the wayward now has a fulltime innkeeper and staff and travelers merchants and adventurers come and go several groups of patrons enjoyed feasts drinks gambling games tales or heroic andor dastardly deeds and overall tavern life a few members of the group sat down and discussed some of the items that had been discovered over the last couple months but a lot of questions remain without answers however the roads outside are still dangerous there are no patrols of guards or adventurers that protect the roadways and bandits have been making a living preying off of travelers there were several attacks on the road by bandits and several adventurers were wounded and beaten up but no lives were lost hired swords to fill guard duty jobs were in demand as resources and reagents were searched for and recovered in the woods the mordok continue to prowl the area in small but lethal numbers a small group of adventurers went out to escort a healer to the local farm the farmer and his family provide food to the wayward but upon arriving at the farm it was discovered that the entire family was slaughtered at first bandits were suspected but that idea was dismissed after the mordok soon appeared a few fierce battles broke out in the woods near the inn and several adventurers were severely wounded and there was even a raid on the inn itself but the mordok were repelled or beaten back most of the adventurers were too well equipped or numerous for the mordok to fight so the battles quickly dissolved into small skirmishes or mordok prowling just outside of arrow range as night settled in on the wayward there was a messenger that came to the wayward and delivered an invitation to a number of the adventurers of all factions and backgrounds there is to be a political dinner in newhope hosted by a number of nobles and barons and numerous faction leaders the nobility has extended this invitation to the adventurers that have been at the center of a lot of commotion lately photos from the eventdecember 18th  blood  ice summary several groups of adventurers have made their way to the wayward inn a previously abandoned roadside tavern some of the nobility of newhope have dedicated resources into fixing up the establishment and getting it running again it was previously abandoned due to it being too close to mordok territory but with the help of the ulven presence and the expansion of the human settlements it can be reopened about the same time the adventurers arrived there were increased reports of bandits in the woods and also a group of aldorian guards were spotted in the area an aldorian scout came to the wayward inn and offered a reward for the death of the bandits and the return of a nobles daughter that was kidnapped several adventurers went out to confront the bandits but were persuaded not to kill them after they explained that they were political refugees the nobles daughter explained that she had not been kidnapped at all but had run off to elope with one of the rebels the adventurers then came back to the wayward inn to discuss a plan the scout offered even more money for their help and although it was assumed the aldorian was not telling them the whole truth she was not pressed for more info soon after that the rest of the aldorian guard in the area showed up and said that the rebel camp was abandoned if they were not able to bring the rebels to justice they were ordered to bring in or kill the families of those helping the rebels and left to carry out that mission the adventurers were not willing to sit idly by with soldiers going to the homes of innocent people and went to intervene after a confrontation and some harsh words from both sides a fight broke out and several adventurers and guards were severely wounded the aldorian captain promised revenge on them and anyone who associated themselves with that group the followers of crows landing were specifically pointed out as being involved in attacking the guards soon after that a daughter of gaia from pack fieldcrow showed up under pack longfang guard and gathered a small group to investigate a series of taints and diseases in the forest upon arriving at a tree tainted by mordok magic the daughter of gaia began a cleansing ritual and sprang a magical trap that clamped onto her arm once the trap went off there were a number of mordok lying in ambush and led by an alpha that attacked the group her guards could not release her and held their ground but were in danger of being overrun and destroyed the fight stalled for a moment when one of the adventurers challenged the mordok alpha and the other mordok gave them room to fight the duel between the ulven warrior and the mordok alpha continued until a second group of adventurers arrived and gave assistance since the mordok trap was magical and they could not remove it quickly the adventurers severed the arm of the daughter of gaia to get her away and back to the inn once that was done and the other adventurers pressed back on the mordok the alpha retreated into the woods prematurely ending the duel two adventuring parties were formed to scout out and find some mordok camps in the area the groups would have to split up completely in order to check both camps the first group ended up running into the nearby camp to the south that the alpha retreated to and fell back and called for help from the second group the second group returned and helped the first and organized their efforts on the mordok camp and eventually took the alpha down during their retreat out of the camp a human rogue slipped in and recovered some sort of skin or leather piece that had cryptic runes and symbols on it because of the focused effort on the first camp the second mordok camp was not scouted out or discovered once the adventurers were back to the wayward inn several groups went out to hunt down roaming mordok in the woods a few fights broke out and some adventurers were beaten up pretty badly but the mordok were driven off all the adventurers returned to the wayward inn and either parted ways or stayed for the night as darkness set in photos from the event dear priestess ravensmark today i learned a lot about human nature humans are a lot more complicated than ulven they are better at lying i have found that in order to get the truth from a human one must expect to ask the same question at least three times they are very manipulative i have tried to keep an open mind and have done my best to integrate myself into their society but it is an uncomfortable space one thing that confuses me is their lack of unity whilst the ulven nation has never been well organized we have always had a certain kinship among the clans even the clanless packs such as our friends the longfangs have always proven reliable in time of need the humans on the other hand have a very complex system of kingdoms and fiefdoms there is no unified human nation rather than work together the different groups seem to consider themselves to be rivals and even enemies the humans classify each other based on wealth breeding and political standing it is no wonder that they were unable to defend their homes from the undead doubtless the different kingdoms stood by and watched their neighbors get eaten by the hungry ghosts when they should have banded together under one banner the most treacherous and manipulative humans i have met thus far seem to be the aldorians they wear the colors of blue and green these arrogant and cowardly people call themselves soldiers and boast of their martial prowess yet hire mercenaries to fight for them they are quick to turn on unarmed civilians though or to feign friendship in order to lure others into an ambush their warleader was a bully and a thug he refused to talk to me stating that my fangs made me of a lesser station than he this certainly didnt stop him from trying to hire me as a mercenary though and trying to trick me into doing violence on his behalf against a pitiful group of starving freezing refugees whom he mislabeled as bandits whilst traveling in their company the aldorians attacked us on the trail the attack was sudden and without provocation elise fierce little warrior that she is slew one of our attackers and gravely injured another before i sent her running for help we managed to fight off the aldorians whose martial prowess is nowhere near what they boast but suffered many wounded among our own the aldorians fled into the woods to lick their wounds and their warleader made many empty threats as they ran away it is here that i wish to apologize my priestess for though i tried to stay out of this i was directly involved in the fighting violating the cause of my diplomatic mission i place myself at your mercy priestess but i was defending myself fellow ulven and certain humans who have proven themselves worthy allies throughout the course of my travels i am confident that the reports from the eyes and the ears will confirm my account there are some humans who seem to have risen above this however independent and stouthearted adventurers have severed ties from their kingdoms these hardy individuals have joined the local ulven in the war against the mordok some of them seem to be brave and trustworthy allies but there are also roving bands of brigands and thieves who prey upon travelers even other humans just as soon as they would draw steel upon the mordok i think that the biggest failing of the humans is their lack of unity though they appear to be very organized it is a ruse these humans are actually a fractured people the ulven have stood together as brothers and sisters against a common foe for as long as we can remember our greatest strength lies not in our individual warriors but in the pack our people live and die for their packs and in the service of gaia and the great wolf these humans tend to be selfish by comparison and are further splintered because they have too many gods when they were faced with a common foe their fragile political alliances and bureaucracy betrayed them i managed to make contact with the human pack known as the bastards again these adventurers were friendly and welcoming and broke bread with us they were much more accepting of us than the treacherous and racist cowards of aldoria unlike other humans who consider strictly monogamous relationships between their ancestors to be paramount to honor and good breeding these bastards stay out of their parents sex lives i decided to seek out and observe these particular humans because they seem to thrive under conditions where other humans flounder it seems that the secret to their success is that they have adopted an organization similar to our own they are essentially a pack but one made up primarily of humans they have in their company an ulven warrior and though he does not appear to be the leader im sure that he has been instrumental to their survival these humans are hardy and adaptable unfortunately they still seem to fall victim to certain human failings their leader is friendly and eccentric but though he showed us generosity at theinn he is greedy when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge and arcane artifacts he was only motivated to pursue the mordok after harlok longfang relayed that the mordok had in their possession a magic weapon the bastards proved to be good fighters but as soon as we downed the mordok alpha the bastards grabbed the cursed blade and withdrew as a small number of us fought a desperate retreat more importantly i learned that the bastards have stolen a dangerous idol from the mordok at davens reach it was described as a small female figurine with tentacles the bastard who possesses it has been reportedly acting strangely and complaining of nightmares the mordok have been relentless in their pursuit of this item a couple of bastards seem to share my belief that this item needs to be destroyed but they are unsure of how to safely dispose of the item an elderly wiseman who stopped at theinn stated that such an item may not be mordok in origin he said that there was a possibility that this idol may have come from the old world with the settlers naturally my chief concern is that the improper disposal of such an artifact could release a plague upon our world similar to that which destroyed the world of the humans in this matter i humbly request your guidance as i fear that this idol could possibly be one of the dark portents you sensed upon the west wind your faithful warder the voice of the watchwolves raskolf vakrnovember 5th  6th  of watchers and wolves with the fort of davens reach up and running again trade caravans began to flow back and forth on schedule to newhope a group of adventurers followed the trail of the mordok shaman to the onsallas outpost the most remote ulven settlement and fortification before mordok territory upon arriving the adventurers were met with a cold demeanor as the pack longfang guards assigned to the outpost were hesitant to trust the newcomers just the night before the outpost was attacked and one ulven warrior was killed and another was dragged off by the mordok the adventurers set up a tavern in the outpost and began to interact with the guards and try to gain their favor scouts reported seeing a red haired woman nearby and upon further investigation discovered it to be arya earthwalker a crazy syndar who lived in the swamp although alone and apparently unarmed the mordok did not kill her and appeared to leave her alone after being sent off to find random objects for her and trying to understand her crazy banter she then cast a spell on aden haleth von horst apparently some sort of protection spell a small group of adventurers left in search of the mordok camp in order to retrieve the captured ulven warrior along the way they discovered old and abandoned watch towers in the swamp that belonged to pack blackwing inside one of them they found an old ulven corpse and a journal explaining more information on pack blackwings attempt to tame the swamp the group was ambushed by mordok hunters along the way but they discovered the mordok camp in it was the chewed on and dismembered remains of the captured ulven warrior which were scooped up and taken back to the outpost the mordok hunters constantly used poison on anyone they attacked but the outpost was well stocked with pineed sap that was used to counter and cure them the nearby pineed trees were being harvested of their sap regularly but the mordok slipped past the defenses and performed a ritual inside the trees although they were killed or driven back the mordok had wilted a tree and tainted its sap rill the daughter of gaia assigned to the outpost gathered other clerics and spiritual casters from all three races and performed a cleansing ritual on the tree the taint was destroyed and the corruption was removed but it is clear that the mordok know of the ulvens use of the sap to cure poisons and now has a way of corrupting it the pack longfang priestess in the nearby village has sent scouts with word of this to nearby clans to warn them of this new threat tension between the ulven and the colonists were further stretched when a group of humans intended to take over the outpost they knocked a number of warriors unconscious and it appeared they had no intention of killing the outpost guards but when another party of ulven and humans arrived they fought back and retook the outpost most of the humans were killed but a few had escaped it is not sure what their agenda is just how many colonists are involved or if there is a faction responsible for the attack a pack of graytide warriors travelled through the area and stirred up some trouble with some of the humans in the outpost tensions were on the rise as their opposing view of the colonists began to escalate into debates and confrontations this reached a breaking point when khulgar graytide confronted freya rev anda to an honor duel for an event that happened in the past with pack graytide and pack fenrir the unarmed and nonlethal duel took a deadly turn when khulgar graytide intended to kill freya but she beat him back and won the duel as the graytide warriors were driven out of the camp they shouted angry words and insults to the longfang warriors at the outpost it is not yet known what impact this will have on relations between graytide the other ulven and the colonists after things quieted down there was an assassination attempt inside the outpost a man posing as an envoy for a noble in newhope got into the outpost and attempted to kill one of the adventurers with a poisoned dagger the guards attempted to stop him but he was able to get away during his escape the outpost guards and adventurers noticed that he too was a syndar later in the evening a large raiding party of mordok led by the shaman came out of the dirge swamp when the outpost prepared to repel the attack the raiding party changed course and moved towards the village the outpost guards and their adventurer allies charged to meet the attacking mordok in hopes of stopping them before they reached the village defenses a large battle took place as the mordok got closer to the village between attrition and the power of the shamans push spells the mordok were on the verge of breaking away to assault the village when aden haleth von horst charged in to deal with the shaman the true power of the magic cast by the red haired syndar was revealed when all push spells were ineffective against him led by aden the adventurers charged the lines and slaughtered the remaining mordok and killed the shaman as the adventurers and guards return to the outpost to fix their equipment and rest there are still a number of questions that have gone unanswered even though the shaman was finally defeated scouts in the area have reported increased movement of mordok and the possible sighting of an alpha mordok in the dirge swamp photos from the eventseptember 24th  the aftermath of davens reach with the fort of davens reach up and running again the tradesmen of the fort expanded their businesses and more caravans arrived with supplies the mordok in the area gathered in number and attacked several groups of adventurers and a large battle took place in the outskirts of the mines they were led by a shaman who seemed to be searching for something in the area he was forced to flee in the first fight but dropped a satchel with random items in it including more clues several people were poisoned and mortally wounded and a stronger defense was established in town one of the local authorities posted up a wanted poster that offered a bounty for the capture of a man some of the adventurers looked for him and he was eventually discovered and captured but someone inside of the fort released him he has not been seen since and has presumed to have left the area the bounty is still being offered in exchange for this fugitive after the mordok tested the defenses of the fort and were repelled they retreated to their camp a large group of well armed and armored adventurers set out to find the mordok camp and search for clues when they arrived they stumbled across a camp much larger than anticipated and a large battle took place although many mordok were killed several adventurers fell in battle and were even feasted upon they just barely escaped and some almost did not survive the journey back into town with fresh blood on their lips the mordok counter attacked and threw waves upon waves of mordok at the fort gates the stalwart defense of the fort guards and adventurers kept them at bay but many people were injured and a lot of equipment was damaged in the fight the defenders used the idol they found to taunt the mordok shaman who appeared to be enraged that it had been stolen at first the mordok attacked in suicidal waves which then changed to coordinated attacks on the gate with their wounded leaving before they could be finished off eventually the mordok retreated entirely scouts have reported that the group of mordok and the shaman have been seen heading towards the dirge swamp photos from the eventjuly 24th  last hope premier after scheduled trade caravans were delayed and eventually never arrived to the colony of new hope a party of adventurers were gathered and sent out to investigate the fort of davens reach upon their arrival a group of mercenaries impeded their progress and told them they were not to enter the fort a small skirmish broke out and the mercenaries retreated out of the area when the adventurers went into the fort they had discovered that the place was completely vacant supplies had been ransacked and there seemed to be nothing of value left upon further inspection they found mutilated body parts and blood around the fort and traces of evidence as to what had happened they found a clues that something wasnt quite right after the fort was cleaned up the next trade caravan arrived and the fort was back up and running some tradesmen in town began to set up shops and hire adventurers to find supplies in the nearby woods at this time the mordok began to hunt in the area and several fights broke out between the adventurers and the mordok a group set out to track down the mordok in the area and investigated a nearby shanty town apparently abandoned by the miners who used to work the nearby mine head they came across a mordok shrine in a building that held a clay idol which was taken by the group back to the fort the mordok ambushed the group and a skirmish took place in the shanty town the mordok pursued the adventurers back into the fort and attacked the gates attempting to find a way in the defenders of the fort kept them at bay just barely and the mordok wave was repelled photos from the eventstory info the current year is 212 of the commonalty calendar war has ravaged the continent of faedrun for 13 years reports have circulated that the syndar kingdoms devastated by war and taking the brunt of the initial undead forces have slowly retreated north further into their territories for the last few years some kingdoms have abandoned their lands and consolidated forces as the undead plague and penitent followers continue to push into the heart of faedrun  the grand alliance is made up of a number of human and syndar kingdoms and has stood together for the last 7 years with its strengths come weaknesses as the different military forces and their leaders continue to try to work together as a cohesive force the first few years had been costly but by now enough time has passed that the grand alliance has been working together quite well but the war on faedrun is beyond the scope of anything anybody had ever imagined one of the military forces deployed to the grand alliance is the mushalee boluk a company of soldiers under the command of the current ranking commander the bolukbashi this specialized military unit is made up of soldiers and support personnel that are sent to deal with undead forces that have been able to cross the searing heat of the desert of the maykar dominion scouts have reported to the bolukbashi allied syndar forces have become aware of some sort of anomaly that appears to have been discovered in one of the oasis on the edges of the maykar dominion it has some of the higher ranking syndar officers concerned and the mushalee boluk military unit has been ordered to scout out the oasis reports also confirm the presence of incoming penitent forces so it appears to be a race against time to discover anything that they can   event summary   as the mushalee boluk of the maykar dominion marched with other grand alliance forces the penitent forces in the area moved in with equal vigor and tenacity for hours the two forces crashed into each other fighting over supplies and critical locations of territory as well as trying to avoid the ire of the undead that seemed to crawl out from the swamp lands around after a brief pause in the fighting the source of the anomaly in the area was a crypt with a village built over the top of it a strange magic emanated from the crypts depths and both sides wanted to either control it or cleanse it wave after wave of grand alliance and penitent forces clashed in pitched battle which saw immense casualties for both sides of the conflict the penitents initial success of controlling territory and gaining supplies during the day was countered by the success of the armed forces of the mushalee boluk and its allies during this final push at the crypt at the end of the day it seemed that both sides had come to a tie the penitents willingness to die for their cause had helped them come out on top when fighting for control of the surrounding areas but it could not out weigh the mushalee boluk and the grand alliances defensive tactics and training which helped them to withstand the tides of penitent and undead that were crashing against them in the village atop the crypt both sides being on equal footing moved from the area in order to consolidate what they had gained and lost from this endeavor what either side will do to that end remains to be seen   photos click here to see photos from the eventafter setting up a full garrison in a nearby keep the 5th regiment of vandregons northern army began establishing a more permanent supply line to support the war the nearby village was recently overrun by penitent and the underground mines ceased operation a message was received from a nearby village about a unit of vandregon soldiers who discovered something of high importance upon arriving the 5th had to retake the village after they discovered that the penitent had captured it and killed the vandregon unit stationed there a mysterious necklace was found which began to influence some of the soldiers in strange ways with good steel critical to the war effort a small team of vandregon soldiers went into the mines to investigate only a few survived an encounter with the undead and the mines remained closed scouts reported that some of the undead leaders had followed them to the keep and with the help of several maykar clerics and lions of arnaths fist were able to hold back the undead and force a retreat on the penitent soon it was discovered that the necklace that was found was a powerful item containing dark magic the maykar clerics decided to destroy it using a ritual of magic attempting the ritual would draw the undead in the area to the garrison the army of the 5th held their line and kept the undead back while the maykar completed their work many brave soldiers died in the fight against the powerful undead but the 5th regiment was able to drive them back now with the war dragging

small and barely out of its infancy so far they have had some dealings with new aldoria and the pheonix syndar but they are always looking for opportunities to expand their trade to further reaches of mardrun the faction was established by a group of friends and traveling companions who having survived the destruction on faedrun now seek to establish themselves in the new world the consortium is not merely interested in the acquiring of wealth but in the improvement of mardrun as a whole they seek to make it safer and easier to get affordable quality goods and services to as many people on the continent as possible their motto exaes erigit omnes naves or a rising tide raises all ships speaks to this intent they do not have any specific allegiance to any nation or race and welcome anyone to their ranks who is willing to pull their weight their emblem is four crossed keys which marks their goods caravans and any personnel employed by them the more complex version has the emblem in red on a background parted per cross in black and white current members kreiger bloodfang bryech savagefang orrin kair echo nightriverthe lost aldorians established roughly a century ago oarsmeet was once a small fishing village barely within the borders of the kingdom of aldoria as the years passed the village grew and with it its reputation thieves thugs and pirates were slowly drawn to the port town some for the promise of an easy fortune taken from the unwary or unwitting others for the call of danger still more came for a fresh start as the law enforcement in aldoria seldom bothered with such a remote little village leaving criminals with a chance to lay low for months on end around the time of the undead attacks aldoria saw the threat posed by a town of pirates as they prepared to sail across the sea to the new continent and eventually dispatched a crew of sailors and soldiers to dispose of the vagabonds as quickly as possible to avoid any future confrontations the crew led by commander jackston ridgebon and his second lieutenant anne cash set sail immediately for oarsmeet by the time they arrived however the attacks were growing more and more persistent with the people of oarsmeet struggling just to weather the waves of attacks commander ridgebon with his orders strengthening his resolve was content to leave the scene and simply wait for the pirates to be overrun by the undead he ordered his crew back onto the ship to return to aldoria a handful of sailors lieutenant cash included refused to leave they felt that it was their duty to the people of aldoria even if they were criminals to ensure their safety however possible commander ridgebon gave them a lifeboat and sent them ashore deeming them deserters and criminals just like the lot they were going to try to help between the ingenuity of the criminals and the discipline of the sailors oarsmeet soon had a simple guard set up resilient enough to hold off the undead and penitent long enough to evacuate the town by commissioning the aid of a local pirate by the name of mad morty blackwaters and his ship the blue ruby as well as a few other vessels cash and her fellow deserters were able to secure passage to the new continent after weeks of increasing aggressions by the undead the citizens of oarsmeet were finally ready and able to leave their homes once and some feared for all as the women children and elderly began to board the vessel one of the towns scouts burst into the barracks once a minor gambling hall that had been repurposed out of necessity a bite wound in his right arm the blood drained from his face as he collapsed uttering two final words with his last breath theyre close as the guard scrambled to form some sort of defense against the imminent attack a small horde of penitent erupted from the woods near the village charging the town eager to spill blood that night they set fire to houses and swarmed around anyone they could find like a hive of bees insistent on stinging a target to death before moving to the next sensing that defeat would soon be upon them cash ordered the retreat back to the ships and to shove off once they were full sailors covered the retreat as pirates helped with wounded onto the ships each ship setting sail when they could no longer afford to take on another passenger finally all that remained were the sailors who had so far survived the attack who began to board the final ship in the dock the blue ruby herself with no force rallied against them the penitent rushed to the shoreline and unleashed volley after volley of flaming arrows towards the ships sails were ignited leaving the ships and their passengers sitting like ducks in the water some had holes burned in their hulls dragging the passengers down to a watery grave in all of the seven ships gathered to transport the citizens of oarsmeet only two the blue ruby and the interceptor a small vessel carrying many of the wounded soldiers survived the onslaught still they sailed always looking back to shed a tear and share a song for those who died that day to the new world during their voyage the two ships were blown slightly off course landing not on the shores of new aldoria but rather on a seemingly uninhabited beach they would soon learn however that this was not the case at all shortly after reaching the shore a forward scout reported seeing movement in the forest they looked like men he began short of breath from both fear and exertion but they moved like wolves animalistic as a pack right this way as the scout had warned soon enough the pack of eight was upon the settlers encircling them as a pack of wolves would do a large male clad in bear fur approached mad morty you are in grimward territory outsiders give me one good reason not to cut you down where you stand the answer the settlers gave made no difference these ulven were hostile and saw the aldorians as invaders weapons were drawn threats were made and taunts exchanged two aldorians fell to ulven blades while an ulven took an arrow to the heart collapsing with a mighty thud the ulven retreated their skill great though it may be was insufficient to overcome the dozens of settlers they faced a promise was made though for the ulven to return that the aldorians may never know peace from their wrath an ulven promise made is a promise kept and the next day another small pack came to the encampment to harass the settlers throwing rocks and insults seemingly reluctant to strike the first blow the aldorians had banded together and soon set about constructing proper if slightly crude buildings stone walls and wooden fences roofs to shelter them from the elements and a roaring bonfire to drown out the howls of their ulven tormentors no ulven came that night nor the next for a week the aldorians slept in a wary peace ever watchful of their new distrustful neighbors on the second night a scout failed to return lost as most had suspected but none knew how right they were on the third night the scout was found scattered throughout the forest torn apart large chunks of flesh missing from his limbs and torso a look of pure fear unlike any seen since the first undead attacks frozen on his lifeless face on the fourth night two more scouts disappeared only to be found in similar grisly states the next day a war party was formed two dozen ablebodied fighters and clerics strode into the first ulven camp they saw accused of committing these acts the ulven seethed with rage despite the hatred they felt for the intruders the ulven live fight and die with honor they would not stoop so low as to defile a corpse in such a manner this is the work of the mordok ulven fists clenched and jaws tightened at the mere mention of their mortal enemies while a look of fear came over the aldorians what the hell is a mordok lieutenant cash now known as bloody anne first miss of the blue ruby asked more furious than scared the bearclad ulven from several days before let out a loud chortle rippling out to the surrounding few until the entire camp had joined in to mock the foolishness of the invaders good luck outsiders now he added reaching for his massive axe leading his companions to do the same run back to your little cottages before we show you the meaning of grimward hospitality so the hatred between the aldorians and the ulven festered like an open wound raiding parties would be sent to steal supplies burn buildings and slaughter livestock the other would deem a necessity skirmishes would break out on regular occasions although allout warfare had yet to erupt the aldorians would not actually see a mordok until a week later when the curious monster was attempting to free itself from a bear trap laid by an aldorian hunter it shrieked at the sight of the stranger more startled than frightened and in its panic tore the flesh from its leg as it bolted into the woods soon enough though the hunter felt eyes upon him he was also being hunted and took off for the camp as he made it into the clearing a mordok leapt towards him and grabbed his ankle knocking him to the ground the guards on patrol heard his cries for help and rushed to his location but all they found by the time they arrived was a bloody trail and several sets of footprints that seemed almost human a search party was assembled and they set off after the beasts following the trail of blood almost two hours later they found the hunter nearly unconscious with his back against a large boulder and a dagger in his hand three of the black skinned monsters were circling him while another lay dead and bleeding at his feet these were hunters themselves and knew that he would not live much longer one way or another so they waited the search party managed to slay one of the creatures and drove the other two off carrying the wounded hunter back to camp to patch him back up this marked the first time a lost aldorian had encountered a mordok and lived to see the light of day again new oarsmeet and the pirates of aldoria a number of years have passed and the small band of survivors has truly established themselves in the area as a town they designated new oarsmeet sturdy log walls encase the town and squat stone buildings crowd the land homes and businesses for the aldorians clan grimwards raids have only intensified cattle are no longer the object as they have found a greater use for captives the citizens of new oarsmeet while they do grow some of their own food and have taken to looting whatever they can from ulven outposts in the area have found their stores running dry faster than expected as a result the blue ruby will occasionally take to the sea once again in hopes of finding a merchant vessel or the like something heavy with coin or supplies the piracy is a blast from the past for some while others have a a slightly harder time justifying the theft of food from those who may also need it but starvation can be a powerful motivational tool and these individuals eventually agree that it is for the best new aldoria has reached out to new oarsmeet on more than one occasion sending a delegate to the town in hopes of convincing them to rejoin their former brethren feeling abandoned by the crown and the ideals it supposedly represents however these lost aldorians also known as the pirates of oarsmeet have rebuffed these offers time and time again until they feel aldoria has been returned to her former glory until she is once again a force to be reckoned with and a benevolent hand to be loved they will refuse to acknowledge the ruling class of new aldoria still wearing the green and blue of their homeland the lost aldorians have added the color purple to their uniforms often in the form of a scarf or flag worn on the belt to represent the royal family to whom many of them still feel they owe allegiance as well as the blood spilled in the water as they fled their home while they do not care for the nobles of new aldoria the pirates of oarsmeet try to maintain pleasant relations with the common folk of their homeland and will readily accept aid and commerce with other nations their opinion of the ulven has been tainted by clan grimward since you never get a second chance at first impression clan grimward continues to plague new oarsmeet with near constant raids although the aldorians have learned to better handle the situation and supplies they have received from trading with other nations have restored morale and saved many lives to this day they are distrustful of ulven culture even among friendly clans although they have resolved themselves to an uneasy peace with them known members bloody anne cashthe watchwolf diplomatic guard previously led by raskolf vakr was established as

peoples army and it used its strength to protect its people and its allies from all threats when the undead armies began to rise vandregon wasted no time mobilizing against this new threat brave men and women fought valiantly to protect their homes from the undead scourge as the war dragged on and city after city fell it seemed that not even the might of vandregon could hold back the enemy during the fall many vandregon soldiers gave their lives to give the citizens time to board the boats and escape though its army was decimated and its cities and capital lay in ruin the people of vandregon would live on in the continent of mardrun as the refugees of faedurn found their way to the colonies of mardrun they had little to no belongings or wealth and many were wounded or sick they found their new home was less than friendly and violent clashes between the native races of mardrun broke out some soldiers did survive the fall and the trek across the great sea and were involved in those conflicts after the treaty with the ulven and the colony of new hope was established many of those soldiers were recruited as guards to the nobles while others struck out on their own or settled down to make lives for them selves there were little resources and bodies left to rebuild the great vandregon army the old red and gray started to fade from memory there were a few that tried to bring back the glory of vandregon one such man was an old vandregon officer by the name of alexander aurgrim alexander saw a need for the peoples army again though the colonist of new hope found safety and settled into their homes and new life on mardrun those living outside the safety of those walls found life much harder desperate men turned to thievery and preyed on the weak on the unprotected roads threat of the savage mordok always loomed in the shadows alexander knew that if true prosperity was to come to his people security and protection had to be established the roads and vital trade routes had to be protected the smaller villages and farms had to be safe vandregon could be that shield    alexander toiled for years trying to acquire man power resources and allies anyone or anything that would lend to his cause a few did pledge support but none had the resources available to fund the construction of a large scale army many did not see a need for a grand peoples army the glory of vandregon was a memory and most citizens were concerned with their own day to day lives though his actions would sow the seeds of vandregons rebirth alexander would not live to see the vandregon colors rise again when alexander died his grandson william took up his cause william grew up hearing stories of vandregon from his grandfather he believed in the ideals of vandregon and shared in his grandfathers dream of a unified and protected nation william knew that if vandregon were to rise again people needed to remember what vandregon stud for so william took up his grandfathers colors and for two years lived the life of an adventurer william fought along side many brave warriors in that time he formed strong bonds and allies and started making a name for himself over time he was able to recruit others to his cause vandregon now is a true power in mardrun william and other members of the vandregon army have been at the forefront of many great battles the roads are now safer the smaller towns now have trained militias to guard them the glory of vandregon has been restored and people again remember what the colors stand for vandregon has always been a peoples army and now this new vandregon army stand strong as a shield to protect the people of mardrun from all threats   heraldry  maykar dominion tabard or belt flag with white palm tree over white crossed sabers on a blue

in hopes of getting resultsa new chapter after years of decay and financial distress the once great settlement of starkhaven had descended into near ruin many settlers fled to other colonies although the military might of the order of arnath has never recovered from the initial conflict with the ulven and the recent ulven civil war a handful of the fist chapter members maintain control of starkhaven and can be seen periodically they have become more reclusive now choosing to stay inside their crumbling keep and keep to their ideals and themselves instead of getting involved in the world at large this had concerned members of the order and also some of the people of starkhaven and a griffin stepped forward to push for a reform a new direction was presented and the hand of arnath listened although the order of arnaths fist would remain the primary chapter of the order on mardrun a new settlement and some of the existing military units were repurposed with aiding the efforts of this new chapter the hand of arnath is leaving the future of the order of arnath up to faith and chance whichever chapter proves to be more influential will be allocated more resources and grown and expanded the order of arnaths light is a brand new chapter of the order of arnath led by the new chapter master this group within starkhaven is pushing for more form progressive ideals on the world and diplomacy this was originally met with resistance as the surviving chapter of the order of arnath was the fist the most militant chapter of all of the order of arnath the new light chapter resides

are all of that and more they represent a way of life born again in a new world officially the archons consider themselves a mages guild however the exact agenda and nature of the archons and their home remain a mystery to outsiders fiercely independent the archons recognize no outside authority and enforce very few internal rules internally promoting freedom and individuality while relatively apathetic to the outside world the archons are extremely loyal to one another membership in the organization being considered the equivalent of immediate blood relation despite claims to be a mages guild individual members are encouraged to explore their own talents to become an exemplar of whatever field they choose to practice whether that be magic swordplay a craft or a trade they are also encouraged to pursue their own goals independent of any higher agenda the group may have the archons were founded in the year 263 by a small collection of mages funded by private interests it appealed human refugees and ulven willing to challenge their cultural norms to expand their knowledge of magic together with various misfits from all races and walks of life they formed a commune and began construction of the spire a great structure atop a mountain to house their organization a site rumor holds is home to some latent magical power though not necessarily religious the archons practice a philosophy of openmindedness selfimprovement and spirituality an attitude drawing from syndar faith maykar understanding and some exotic foreign philosophy members are occasionally observed outside the spire deep in meditation or performing magical rites what do you know of magic we are those who looked through the mana and saw all that ever was and would be we have seen war peace times of plenty and famine we have seen the bloom of summer and the decay of winter we saw every childs laughter every mothers cry and every sunrise we learned that no individual could master all magic but each could master both aspects we learned that to possess true power one must seek enlightenment through dedication and understanding and the understanding of the duality of arcane and divine upon this revelation we felt to our knees and wept wept knowing we had at last found the answers we sought and they were beautiful and we finally knew the true taste of perfect cider on a warm summers eve archmage vazra on directions to townwho are the rangers the rangers were once an elite vandregonian group on the old continent back before it was overrun by undead although most of them died fighting to hold the line some of them survived and made it to the new continent one of these survivors was captain ben delgreen after the loss of most of his unit he made his way to one of the last evacuation ships and left his home upon getting to the new continent he began to make a new life for himself with his old skills as a ranger captain he did a lot of jobs that took him close to unsafe conditions these jobs paid well and he bought a small house in a village near newhope he always loved the outdoors and would often leave to hunt in the woods it was on one of these hunts that he found a burning ulven village with memories of the undead attacks he had a flashback to his friends and family falling in battle lost in the haze he walked around for a bit until he found a young ulven boy standing in the ashes of what was once his home after trying to talk to the young kid he decided to take him in and raise him as his own knowing that if he didnt the boy would die he then named the ulven tobias after a few years went by it was clear that town life did not work well for tobias the town did not fully accept him particularly the children who made it a point to make life for him hard some even went so far as to attack him since he could take them one on one they fought unfairly in numbers after seeing this ben made plans to leave and live in the forest these plans were almost done and all he needed was to buy some lumber but before he could he and his son were kicked out of the town earlier that day tobias had beaten up the mayors son in retaliation for many of the group attacks against him he then loaded up what they owned and left for the forest upon getting to their new home ben saw that tobias was happier and seemed to share his love for the woods they both began work to get the lumber needed to make their cabin three months went by and they were almost done all that was left was the roof as tobias was getting the last tree cut he was attacked by three mordok he would have died were it not for ben who thankfully was bringing tobias food for his break at the time of the attack ben unfortunately didnt have his armor or weapons with him the three mordok gave him a run for his silver and almost killed him at the last moment when all was almost lost he summoned up all of his rage and cut the mordok down even with the mordok dead they werent safe yet as one of the mordok had bitten ben in the arm poisoning him with its last moments after some herbs and help from an old maykar friend back at the town he lived but lost his arm because of this he felt that now was a good time to train tobias seeing that it wasnt the safest in the woods tobias had many questions one of them being how had he learned to fight like that ben told him about vandregon the war with the undead and lastly about the rangers ben then spent the last of his days training tobias to be a ranger showing him how to collect plants for healing how to fight and the rules of being a ranger he told tobias there were five rules that every ranger needed to follow one fight smart and run fast two always have a plan three no plan survives contact with the enemy and four leave no ranger behind he didnt tell him the last one saying it wasnt time for him to know after a few years of this bens wounds finally caught up with him it was upon his death bed that he told tobias the fifth and last rule of the rangers after this he passed on from this world tobias built a pyre and buried his fathers ashes after this he sought out others like him finding people to join him wasnt as easy as hed hoped but after a year of searching he found puckermen from that moment it all started to fall into place a few months later the rangers found their home in a small town called crows landing this small town almost didnt make it through the winter that year but thanks to the rangers they survived in thanks they offered their home to them and asked that the rangers take over running the town from its old leaders the rangers gladly accepted and from there have made great improvements to the town tobias hopes to make his father proud of the new rangers and to one day see his home freed of the undead what are the 5 rules of being a ranger 1 fight smart run fast 2 always have a plan 3 no plan survives contact with the enemy 4 leave no ranger behind 5 at this point only tobias knows what the 5th rule is what are their ranks there are 7 ranks within the rangers the commander the keeper wardens seekers hunters brotherssisters and mercs within the wardens seekers hunters and mercs there are the elders members elders are just that they have the most experience in that group the order of command goes the commander the keeper and the four elders for the most part orders will come from the commander or the keeper rarely however they can come from one of the elders the commanderthe commander is the highest rank within the rangers his dutys include maintaining the day to day life of the settlement managing the troops balancing the books and many other things tobias finds tedious at events the commander will talk with whoever is in charge and from there decide how the rangers will respond it is the commanders job to keep everyone at crows landing and every ranger safe its this single duty that he takes to heart he will bleed and die for position held by tobias delgreen played

highest ranking member of the rangers if for some reason the commander is busy or otherwise indisposed the keeper then takes charge at events the keeper will keep the other rangers together and give them direction while the commander is elsewhere the keeper is looked to in matters of magic it is the keepers goal to master all forms a magic in mastering it he can then keep everyone safe as well as train the ranger that wish to learn the art of magic position held by puckerman played by jake bollig description human wearing a green hooded tunic and walks with a heavy limp known skills master cleric witch in training and shield trained status active wardensthe protectors and shields of the rangers wardens are known for being strong well versed warriors whether it be with cold hard steel arrows all the way to magic wardens are the rearguard of the rangers their role is all about holding the line and being the last to retreat wardens are sent to many battle grounds because of this most of them are hardened veterans with dark humor and little patience despite this you would be hard pressed to find a better warrior to fight by your side elder position held by nikoli bellfire played by julian boehm description ulven wearing a green hooded cutoff known skills advance duel welding two handed weapons archery he also brews an amazing apple pie status active seekersseekers are the more magic and knowledge inclined members of the rangers they are mostly used in support roles to help the other ranks they are also sent out on light scoutingrecovery missions they are well know for being seekers of knowledge this is what led to their name most of them can be found studying magic arts or reading vast lore tomes for a seeker a day without learning something new is a day wasted elder position last held by kathena played by ashlee nelson status inactive huntershunters are the eyes and ears of the rangers they task themselves with dangerous scouting missions as well as being the rangers vanguard into battles hunters are survivalists at heart and as such have a vast array of skills to aid them these skills range from magic weapon mastery to even underhanded tactics hunters can be tasked with difficult missions that involve a lot of running so most of them travel light a hunters job is to always be ready for they never know what dangers may lie ahead elder position last held by elijah cole played by kevin novy status inactive mercs the ranger are known for helping where they can however they only have some many members because of this the commander began to hire on mercs these mercs are hired on for anywhere from a month to a year at a time they are paid in silver supplies and or other goods and services as they arent full members of the rangers they have been known to sometime act out or the rangers norm and bring on trouble for the rangers the commander however will take the bad with the good and deals with them as the bad ones act out elder position held by guthrum played by tim miller description human taller then most and wears a black gambeson with red trim little patience for those that insult him know skills heavy armor two handed and tower shield

member of that group after a few missions the elder member will tell the commander if it is a good fit from there they will begin training to become a full member of the group what are some of their goals the goals of the rangers are to keep their home and allies safe from harm to bring back the honor and glory of the rangers they do this by helping out when and where they can they are known to show little mercy to bandits and murderers which has lead to some seeing them in a bad light however in the end the rangers are just trying to make the world a better and safer place ranger kit every ranger must have hisher kit on himher at all times a standard kit will have 3 light wound bandages 2 mortal wounds bandages and 2 mend strips a ranger can add different things to his or her kit but at

long since lost we must start anew and rebuild what was lost to a greater glory our people shall be refined by this fire that has consumed so many the ways of old shall be cast aside our caste system and all beliefs have damned us previously and must be corrected the error of our ways was shrouded in tradition and hidden in plain sight our desire is to bridge the gap of the races and unify to bring about a greater calling all the races as one damn the caste and damn our ways with our combined efforts we can become greater than we ever have before a unity of the races as one people is what we strive for we shall do what we can because we must for the sake of us all we will use our patrons political ties to further our connections for the sake of the greater good we are working out of the syndar district of new hope we have adopted the raven as our symbol for it is a symbol of knowledge the history the founding of the ravens happened after the exodus fro faedrun had taken a heavy toll on the founder alestear he had his faith shaken to the core by the sorrow that came from the loss of his home and of most of his people but this fear and horror lead him to a new belief that the syndar could be saved by unifying the races under one banner alestear along with his former student phaedra worked to bring themselves back from their losses they gained work for celestial arragones as her liaisons and representatives to the people they then worked at gathering others of a like mind to themselves finding oberon who had come to believe that anything could be accomplished with all of the races working together as one after seeing the joint efforts of the ulven humans and syndar to remove the lich from their now homelands alestear and oberon have worked hard to bring the common people to light and show them what can be done with combined efforts they have done their best to gather and bring about the best of the people they have gathered with the ravens being finalized alestear has been trying to spread their name and their message around the continentpack longfang clan none estimated size 300  400 insignia a white fang on a golden brown field alternately 4 white fangs surrounding the boss of a round shield  pack longfang is a storied pack well known for being amongst the clanless that is renounwed for the quality of their warriors the heart of the pack is built around the defense of civilized mardrun from the mordok that lurk in the dirge swamp the public face of the longfang has historically been seen as the warriors who draw attention to themselves without meaning to but the pack also includes a strong contingent of daughters of gaia and hunters in addition to civilian support staff such as farmers and other craftsman aside from a brief period spanning less than 2 years longfang does not have a chieftain and is instead headed by a runeseer the pack functions through the division of tasks into three groups and the individuals devoted to those tasks are grouped into castes the runeseer in addition to leading the pack as a whole heads gaias caste consisting primarily of daughters of gaia the hunters caste handles intelligence and ranged combat the largest caste is that of the warriors who protect both the pack and mardrun from any threats within their power to stop historically longfang also pledged warriors as honor guards to war leaders witches and high priestesses but this practice fell from favor in the later years of runeseer solvig longfangs tenure as leader she withdrew the various honor guards from the clans and packs prior to the civil war the stresses of that war and longfangs attempts to become a more traditional pack during chieftain stanrick longfangs time in leadership have led to the practice not being restored   the phoenix people have always been a more nomadic group of syndar always interested in different cultures they are a curious group by nature they carried their goods with them and traded for anything they needed staying mostly in the north while the syndar and humans fought out their differences after the battle of grayfield when peace was established they started to move further to the south seeing what there is to see and meeting these new humans the beginning was touch and go as feelings were still sensitive to the mingling of different races when they came to the maykar desert the humans there were more open and friendly to the syndar as a whole and so the phoenix concentrated on that area of faedrun they traded for what they needed but because they stayed in the area the maykar people started to depend on their repeated arrival with much needed and wanted items within a few decades the phoenix took the desert as their permanent home they used their thick canvas tents to keep out the sand they set them up around a main area that was the common area and held a fire pit they used their personal areas mainly for sleeping and storage they spent most of their time in the common area or traveling visiting anyone who was out there they set up trade routes and the phoenix traveled all over the desert and even to some towns on the edge of the vandregon there the phoenix lived for over 150 years until the year 232 when the magis yara went on her journey of enlightenment when she was on her trip she became dehydrated weak and fevered in that state solara came to her he told her that the undead were never going to leave their lands and were going to overtake her people if they stayed in fadrun solara told her to take his people to safety that they needed to travel east until they met the edge of the world to take boats and continue east until they find a new home he then had a phoenix bring water and food for her to aide her on her way back when she returned and was nursed back to health she told her people the news that they were to leave their land and find land that was promised to them  solaras told them to leave soon but syndar are not a quickly moving race they discussed leaving some of the younger ones used raised voices to discuss there was not a unanimous choice as every syndar chooses their own paths and hearts were saddened and some even broken the trip was the biggest devastation to the phoenix people in their history to move almost all of their people and personal belongings across hundreds of miles in hostile territory some had never been outside of their village they had the help of their camels the beast of burden gave them so much they lost some of the phoenix to desertion and various fighting with humans in aldoria they had trouble with bandits robbing them and soldiers refusing the huge group of syndar to pass threw their lands they had to buy their way across the country until they reached the sea the trip was only half done they needed to cross the sea to get to the land the phoenix were desert dwellers they knew nothing of the sea and how to navigate in it they set upon the task of finding boasts big enough and men to sail them in their search the sailors there jested about the large group of syndar that wanted to take a boat into the emptiness of the ocean very few would even consider helping them and even less once they found out they had no idea where they were going only one captain was willing drunk enough to listen to them and eventually chance sailing off into the unknown but they needed 2 ships to take everyone they sold almost all of their valuables belongings and had to part with all of their camels to secure the ships and used the rest of the money to buy any provisions they could to support them on the voyage they secured a second ship but no other captain was willing to sail it the drunken captain took a handful of phoenix were taught quickly how to sail and were instructed to stay close to the lead ship with everyone loaded most of the coastal town gathered to witness the phoenix leaving a joke ran along the group to look your last as this group will never be seen again days into the trip they hit a storm the ships tried in vain to stay in sight of each other the ship with a captain was blown south of the original course and the ship without a captain was never seen again after the storm they were lost unsure how off course they were blown weeks on a ship with hardly any food hoping they would find the land solaras promised them they became sick some were dying the healers didnt know how to handle sea type sicknesses and there was no way to stave off hunger some began to fear solara had left them thinking they were damned when the unthinkable happened and yara took ill and died some even went so far as to take their lives and jump into the ocean the oldest magis in training raina then one day with the keen eyes of a young syndar land was spotted they landed exhausted and sick they had nothing the people were still dying until shelter and food could be found collected and used a new beginning they found themselves on an island on the southeast side of mardrun the climate was more lush wooded lands with prairies a small lake fed by a spring in the middle of the island the phoenix built their village on the edge of the lake by the outlet so the dirty water would not contaminate the clean some of the phoenix took to the new land quickly building small rooms of wood in the branches of the trees to be off the ground bird like for security some also built their homes on the ground not comfortable with the idea of heights they built a temple for solaras magis raina used the temple as her home and to also train the new magis there are only a few in training they are assigned a guard who stays with them day and night it is an old practice that even fewer guards took seriously the captain stayed with them for a while treated extremely well but after a time he decided it was time to try to get home the phoenix loaded his ship with all they could and wished him luck on his journey back as he left he was seen shaking his head with a smile muttering wait until they hear this back in faedrun ill be famous  wild animals were smaller being contained on the island the phoenix changed their diet to include a lot of fresh grown produce with the rich and fertile soil rabbits were plentiful on the new land the phoenix were careful not to over harvest they found guineas for eggs and goats were domesticated for dairy and fur without the humans and trading they became more self sufficient as hunters and gatherers they are alone on the island they provided what they needed to survive metal weapons slowly became scarce they were forced to make them out of wood limiting what they could hunt for they leaned heavily on bow and arrows when a sword broke the metal was transformed into smaller throwing daggers they made a modest but content life on the island the once buoyant and outgoing group was now trapped on the island with no one else to talk to and trade stories with they lived this way for 24 years in the spring of the year 261 a couple of phoenix were out in one of the small boats they had fashioned for fishing a doll washed up on the side of their boat they picked it up it was definitely not made by their people they sat still listening and watching they heard voices very far away and almost just almost maybe it was just an active imagination they could see an outline of a boat because more then one phoenix saw and heard it they took it to magis raina who called a meeting they knew there were more people what race and who they were they had no idea they sat in council and talked about what they should do for syndar it was a fairly fast discussion and quickly decided to find them and meet these new people but how they didnt have big boats they had small ones they had learned to build to gather fish in the deeper waters of the sea would it be big enough who would go what if they got lost several wanted to go and volunteered most were younger syndar who were looking for adventure and had been very young when they left their old land and have not met anyone since magis raina wanted a small party to go meet them and see if they were a hospitable race raina looked out across the meeting area and saw anariel talking with a larger bluerainbow colored bird that are found on the island she is a level headed dependable and very polite shes inquisitive and understanding of peoples feelings and would represent her people well even if she does get side tracked easily she better send laertes with her hes older and can help keep her on track his keen mind and fairness also works in his favor to gain trust with others both were seasoned fighters but she needed more for a welcoming party looking to her side she decided on celeste her most promising magis in training was highly skilled in healing and could come in handy when traveling maybe if any of the people they were meeting was hurt then celeste could help them and further their favor and with adding celeste thorn was also added to the list as he was her personal body guard and just last month they had a ceremony to be joined and raina knew from experience she would not be able to separate them had she wanted to which suited her fine as thorn was a proven fighter and would protect celeste with his life she gathered the group of four to represent her people and sent them off with a brief prayer to solara for protection and a prosperous trip as they came near the shore they heard the sound of a small village they were humans they called out their greeting and stopped the boat just outside of arrow range if these new people had felt the need to use them and also out of respect anariel hailed to them they saw the initial surprise from the group when they noticed them the hustle after to get the one in charge and more people came out to see what was going on it looked to be a smaller human settlement then assumingly the man in charge came out to the shore he was a taller man dark hair dressed in black plate mail with a red bird on the front of it also by his side another man came he was lighter in hair color wearing leather both had swords on their side they talked briefly to each other then told the small boat to approach as the boat hit land the humans gave the syndar room to disembark they stood watching each other until anariel spoke greetings we come from an island not far away we call ourselves the phoenix we have come here to greet you help you and to kindle a partnership in hopes that we can help each other i have brought with me laertes celeste who is a healer if anyone here needs help she is more then happy to see to them thorn who is her sworn protector and myself anariel how may we assist you greetings and well met my name is aradael and this is fortinbras our village is known as crows landing if you would like to have your healer celeste can go with my wife amalthia to see if anyone is in need of her help if you and laertes would like to follow me we can sit down break bread and talk the group talked for hours and had many things to share aradael was surprised to learn that the phoenix were secluded on an island not knowing of the world around them he told them they were next to a much larger land called mardrun telling them of how his people had landed here after a storm and had made their living he spoke of the mordok and ulven that are contained on mardrun he then turned to much darker topics of the ulven civil war that seemed to be on the horizon and of the undead showing up on mardrun in april when everyone had thought they had escaped them on mardrun laertes and anariel were shocked to hear that the undead the ones they had fled their home lands for lost over half of their people to avoid had followed them this was bad very bad they had to get back to raina and soon she had to be told of this with thanks to their newly found friends and promises to return they headed back to the island and called a meeting telling raina all that they had found out we must do something it is not our land or our problem how is it not humans were our friends our allies you mean the aldorians who charged us just to cross their lands they can deal with it themselves we should stay here on our island solaras gave us this island for our home to be safe not all humans were aldorians were you not listening these men who welcomed us were aldorians no all aldorians are bad we have to do something if the undead followed them across the water they will stop at nothing until we are all dead raina stood up after a while of listening to everyone voice their opinions my children i know this is a shock to many of us first to find others then to hear of whole world we are missing and then to hear that the undead are also here yes we are safe on our island but for how long they followed the living here they will just keep coming until they are stopped you know solaras is kind and has provided for us but what have we done to give back for our good fortune how would he look at us if we turned our back on our newly found allies from what we have been told the ulven are a mix just like the humans some are good and some are bad dont we have a responsibility to help those less than us solara will lead us gently in a way he feels is best for us but it is up to us to make the most of it so we can show him that we deserve to be born again from our ashes also perhaps if there is more land out there maybe our lost brothers and sisters are out there thinking we were lost to them maybe they made it to the new land will we not look for them she looked out upon her people we will help them but we will not run in blindly laertes and anariel will continue to speak to crows landing and gather any information that we can we will decide who will go out of the first trip to see and gather information perhaps we can start a trade with them to get steel and offer them our food and healing supplies lets show solaras we are worthy of his love and attention over the next few months a small group of phoenix trained and gathered supplies for their journey crows landing has told them what they knew they havent heard much from grimward but to still be wary of them the lich has been sighted his power source was destroyed and now a group is going after it to finish it off as soon as they could the phoenix planned on helping the group destroy the lich in any way possible they loaded extras for healing with raina giving them a blessing for solara to look after them the group climbed in the boats to head to crows landing and from there the unknown when the captain returned to faedrun no one believed his wild claims of finding a new land they assumed he was gone on a drinking binge he died in poverty with his tales being left as rumors phoenix faq characteristics they are considered serous syndar they have normal colored skin no horns but vary from syndar to syndar with small fangs and bright colored eyes facial tattoos clothing is more regal dignified they try to emulate the phoenix and use red gold orange and black wispy flowing clothing origin  the maykar dominion housing thick canvas tents some were in a traveling caravan population believed to be around 250300 members now closer to 100120 life expectancy average life expectancy is 185 years old though it has been said that a member of phoenix has lived to the age of 201 years old she claims it is because she had a healthy diet of wirbles slugs that has helped her stay so young and energetic politics they live as a commune the phoenix people have been looked down upon by other syndar for deciding to cater to the humans with their caravan when they lived in the maykar dominion because of this they are not as welcome in the syndar politics which suit the phoenix just fine they care for the survival of their people and care little else for what others think of them life styleliving they have a main village at one of the oases in the maykar dominion and smaller villages around the desert at different oasis they make a living hunting what scarce game they find using traps and snares and having a group of members who operate a traveling caravan going from oasis to oasis sharing and trading food and goods to humans that live in the area the phoenix people are very community orientated everyone helps out everyone and living is very comfortable they do have their own heavy tents made of canvas but they are small mostly used for sleeping most of the syndar socialize in the center of the oasis water when the water in the oasis would start to get low the phoenix would gather around the well and channel their energy into the earth while the magis would ask solaras for more water to provide for his children it took a couple of hours but solarus always provided for those who believed their well would fill the phoenix would speak his praise and life could continue raising young children of the phoenix are rare they are cherished and doted on because of this they raise their children as a community everyone helps out there is nothing happier to hear in life then the laughter of a child each child is required to take one year of training for magic when they are 10 they are tested to find which magic runs in their veins and then they are divided up for classes after one year it is optional for continuing education mating marriage is not common among syndar they go through a courtship like humans where they try to impress each other if they find the other syndar to their liking they enter a relationship but there are usually no further steps but in rare occasions when two syndar want to join for life it is cause for much celebration syndar do not take joining lightly but still treat it as a blessing when two syndar join they pledge themselves to each other and ask for the blessing of solara they have a great feast and the village celebrates the newly joined couple religion  they worship the sun god solara they believe the phoenix is his pet to be feared and worshiped as an extension of him when a member of phoenix dies they burn the body releasing the spirit to solara to see if they have lived in his honor and accept them so they may be reborn again members who did not honor solara and live in his ways will not be reborn and their spirit will be lost for all ages as serous syndar being born from the elements of the earth the phoenix believe that when solaras made them he used fire as his main element solara also gifted them with arcane magic some do have divine but most tend to have arcane death rituals when a member of the phoenix dies the magis reclaims the mana out of the deceased and back to the mana stones meant for members of the phoenix the clan gathers at the center of the village tribal music is played as the magis prays to solara to accept their spirit into her and to let them be reborn into this world again the body is wrapped in a white clothe and nothing else so they can rise from the ashes pure and new their belongings are not burned with them and left to help care for the family of the mourning or dispersed to the other members as the family sees fit why we came to mardrun around the year 230 the magi was on a trip of enlightenment in the desert where the phoenix commune used to live in fadrun when she was on her trip she became dehydrated weak and fevered in that state solara came to her he told her that the undead were never going to leave their lands and were going to overtake her people if they stayed in fadrun solara told her to take his people to safety that they needed to travel east until they met the edge of the world to take boats and continue east until they find a new home he then had a phoenix bring water and food for her to aide her on her way back arguments arouse when the magis told the people of what she had learned a lot of the people wanted to stay and live life as they always had while others knew the magis wouldnt lie after days of debating and arguing they could not come to a compromise so with many tears some of the phoenix stayed while most of them left in search for this new land they were promised they were used to traveling in the harsh desert and made it across the maykar desert easily with use of their camels after that the trip became very hard and long for the people of the phoenix they had a few small skirmishes with the humans as they made their way across the aldorian kingdom the humans in the maykar dominion were nice and welcoming while the aldorians were mistrustful and unwilling to help a group of refugees of this size they lost some of the phoenix to desertion and various fighting with humans once they had made it to the end of the world they were to take a boat across to the new promised land the sailors there jested about the large group of syndar that wanted to take a boat into the emptiness of the ocean only one captain was willing drunk enough to chance sailing off into the unknown but they needed 2 ships to take everyone they sold almost of their valuables and all of their camels securing the ships and used the rest of the money to buy any provisions to support them on the voyage they secured a second ship but no other captain was willing to sail it a group of phoenix were taught quickly how to sail and were instructed to stay close to the lead ship on the trip they hit a storm the ships tried in vain to stay in sight of each other the ship with a captain was blown south of the original course and the ship without a captain was never seen again after the storm they were lost weeks on a ship with hardly any food hoping they would find the land solaras promised them they became sick some were dying the healers didnt know how to handle sea type sicknesses and there was no way to stave off hunger some began to fear solara had left them thinking they were damned then one day with the keen eyes of a young syndar land was spotted they landed on an island exhausted and sick they had nothing the people were still dying until shelter and food could be found collected and used a new beginning origin  an island on the southeast side of mardrun climate was more lush wooded lands with prairies a small lake fed by a spring in the middle of the island the phoenix built their village on the edge of the lake by the outlet so the dirty water would not contaminate the clean housing small rooms built of wood in the branches of the trees to be off the ground bird like for security they are very intricate and beautifully carved some also built their homes on the ground not comfortable with the idea of heights but still has the same attention to detail with the carvings and flowing quality life styleliving without the humans and trading they became hunters and gatherers they are alone on the island they provided what they needed to survive metal weapons were scarce they were forced to make them out of wood limiting what they could hunt for they lean heavily on bow and arrows but after meeting with crows landing they were able to secure some swords after trading was established greetings

the year 261 after struggling with the decision to pay the price that must be paid in order to activate the blade he willingly sacrificing himself after being the focus of a complicated ritual and contemplating his life and purpose venator channeled his life essence through a maykar paladin blade to create a divine weapon strong enough to destroy the lich after reciting the power words to finish the ritual venator charged the lich and fought it in melee combat the lich was no match for venators skill with the blade and the lich was struck and the spell activation complete in a flash of blinding light and a thunderous boom the divine magic ripped through venators body and completely destroyed the lich the following shockwave tearing through the energy holding the liches minions together and causing them to crumble through venators sacrifice the lich was stopped and the undead plague on mardrun destroyed before it truly began bio venator was born to the old pack dreadfang and was the son of the dreadfangs chieftain darius dreadfang venator was trained at a young age in the art of combat and was trained to be skilled in all aspects of weapons and their uses as well as excelling in physiological intimidation venator from birth was promised to the oathkeeper brotherhood to uphold a blood oath to protect all the adjacent packs around his home by his father he would join the oathkeeper brotherhood a group dedicated to the protection of those who cant protect themselves thus gave him the title oathkeeper from then on he wasnt a dreadfang rather a guardian but as years went on he came to despise the packs he was guarding but he knew his fathers oath would cause venator to suffer the same fate if he were to break it however venator discovered a loop hole in the oath he would need to let all the packs die off and then he would be rid of this burden so when the pack feel under attack by a group of mordok he left them to die however one of the pack leaders escaped and came to venators father and explained what had happened after hearing this darius was furious and ordered under penalty of death to go and clear out the mordok venator planed for this he tackled him through the wall in their hut blinded with fury he took his sword and was about to slit his throat when venators mother intervened still blinded by rage venator stabs her through the heart darius was shocked and he calls for an honor duel with venator their battle lasted only 3 minutes venator over powered darius with his strength and skill venator pressed darius to the point of exhaustion darius could feel the exhaustion setting in he would loss however he called the rest of the pack to defend him and chased venator out of the camp months later venator finds his packs new settlement still vengeful he waits till night fall then sets fire to the camp darius is enraged and calls out to venator for revenge his response and the last words venator says to his father are  dont worry darius this is only the beginning to my victory for weeks in my travels i have been followed by a very persistent human with many annoying questions to ask me at one point he had asked if i was dishonored for not having the honor of most ulven warriors this question annoyed and angered me but i knew just as rat like him does that he would surly ask me again till i answered i stared him down and answered his insignificant question no i do not feel at all dishonored or cheated by that is it good to be known and feared but to not be know but remain that thought in the back of ones head that if they were to cross me would they know that is what i enjoy most now i know im not the greatest fighter at the least i can hold my own but my mother did not just give me a sturdy body to wield a sword and shield but a cunning mind to find ways of taking some of the pressure off he looks at me with a confused look shall i explain further very well a true fight is indeed partly won by being a better fighter than another but if you could beat that better stronger fighter before he even draws a sword now that is something deadly its true that in battle truth is the first to die creating a grand deception that travels by the tongue of another till it has past through the minds of many its the mystery of not knowing all ulven are taught this and i sometimes wounder if humans are to know thine enemies well what if they are a cloud of smoke and some were in it is something lurking waiting that you can not see this is what keeps all those curious away unless they have been told before by the one who knows the truth which leads me to wounder why you are here following me venator draws his weapon so were is the one who told you of me and dont try and run youll be lost out here for weeks before someone finds you if they find you so human were is darius dreadfang to long has the swamp been my home from the time of my insurgence at the longfang camp and onsallas outpost and after all that happens i meet one as strange ulven as i have ever meet he greeted me as a friend and asked to speak to me in private i had take 3 of my mermiden and 10 vandregon footmen to a village on the verge of being attacked by the graytides but i made time to speak to this ulven to my honor he was one ulven i grew up with and fought with his pack was right next to my own as a child he spoke with much the same tone as his father venator i know events to take place soon will cut this conversation short the graytides are making hast here they will attack within the hour but i needed to speak with you urgently he reminded me much of myself as a younger form i know what you have done youre past youre legacy is drenched in youre own kins blood tell me do you still seek the last surviving ulven ever since i escaped the swamp with my life i had been fearing this day to come as a younger me i sought to work on the shadows but with my new duties i am not allowed that luxury but this ulven has been kind enough not to be an executioner of my deeds and he deserves an answer sighs i have but gave up on my search for my father my time in the dirge has shown me that vain hatred and childish grudges will inevitably be my own destruction its been a decade since my insertion to the oathkeepers and 2 years since i set out to destroy my kin i have been to near to death than i would like in the swamp i thought the great wolf was trying to punish me but through it all i have emerged stronger smarter calmer i have come to grips with the fact that my own vendetta is unsavory a quality for the mermidens leader it is obvious that darius is all to good at running and hiding for me to try and pursue him all my life instead i have decided to disown this crusade of death and with it i give up the title of oathkeeper maybe in the future after i have given all i have the great wolf will come to know my name and return me to a dreadfang but a dreadfang of honor and of legend rogar bursts into the clearing venator we need to go now the graytides are over running us this camp site is doomed we need to get the villagers to safety agreed gather scarlet and franklin along with the all the vandregon we brought tell them to escort to warriors and their families to safety go now rogar as you said there isnt any time to waste i looked back to my associate i hate to leave this conversation

pack longfang fulfilled an honor debt to clan stormjarl and helped defend their settlements and protect their warriors during the clan grimward invasion of the winter of the year 262 after months of skirmish fighting and retreating back to the main clan stormjarl settlement the pack longfang warriors stayed to help protect the final remaining settlement when clan grimward warriors launched an all out attack in march of 263 pack longfang warriors sacrificed their lives to defend the main route into the settlement and keep clan grimward from massacring the illequipped stormjarl militia stationed nearby with brutal and savage fighting raging for hours almost nonstop pack longfang warriors were slaughtered almost completely only a handful of warriors were dragged back to the healers the elite

the great wolf said branthur when he laid his hands on his cousins second born son throm should be his name let it be a name of strength and sturdiness little did branthur know what his cousin would have sired for some time for the first years throms life was like that of normal ulven children but when he became the age of 7 his personality of a bright eyed boy filled with laughter changed completely to a boy that was stern and obsessed with challenging himself by the time he was 9 he would was as strong as his eldest brother whom was 14 at the time this frightened throms mother but it only amazed gorm branthurs cousin even more at the bloodline he has sired over the years he brawled fought and skirmished with males in his clan and others till eventually he was 21 when the colonists appeared his father came to him and handed him large two headed axe and said go forth and show them the true might of the ulven show these foreigners what it means to stare into the maw of the great wolf throm gladly took up that mantle and accelled at doing so the warpack consisted of some of the best warriors from each clan leading them to victory after victory this warpack soon gained a nickname among the colonists hell hound when the watchwolf treaty was signed though the war pack was disbanded and left throm to lead the occasional assualt or reconnesance against mordok tribes in the great forest and great wolf hackles this bored him greatly it brought no thrill to his hunt to his story that he would some day tell this led to throm venturing into the woods to try and find a challenge worth his time then grimward began to invade the west watchwolves invade stormjarl and attack colonists when branthur took up arms to defend his guests he had throm stay back and police the territory train and moblizie warpacks and prepare them for holding back grimward this didnt please throm in the slightest even though it is considered taboo for ulven to fight one another he still felt that what he was doing was wasting his time earlier in the year 264 throm went to branthur and demanded he be allowed to go help stormjarl where two of his brothers and sisters were currently

than just the words people tell you words do not always match peoples actions and the truth often lies somewhere in between words and action but you dont really care to hear about my job that i suppose is another story you want to know about me i was born in a place call everspring grove in clan spiritclaw territory its the largest settlement in the territory most of the colonists have a specific word for that kind of settlement  a capitol to me it is the place where the clan leader and the high priestess are located so that makes it the place i need to report back to regularly we visited it often when i was a child my childhood was only somewhat typical for a ulven  my father was a truth seeker as am i so this required us to travel a lot the entire family would go with him on hist travels for company support and security my mother was from pack fenrir and had the spirit of a warrior so there was no way she was going to let him go off alone anyway it was either all or nothing with my family i learned to read and write as all truth seekers need to to do by the age of 10 at 14 gaia blessed me by choosing me as a conduit for her love the first time her power flowed through me i saved my younger brother from a stab wound he received during what suppose to be just a friendly wrestling match my grandmother oversaw my training as a daughter while my father taught me how to find the truth around me i received my markings at the age of 16 my cousins teased me mercilessly at that years pack thing saying that i didnt have the great wolfs favor and that he was going to eat me on my journey since i only received small fangs as my marks  my eyes did not yet show the grace of the great wolf despite gaias gifts to me it is believed at least among my pack that the physical blessings of the great wolf indicate his favor the truth of it is something we may never know as no one knows until they go meet the great wolf i like to think it just means i resemble the great mother more then the great wolf i took a mate at 23 torolf had followed us for weeks trying to convince my father to teach him father finally agreed after a month of persistent pestering there are not many truth seekers outside of the clan spiritclaw so his pack and clan would see this as a noble feat i watched him closely during that time his arguments were sound and his determination echoed in everything he had done he showed that he was a capable hunter as well bringing four grouse when he tried to win my favor he did not lack in martial ability either beating my brother in combat i dont think my brother was trying very hard but i never mentioned that to torolf his pursuit was flattering  especially from one who was so attractive our son asgier was born five years later under the moon of the tale singer he began to speak early  and incredibly eloquently  so i believe he shall one day find a path to use this gift everything changed last year dad was on a journey he had been gone for quite some time and hadnt told us what he was doing we had bartered for shelter in one of the settlement near the dirge swamps for the night the plan was to get some pineed sap the following day to make more bandages for trade that didnt happen we were in the wrong place at the wrong time we had picked one of the settlements that the lich and his army came through my entire family was killed and i was grievously injured by those horrors the worst though was the fate of the child i was carrying as i was four months pregnant at the time get me drunk enough and i may tell you the more gory details but without the shield of alcohol the memory is almost too painful to relate i clung to life long enough for my cousin to find me hours later clan spritclaw sent some daughters to aid the forces that had gathered to fight the lich in the final push she found me among the rubble and stayed with me while we did rites for everyone some of the settlements residents survived either by dumb luck or the good sense to stay hidden my cousin asked me to take them someplace safe since i was in no shape to help with the lich so we fled as quickly as we could thankfully i later heard that the lich was defeated his evil gone from the land i traveled back to everspring grove and told the clan leader and high priestess what happened to my family they were mortified by what had happened and bade me to go mourn and rest in the safety of the settlement i was working in the kitchen of the local tavern when my cousin  a guard for the clan leader  came to get me saying i was summoned i was told to take the place of my father and to seek the truth in the ulven civil war rumors have run rampant for years and concern is growing so i wander watching learning trying to

bloodfang troops train quietly watching them from the cover of an apple tree while his parents slept over the years he became bolder sneaking closer so as to hear them talking he came to know each by name and even found a wooden stick about the same length as a sword that he used to mimic their movements while training one of them his cousin kreiger bloodfang was the one orrin liked to watch the most orrin would often imagine that he stood beside kreiger battling mordok while he watched one night after a few years of this orrin was swinging his sword when he landed a solid blow on the nearest tree making a loud thud the bloodfangs grabbed their weapons and looked about for the source of the noise orrin frightened by the suddenness ran back to his fathers house kreiger must have seen him run for only a few minutes after the breathless orrin returned home kreiger stepped inside after explaining the situation to his startled parents kreiger looked at orrin and asked so you wish to be a bloodfang orrin at a loss for words only nodded his father began to speak up but quickly went silent with a look from kraiger orrin could be of use to us let him come with us to see if he really is the warrior he believes he is should be an easy task we need a fourth man to help guard a caravan bringing supplies after a few hours of discussion and with his fathers blessing orrin left with the bloodfangs to see if his place truly was among them orrin was later traded to pack longfangplayed by nik draco knight name nikolai longfang gender male age 17 race ulven hair brown eyes one eye is

in his life he was traded to pack longfang along with one of his fellow pack members wigwald both nikolai and wigwald were looked over due to their somewhat lack of size and stature to most other longfang members but both ulven worked hard to be the best however only nikolai rose to the title of a longfang warrior since his becoming a warrior nikolai has fought with the longfang for years and has been in many battles however his presence at the grimmward summit is the most noteworthy so far in his life months before the summit nikolai spent most of his time helping wigwald improve his skills already being a full fledged warrior nikolai expected his companion to grow and improve fast and after weeks of training he was showing improvement but not enough to be considered a better warrior nikolai sympathized wigwald remembering his own troubles with being smaller then most ulven as training went on the days got closer and closer to the upcoming summit and when the day finally came when the longfang set out to the summit wigwald begged nikolai to bring him with so when the time came to attend the summit nikolai brought wigwald nikolai describes the summit as one of the worst days in his life for at the summit conflict arose between the longfang and graytides so much that nikolai was caught in the eye by a javelin luckily his shield stopped the blunt of the javelin however during this engagement khulgar graytide killed wigwald this angers nikolai he was angered that the graytide other ulven would take the life of another who was working for his place as a

to grimward and conquered one of their small settlements without support they were forced to retreat back to the watchwolf settlement longstanding allies the warriors of pack bloodfang refused to leave the side of the watchwolves in their darkest hour they pledged to stay and fight with them no matter the cost as the ranks of grimward charged in after the spring thaw pack bloodfang stood defiantly against them inflicting terrible losses on the grimward invaders the bloodfang warriors fought dearly and made clan grimward pay for every inch in blood dozens of warriors were killed before the remaining bloodfangs were wounded enough to be taken out of the fight which fueled their tenacity and their howls of rage were heard far down the battle line watchwolf defenders were unable to support them fully and without the rest of the coalition or their supplies to aid them pack bloodfangs warriors were killed to a man krieger bloodfang was one of the last to fall covered in blood and gore and swinging his large sword amongst numerous enemies until he also fell in battle when the fight finally ended warriors of both the watchwolves and grimward took a moment to respect the fallen warriors with honor and both sides were even permitted to be a part of the massive funeral pyre that was lit that evening sending off some of the most ferocious warriors known to the ulven kreiger and his brother marr lived togather with their mother and father krieger was only an infant when they were ambushed by a group of mordok his mother and father were killed in the attack leaving kreiger and his older brother marr alone to hide from the mordok luckily a hunting party from the nearby watchwolves of sol were passing through and managed to fend of the mordok and get the two youths to safety seeing that these orphans needed a home kreiger was adopted by a family in the eastern watchwolf village while marr was sent south to be adopted by a different clan he has always remembered this kindness and despite his new affiliation he still counts the watchwolves as close friends the years since this tragedy went by smoothly he has no adopted siblings other than his younger cousin orrin up in the western watchwolf settlement kreiger often visited the young lad and they have become great friends kreigers visits into the watchwolves of luna territory has led him to meet raskolf vakr whom has become a good friend and advisor to the younger ulven over the years kreiger started to display great amounts of aggression around the age of ten he would often pick fights just for the sheer sport of it this love for fighting often would get kreiger in more trouble than his adopted parents wanted  a certain amount of roughandtumble play was expected of the young after all to give the child a better direction his adopted father started to teach kreiger how to wield a short sword as the years went by his frame grew and with it his preference in weapons eventually leading him to a large twohanded blade it wasnt long after that his love for battle and fighting drove kreiger to become a better fighter than his father this training had helped to straighten up the rowdy kid and allowed him to better serve his people by joining hunting parties and defending his home from mordok attack despite the tempering of discipline kreigers love for battle still raged deep inside his heart this attitude eventually caught the eye of the fangs of kyrkogrim when he turned sixteen kreiger was approached by an ulven warrior named victor  the leader of a newlyformed war pack called the bloodfang victor asked kreiger to join the war pack and come with them to combat some invaders that have arrived by boat kreiger jumped at this opportunity shortly after that kreiger had learned that his older brother marr was also asked to join despite their years of separation the two quickly became great friends and soon started to relate as siblings  a fierce rivalry developed between them the two would constantly try to prove that they were better than the other this became more of a game and pastime as the years grew on kreiger continues to go back to his home to spend time with his family and catch up on things with his old friends he also tries to make it out to visit his cousin and catch up with raskolf these visits happen less often due to his new obligations to the bloodfang but whenever he gets the chance kreiger tries his best to make the most of themharlok longfang of pack longfang clanless son of hanseth longfang harlok grew up in a small village that is connected to and protected by the nearby ulven onsallas outpost which borders the ulven lands near the dirge swamp  update harlok longfang was killed in the battle of blackwolf creek in march of the year 263 the warriors of pack longfang fulfilled an honor debt to clan stormjarl and helped defend their settlements and protect their warriors during the clan grimward invasion of the winter of the year 262 after

militia stationed nearby with brutal and savage fighting raging for hours almost nonstop pack longfang warriors were slaughtered almost completely only a handful of warriors were dragged back to the healers the elite warriors of pack longfang were decimated harlok gave his life in defense of the settlement after standing with his fellow warriors against numerous waves of organized clan grimward invaders after going into a berserker rage and killing several warriors and maiming a handful of others harlok was dragged away from the fight and was to be captured by clan grimward refusing to be captured harlok flew into a final berserker rage and lashed out against any grimward warrior close by his final moments were that of being hacked and stabbed dozens of times as he pulled an enemy down and stabbed him to death with his dagger covered in gore his body mangled and armor broken harlok died with a snarl on his face and a death grip on his scramasax harloks father was in the party of warriors sent as support to the dirge swamp to assist pack blackwing pack longfang then moved to the onsallas outpost village and has made it their permanent settlement as a child harlok was destined for the path of the warrior he excelled at combat and was tenacious taking to the studies of battle and learning from the warriors stationed at the outpost he reveled in combat but was not blinded by fury he is calculating and skilled he also understood that being a warrior does not always mean you have to fight there are numerous duties a warrior must fulfill in defense of his pack and settlement he began to help defend the village and outpost at an early age of 15 and eventually joined in on the hunting parties that would explore parts of the swamp or leave and help other ulven packs veera longfang harloks older sister by 2 years and his only sibling was being trained to become the next witch to lead pack longfang mere days before she was to leave the village and continue her training at another settlement with the clans high priestess the mordok attacked onsallas outpost in a much larger force than usual there was brutal fight that took place at the outpost and inside the village when the mordok punched through the perimeter and started raiding the homes harlok fought hard with his fellow warriors to repel the attack and they were eventually able to kill most of the mordok before the rest retreated into the dirge swamp harlok was cut and bruised but would live but his sister was not as fortunate they found her impaled to a tree by a mordok hunting spear with her throat chewed out and her entrails pulled from her body a mordok shaman had hunted her out specifically and ritualistically killed her to what end no one is sure seeking revenge for not only the loss of his own daughter but of the packs future witch hanseth longfang called for aid from nearby packs and led a large war party of almost a hundred ulven and followed the trail of the mordok into the swamp a week later only about half of the ulven returned but hanseth brought back the severed head of not only the mordok shaman but also of an alpha or the mordok tribes leader when harlok turned 24 years old he was assigned to a hunting party that had tracked a group of mordok into the dirge swamp the mordok ambushed the hunting party and proved larger than expected out of the twenty ulven hunters and warriors sent to attack the mordok the sole survivor was harlok longfang who stumbled back to the perimeter of the outpost and collapsed covered in blood and dirt his armor was shattered and torn he had great wounds that were infected several bones were broken and his tongue had been brutally cut out of his throat he was never able to tell the story of exactly what happened and never will for he is now unable to speak harlok has grown very impatient and abrupt after years of trying to communicate and being frustrated with his inability to do so it took a long time for his wounds to heal so harlok began training and teaching younger ulven growing up in the village near the outpost he also took up numerous watch duties in the row of towers near the village then the colonists began to arrive on mardrun and conflict had broken out with the first ulven parties that scouted out the foreigners pack longfang left onsallas outpost and moved to repel the foreigners from another land harlok was involved in numerous skirmishes and several bloody battles his long fangs helping to lend to the stories of the ulven being demons harloks father was killed in a skirmish between his hunting party and a group of syndar when they retrieved his fathers body they found him surrounded by the bodies of dead syndar there was a bitten off syndar finger nearby which appeared to have belonged to the man who had killed hanseth and survived for there was no corpse that the finger went to by the time the truce was established between the colonists and the ulven harlok had seen plenty of combat and killed numerous colonists he views the humans and syndar as weak and pathetic cowards for abandoning their homeland to the plague that afflicted faedrun but harlok fully respects and abides by the truce any human or syndar that is strong willed or proves themselves in battle alongside or even against the ulven are respected by harlok but all others are treated indifferently or even coldly even 10 years of interaction both hostile and not has not tempered the edge of harloks demeanor towards humans and syndar as a whole since harlok is unable to voice his opinions about the colonists he has taken more of an aloof stance towards any that have not earned his respect he tolerates them for now after the truce pack longfang was sent to intervene and stop another pack after reports of continued fighting reached them they arrived just as pack graytide was killing a caravan of humans that had been traveling from newhope as the confrontation escalated into drawn steel it ended quickly when harlok cleaved the arm clean off at the elbow of lycon graytide the graytides hunting party leader although the graytide leader would live lycon spat curses at the longfangs and vowed to seek revenge most of pack longfang returned to onsallas outpost but harlok left to travel the area harlok is close friends with kragen bloodmoon and azra steelfang and they have battled mordok together on numerous occasions longfang is the dominant family of pack longfang and pack longfang is currently clanlessyou see this this is the end of the world and that that is the dirge swamp

write until my hands bleed i was born into clan watchwolf and raised as any watchwolf would have been raised rough around the edges with a temper to boot i have spent years learning to hold it in until a proper time for its release i was joined with my life mate at a young age and was quite lucky to have a loving mate to be joined to in watchwolf culture we mate for life to one mate unlike the polyamory that some ulven practice my life was usually filled with fistfights and taking down disorderly people either with a few cutting words or if need be cutting with my swords one day i was told by my chieftain to escort some fur traders to the next territory while doing my duty a whiteoak female took to me i attempted to refuse her i returned to my village thinking i cast off the whiteoak female no sooner did i get through the village gate then the female shown up attempting to get inside saying i was her mate with a convincing story and all my wit disarmed by the situation my rebuttals fell on deaf ears i was cast out and told to take my new mate with me who later admitted to me that what she did she did just for fun i left my homeland in search of honor going around from village to village offering my skills with my swords to earn my keep i won many fights and battles yet my shame still got to me so i made my way north to the dirge swamp to die in the greatest battle that the great wolf would see i stopped at the village of onsallas before venturing to my last battle i visited the longfang priestess soulveig for a final blessing after a bit of conversation she revealed that i did nothing wrong mother gaia allowed the event to happen to show me a different path with much deliberation i came to terms with my past at that moment and was offered a home with the longfangs as a warrior my skill was noticed and i was trusted to guard the village and the daughters of gaia i never strayed from my duty and was there when soulveig died the one who offered me sanctuary and repentance of my past is now gone i fell into a deep depression figuring some spirits would be good to relieve the mood and tension a few mugs in three younger ulven got out of hand so i forcibly put them back into their place this got the attention of stanrick longfang after that stanrick had offered up a spot at his table for me through our conversation he stopped referring to me as the berserker or that watchwolf as many knew me and asked me if i would take the post of his bodyguard i gladly accepted now with some freedom a reason to live and a clear vision of the near future i

sister was my closest companion and though i often resented her for her weaknesses i loved her dearly our parents were deemed unfit to fight for the pack and were forced to farm the land instead my father strived to have his children bring honor back to our name when my sister and i were young he begged a great warrior to take us as apprentices to learn to fight kari and i were constantly pushed past our limits i thrived in it my sister did not it was decided that because she was so beautiful she should not need to learn to fight she would make a prospective wife for the warriors eldest son when he came of age this was how we would repay him i on the other hand continued fighting and learning new skills that winter we suffered from great hunger and kari and i went out to hunt we found ourselves running rapidly through a rough terrain in the forest we were in pursuit of a kill that would bring food to our family for several days kari begged me to slow down for her but i snapped and told her that if she couldnt keep up and pull her own weight in the family for once our deaths would be on her hands when i finally killed the beast we were hunting i asked its soul for forgiveness and turned to my sister to share my pleasure but she had let herself fall behind and was nowhere in sight i carried the burden of the creature myself angry that i had to do it alone i came across kari she had tripped over a root and cut her leg deep over some jagged rock she begged me for help to bind her wound and bring her home but in my anger i denied her i hoped she might learn to do something for herself we walked home together and i watched as she poorly bound her own wound without cleaning it or applying any salve i knew better but i let her do this it was not much longer after that i was burying her i chose to leave stormfang by my own accord and seek a new way of life i heard rumors of the location of a warrior toralf grimmsvulker who left our pack 13 years ago in search of a better life and decided to seek him out as long as i live i will never forget the pleas of my sister and the cries of my parents at her passing and i will never live this down when the great wolf turns to judge me it will find that i turned my back on my own family when i could have helped so from here on i vow to lay down my sword unless it is for the necessary defense of others i must learn

faedrun and everything else she could think of come to think of it she pestered everyone who would hold still long enough she had to find their stories you see eventually she realized that silence often yielded better results and learned to be quiet an old lorespeaker named lygari claims full credit for teaching her this lesson although by her account she figured it out on her own she still

stories of the ulven her mate veteran warrior rhodi vakr first drew her in and away from the coywolves holdings by telling her tales of his glory days with the tundra wolves and kept her with crazed

abandoning my clan and pack would make me an outcast but that didnt change my mind i needed to get out and find my own way instead of fighting for scraps in order to keep my father and i barely scraping by i had nothing but the sword and shield given to me by my grandfather and had to beat the elements and hide from the roaming mordok to survive i fed on what i could scavenge and took weapons from dead travelers and mordok to defend myself blood and battle were all i knew as i grew to a man through the years of wandering i became a mercenary of sorts as a way to make coin i also became quite proficient in the ways of the sword changing from sword and shield to using two weapons as well as a greatsword not an honest living but i had no other option at this point upon my travels as i moved southward i happened upon two strange creatures they looked like me but had no fangs and strange eyes they readied their weapons at the sight of me as i did at them i caught a familiar stench in the air mordok began to emerge from the tall grass to ambush us i did not know these two men but they fought the mordok same as i did after the skirmish i inquired about them one was a rogue of sorts carrying a bow and sword on his hip he introduced himself as leon beldwick his friend being brutish is stature was wielding sword and shield such as myself introduced himself as lux i introduced myself and shared my tale of hardship they too had similar beginnings and informed me of the colonists coming from another world from that moment on we made a pact to fight alongside

far back was painful and over time i learned to stop trying that was 11 years ago and that man became my father his name was captain ben delgreen of the vandregon rangers my father took me into a human settlement a few days ride from that place the place had a weird smell to it and everyone was unhappy to see me i didnt know it at the time but there was a war going on between the humans and my people it was because of that fact i was hated among them the kids my age were especially hard on me making daily life a pain i had more than my fair share of fights with the kids there some they started and many more i started i didnt like the names they called me fox eyes and dog boy were the most common of the names they used to get a rise out of me my father told me not to let it get to me but i didnt listen to him most of the fights i was out numbered and on more than one occasion i went home with a few bruises one kid in particular made my life hell he was the son of the mayor and a lot of the bigger kids listened to him he would use the bigger kids to fight for him my father told me not to do anything rash and i had no real reason to fight them he would always say fight smart run fast i thought about what he told me and one day i found the mayors son on his own i jumped him beat him senseless and ran before anyone saw me or knew what happened after it was done i went home with the biggest of smiles on my face my father asked me why i was more chipper than normal i told him an easy lie finished my chores and got ready for dinner about one hour after that there was a pounding at the door my father answered the door and was punched in the face by a man the unexpected blow knocked him to the ground i jumped out of my chair grabbed a knife and faced the man at the door it turned out that there was more than one three in fact they came into the house two were guards and the last one was the mayor himself the mayor told my father what i had done i looked down to where my father had fallen but he had already gotten up he looked over to me with a disappointed look on his face the mayor told us we were no longer welcomed in the town and we had to leave that night i had stayed in that town for little less than 4 months we loaded up the wagon with all we owned hooked up the oxen and then we left my father wouldnt even look at me the ride out of town was unbearable my father was the first to break the silence on the second day he asked me what was it that he told me before i left the house at first i didnt know what he meant but it came to me fight smart run fast i told him this and he asked me if i did either of them i told him yes i was smart i had found him alone i beat him senseless and had run off before anyone saw me he waited a bit after that sighed and told me how i was wrong on all accounts i didnt fight smart because i didnt think of what happens after he was right though i did find him alone and ran off before anyone saw me he was the mayors son so i was going to get caught no matter if no one saw me i had failed the first rule and it had cost us our home after that we found a plot of land in the woods to call our own it was here that my training began the training that made me the man i am today first though i needed to prove myself we got kicked out of the village at a bad time as winter was fast approaching and we needed to make shelter we had four months to build a home four very hard months we didnt have the money to hire laborers so we did the work all by ourselves we still had a strain on father son relationship and our talks amounted to hand me that tool give me a hand here and get up its time for work i was beginning to think he was regretting picking me up from the ashes of my village in the first month we managed to get the foundation done and most of the walls up by the end of the second by the end of the third month we had all but the roof done it was in the last month that i had my first encounter with mordok it was almost my first and last my father and i were still tense around each other so for the most part we kept distance from one another on that day i was getting fire wood for the upcoming weather he was putting the last of the nails in the roof as i was cutting up a log of oak into smaller peaces when i heard a snapping of a twig it was the snap that saved my life as i turned to see what made the sound my foot slipped and i fell just avoiding most of the sword swing the sword cut down the left side of my head blinding that eye with blood through my right eye i saw two of them their skin was black as night they had on bits of hide armor and thick cloaks the one that had attacked me first was smaller than the other i had heard tales of them things like their spit is poisonous they eat people and the females have magic i rolled over the log trying to see were my ax had gotten to as i did the bigger one attacked me stabbing his sword at me thankfully he missed and got his sword stuck in the oak log i was cutting i was just getting to my feet when the other threw out her hand and a gust of wind threw me fifteen feet away into a smaller tree from the ground as i was caching my breath a breeze blew by the cloak the smaller had on parted a little and show me a that this one was female not male i tried again to get to my feet and she hit me with another gust of wind throwing me hard against the small tree it knocked all the air from my body i truly believed my life to be over in that moment when i heard a cry of pain as both the female mordok and i looked over we saw my father he had sneaked up on the mordok and with an ax cut its arm clean off it was busy trying to get his sword out of the log and never saw my father coming before he could finish the wounded mordok the female took action preparing to throw a gust of wind at him noticing the movements of her hands out of the corner of his eye my father leapt away from his position his foot clipped by the spell before he landed his feet thrown wide by the force he landed hard on his side but was up again in an instant he charged her she then threw a blue orb of magic at him caching him in the chest and stopping his charge i tried to get up again to help my father but i was in a lot of pain from being slammed into that tree twice my father got to his feet and ran again at her she threw another blue orb at him missing this time and he swung his ax at her i thought for sure that he hit her but the ax bounced back harmlessly she then swung her sword at him just barely hitting him in the side he swung his ax again only this time she blocked with her sword that ax sadly was in bad shape from months of over work it also wasnt meant for battle so when the two meet the ax head broke off she then pressed her attack forcing my father back as he blocked with ax shaft as she forced him back he jumped to the side of her and rolled away from her as he did this he threw two knives at her hitting her leg and torso he then ran for my ax before he got there the wounded mordok ran at him and tackled him to the ground it was trying to bite him my father was trying to throw him off when the female came up and stabbed the sword at my father it cut deep into his upper arm things werent looking good for my father and i had no idea how he was going to get out of this it was in that moment that with a yell of rage he threw off the mordok and stood up i have never seen my father like this he was always so relaxed so to see him fighting like thisit scared me my father then picked up the ax and attacked them with a vengeance the wounded mordok never had a chance it had already lost a lot of blood and no longer had a weapon so he really couldnt fight back my father ended his life with two swings of the ax he then tackled the female to the ground and before she could do much he brutally smashed her face in with the ax when he was done he fell over and stopped moving i forced myself to stand up and slowly made my way to him fearing the worst i rolled his body over and saw that he was still breathing but only just i saw two deep cuts on his body one was on his upper arm the other was on his leg i ripped my shirt and used it as a bandage after this was done i made the trip home half carrying half dragging my father when i got him home i put him on the bed and tried to heal him as best i could my father woke up and told me to go to the chest in his room inside would be fae leaf i went to the chest and found the leaf it was small and golden in color i brought it to him and asked him what to do next he told me to chew it put it on the wound and put on new bandages he gave out a sigh of pain when i put the herb in the wound on his leg i then put the rest in the wound on his upper arm i used up all of his fae leaf he told me we were going to need more i then ran into the woods and looked for more it took me most of the night but i got what my father said would be 5 days worth we needed more or a healer the town we came from had some but we werent welcomed in he told me that he had a friend who could help i loaded him in the cart and made my way to town since it had no walls or a gate sneaking in was easy no one looked at the cart twice my father then told me where to go i found the house and almost beat the door down pounding on it as it was late at night when his friend answered the door he wasnt happy when he saw what was going on however his anger turned into worry he started to cast spells on my father asking me what happened i told him about the attack he then got to the wound on my fathers arm he and i gasped at what we saw the arm was turning black he quickly started to cast another spell when the door busted open and standing there was the last person i wanted to see blocking the firelight from the street was the mayor himself and he wasnt happy he and the guards ordered the healer to stop the healer started to ask that we be allowed to stay until he was done the mayor said no and we needed to leave now the healer then said he would go with us the mayor said that if he did he wasnt welcome back the healer was about to say something but before he could my father stood up and said dont bother were leaving the healer tried to tell him no but my father said this wasnt his problem and he left my father was better but the poison was still in him and would kill him the healer gave me a hug before i left saying stay strong as he let go i felt something in my pocket he then winked and we were shown out of the city by the guards the mayor told us if we ever came back we would be killed we left with out saying a word on the way out i checked what he put in my pocket it was a red potion my father said it was a healing potion i asked if it would heal him he said no but he had another idea for it when we got home he put a sword in the fire picked up a stick and told me to cut his arm off i couldnt believe what he was asking me he told me it was the only way put the stick in his mouth and bit down hard i then picked up the now red hot blade lined up the blow and with a deep breath i brought it down with all my strength in that one blow i cut the arm clean off my father then removed the stick from his mouth and drank the potion the blood flow stopped he the went to the house and fell onto the bed i went to him and saw that he was asleep i had many questions to ask him like where the hell he learned to fight like that but i let him sleep two days later he woke up and i asked him all the questions that i had he told me about where he was from about the rangers vandregon and the undead threat it was the undead that had forced the humans and the syndar from their homes as i listened to him i had trouble believing him the dead rising from the grave and killing everything where it not for the look of horror in his eyes as he told me of them i would have thought he was pulling my leg he then told me the first rule of the rangers fight smart run fast i asked him how many there were he told me there were five i then spent the next ten years learning all he had for me to learn every day was a day of training whether it was training with the sword first aid potions or reading up on lore my days where long and hard as my twentieth year came my father grew ill his strength was fading he had trouble breathing and his heart hurt he was never the same after the mordok attack if only the healer was able finish healing him he might have have years ahead of him but the poison robbed him of his strength and made his heart weak he was on he death bed and there was nothing i could do for him he asked me to not to train that day and just sit with him as i sat next to his bed in between coughs of blood he told me of how proud of me he was i wanted to tell him to stay here with me but we both knew his time was at an end he asked me to come closer so he could tell me the last rule i got in close and with the last of his breath he whispered the last rule to me he then died with a smile on his face its that smile that ill never forget no matter how much time passes i burnt his body and buried his ashes i did this to to mix our two cultures i went to the chest in the house where he kept his belongings inside the chest was a green tunic two short swords and leather breastplate all were from his home back when he was a ranger i put the ranger garb on and walked back to the what remand of the fire it was dying out and the wind was blowing the ashes high into the sky it brought back my first memory of him taking me out of the ashes of my village as his ashes fell up into the sky i walked away knowing that i needed to bring back the rangers and one day see his home freed of the undead in this way i would honor him i have a long way to go but i know my pathname throngar torvist played by michael hannes class warrior race ulven hair brown eyes yellow

where he came from or who he is found 23 years ago as a baby in the deepest parts of the great forest by vilkas stormfang throngar torvist was taken to live in the stormfang outpost vilkas gave him the name throngar out of respect of a childhood friend lost to mordok raids he also sensed a certain strength within the child something that would separate him from other ulven this intrigued vilkas as well as made him wary as time went on throngar seemed to grow faster than the other children his fangs grew in before the others and in greater number than normal where most ulven have around 24 fangs throngar has 8 his eyes were a piercing yellow color he would fight with the other children unprovoked and cause serious injuries this made vilkas uneasy at the childs bloodthirst at such a young age he decided throngar was more of a concern and threat than he was worth vilkas had throngar thrown into the fight pit against a wolf that had been captured with only a rusty dagger throngar survived the ordeal earning a new scar in the process the boys tenacity was impressive and drew a small crowd which did not go unnoticed by vilkas as years went on vilkas turned throngars punishment into spectacle allowing wagers to be placed on any who wanted to face throngar in combat but made sure to keep guards on hand to stop the fight before there were casualties two were always assigned to throngar to keep him from continuing to attack defeated opponents marked by countless scars throngars greatest strength was his ferocity at times he was more animal than ulven it seemed this made vilkas begin to greatly fear the boy as he grew larger stronger and tougher throngars reputation preceded him and he found fewer and fewer willing opponents in the pits something was abnormal about this ulven his brutality and savagery were like nothing seen before aside from mordok he threw himself into the fight with no concern for his wellbeing vilkas would abuse and mistreat throngar in hopes to break his will and follow vilkas orders it only made matters worse throngars rage and hate for vilkas grew more and more with each victory in the pit vilkas could see the hate in throngars gaze he was an adult now and could not be controlled by anyone rather than continue fighting in the pits growing stronger and more resentful vilkas summoned throngar for what would become his final fight three veteran warriors in full armor were sent into the pit they cut him down blow after blow striking his flesh throngar fell on his face on deaths door it seemed to be over vilkas nightmare was over two of the veterans began to walk from the corpse laid before them a shout from behind them turned their heads to see the third warrior hand grasping at a sharp rock now embedded deep in his thigh quickly their gaze was drawn towards movement behind him throngar in a full sprint for the door to the pit they gave chase but were no match for the speed of the younger and unencumbered throngar throngar bolted through the door sparing a single glance at his wouldbe executioner his gaze meets vilkas the sheer rage hate and anger searing into his mind throngar knew he was no longer welcome in pack stormfang so he let out a roar before turning and running he grabbed an axe as he ran past the local smith not giving himself time to plan nor time to feel the pain he knew was coming in his chest and arms though only skin deep he wore a great number of open slashes that looked as though he had been adorned in red war paint and the occasional town guard he passed would try to add their own mark to him as he ran past the village fence and into the woods throngar could see he was no longer being followed as his anger subsided he realized he had run further than he had travelled before and did not know where he was but he did know one thing it may not be revenge but there was blood to be shed to the north he began to walk realizing suddenly how much blood he had lost in his escape he would not die here he would not give vilkas that satisfaction through piss and vinegar he put one foot in front of the other until he heard voices maybe he was saved maybe he could find a new home here maybe he had walked into a mordok pack maybe he should just lay down for a bit he was feeling pretty tired after allplayer ryan jopp character thrand stormjarl race ulven class rogue skills archery healing two handed weapons former quartermaster of pack longfang notable traits thrand is fairly superstitious and studies the runes he often marks himself with blue face paint after praying to gaia and paying respect to the great wolf before going out on a hunt or scouting background thrand grew up on the western fringe of clan stormjarl in a small hamlet near the ocean his father a veteran warrior loyal to the local chieftan received a reward of land for many years of service thrands father borkgren stormjarl traded in his weapons and armor for farming implements and settled down life was good as borkgren and his mate gunnhilder managed their farm and raised a family although borkgren lived simply he had amassed a small wealth over his years and invested it in the farm as the years passed his farm flourished expanded and more and more farmhands were brought in to assist with the hunting and farming thrand was born into a family of 4 other siblings and had a rather normal ulven child life he helped with the farm learned all of the farmhands names and assisted his father wise in his years he respected and looked up to his father even if he was a man of few words thrands mother watched him grow much as a bear does her cubs quietly and nearby but ferociously aggressive if anything threatened her children on the western fringe of mardrun the farmlands were less likely to be struck by mordok raids so most time and energy was spent maintaining the farm borkgren had a good reputation and traded with a number of nearby farms which allowed thrand to see a lot of trade goods and get an early grip on the practice of commerce and trade because of their proximity to the coast thrand often ventured to a nearby fishing village he had a fascination with the beautifully created boats and how they worked his frequent visits made him noticeable by a ships captain and some of his crew gifts of bread and cheeses would be brought by thrand and exchanged for tours on the ship and lessons in fishing two venerable ulven took a keen interest in thrand the first being the captain halldor stormjarl and his brother raynar stormjarl halldor served as the captain of a chieftans longship and knew the call of the ocean and the winds that would carry the sails of their ship like a second language ranar stormjarl was a veteran fighter and fought alongside thrands father in numerous expeditions halldor was a mysterious and superstitious man learning long ago to trust the runes and the portents on the wind his faith in the runes proved useful over the years successfully sailing his ship and surviving some terrible storms along the way thrand eagerly learned to open his eyes to these portents and try to learn from them halldor used to tell thrand that our life is one part destiny and one part free will halldor would explain that it is like hunting a hunter may flush a bird from a thicket and know that it is about to fly the precise moment is not known but that it will happen is assured when the bird flushes and soars into the sky the hunter must anticipate the direction speed and distance of the bird in order to strike it with an arrow the portents if read correctly may tell us of the hidden bird and the flush perhaps even the direction of the bird in flight but it is the hunters choice to act on it or not thrand in his early years would be confused by statements like this and it just added to the ominous presence of the longships captain halldor also had extensive knowledge on the healing arts using supplies to stave off sickness of his crew and in helping injured warriors rescued from battle and mordok raids raynar was the more grounded of the two brothers he was the leader of the elite warriors that would be assigned to chieftans longship raynar trusted his brother halldor and his men always landed safely and respected the portents even if he did not practice them thrand was a farmer and a hunter but all ulven learn how to fight thrand was able to learn from a veteran like raynar in the basics of handling a sword axe and sax daggers being a quick learner thrand took his teaching seriously and as he grew older he wondered why his father never taught him how to fight especially since borkgren was just as skilled and veteran as raynar the village was home to numerous families and with borkgrens farm settlement getting larger thrand came into contact with a number of people and friends a young ulven girl fritha lived in the village and thrand knew of her they talked and had several friends but they didnt know each other very well twelve years ago everything changed when the colonists arrived war broke out between ulven and outsider and a call was raised to assist in the fight clan stormjarl sent healers and daughters to help not entirely wanting to commit to the fight thrand and a number of his fellow villagers including fritha volunteered to help and moved east to the front lines of the fighting they worked alongside one another patching up wounded gathering supplies and scouting out the woodlands it was at this time that thrand began to take a genuine interest in fritha and he made his intent known they acknowledged one another but were too busy helping with the wounded and supplies of the war the truce was finally written and the fighting stopped thrand and fritha returned to their village and continued their lives they became close over the year as friends and then eventually as mates but thrands duty to the farm and frithas duty to the daughters of gaia in the area kept them very busy fritha taught thrand more about the healing arts and thrand in return taught fritha how to hunt shoot bow and how to navigate the woods they made it a bit of a game learning from each other thrand received a summons to his fathers longhouse at the farm his father coldly and calmly told him that thrand had been selected as part of clan stormjarls honorbound pledge to send warriors to pack longfang near the dirge swamp he was to leave immediately the next morning with a caravan of supplies that would be traveling northeast thrands current life was over and he hated the pledge and he argued with his father that he would stand idly by and watch his son be sent off his father respected the honor of pack longfang and told thrand to do the same furious thrand packed his belongings and went to say goodbye to halldor raynar and fritha halldor presented thrand with a gift of rune dice so that he may continue to read the portents he also reminded thrand that he was now leaving to serve a pack whose sole leader is the most powerful runeseer on mardrun he would be able to study runes closer than any ulven before raynar sent thrand off with a final sparring lesson and then gifted him with a pineed wood axe one that had been used by raynar over the years in his expeditions it was a fine weapon and thrand had trained with it many times over the years both of the brothers bid thrand farewell and promised that they would meet again someday fritha on the other hand had a different reaction instead of being sad with thrands departure she packed up her belongings and met thrand the next morning refusing to let him leave without her she said that she had chosen to leave with him to study under the witches of the onsallas village but thrand knew that she left mainly because of him they would venture out into this new part of their lives together as friends and as mates thrand arrived at the outpost and immediately took to being a longfang hunter skilled at archery and navigating the woods thrands place among them was assured quickly after several years of hunting mordok in the swamp and of sending messages and gathering supplies thrand was promoted to quartermaster of the outpost he is now in charge of some of the training resource management and maintenance of the outpost he and fritha are still mates and they regularly will gather their hunting supplies and bows and go off into the swamp to hunt and track mordok this role is well suited to him and he has done well as the outposts quartermaster but he dearly misses his home in stormjarl territory he knows that his father will be very old by now and he has not heard anything from halldor or raynar he misses that simple life in the farms woods and coastline of clan stormjarl many times thrand will sit and watch the horizon lost in his thoughts and casting his rune dice reading the portents that are revealed to himi am thalia mate of magnus forgebreaker i was born into clan goldenfield in 231 and married off to clan ironmound i grew up learning to grow everything and bring life to the land caring for all that grew when i was twentytwo i met magnus forgebreaker and joined my life to his my father died so that we could meet so even finding out that he was from another clan couldnt prevent me from becoming his mate we traveled throughout his clans lands looking for a place that we could call home after three young ones and many homes we have decided to settle i hope to bring life to this place and feed its people i hope to see it thrive through my skill with the land and magnus protection i hope to build a safe place for my young to grow in peacesteiner ulf played by james bergles character name steiner ulf gender male class warrior mineralist bard age unknown but around 50 race ulven hair brown too bald eyes green occupation i steiner ulf am a semiretired warrior throughout my travels with clan stormjarl i have participated in many battles and am now seeing the effects of living a long and violent life with the numerous lands i have traveled i took notice of the different minerals and woods present by sampling and testing i have determined their constructive value i have developed unique methods of extracting minerals from the crust of the land i have found out through trial and error that many of the minerals react well with others during the smelting and shaping processes making for a higher quality product as i slowly move out of being a fullfledged warrior i wish to teach minerals and their uses to the ulven and their allies the stronger the metal and woods we can infuse into our armor and defenses the weaker it will make our enemies graytir of clan stormjarl is a staunch supporter of my work he has supported my efforts to find stronger minerals to make our armor more impenetrable his riches grow with every land i visit i find it an honor to bring back new minerals to present to him and describe what they can do it is the least i can do with what he has done for me known skills as stated previously i have been an ulven warrior for many years during that time i have developed a trade i call mineralist the skill of mineralist is one who has great knowledge of all natural items that come from the folds of gaias ground a mineralist knows their uses and what existing elements they can be fused with to cause greater strength and durability to metal and wood objects a second skill i have is bard simple musician that can play the lute bodhran and mandolin birthplace the earliest memory i have is being a nomadic traveler amongst the seas the family i had spent their years traveling many islands but always would return to the village chieftain every 5 years to share knowledge and gifts they had gathered appearance seeing i work in the ground i choose to dress brown to black in normal ulven clothing in times of battle i don armor of steel and leather i have seen many fighters fall from a ship only to have their armor drag them down to the dark depths of the sea what i wear allows me to stay buoyant for a short time long enough to rid myself of extra weight that would pull me down during mass battle i will wear a blood red tunic if i am wounded it cannot be noticed by the enemy notable traits my most notable trait is nothing i blend into the village as a normal person and this is how i want it for now after long journeys i may come back with a beard if i am spending longer times in the village i may shave it off i have found some minerals to cause sparks and flames which does not go well with beards one item unique to my skill is the wicker pack some minerals i have found react with the moisture in leather so i use caution and carry all in a wicker pack another notable trait is teaching music to anyone who asks it is a gift that will never end as they teach it to the next person and so on and so on relationships since my life has been endless travel i have started no relationships it would serve me no purpose to have a family follow me and i would die on a foreign soil if this were to happen i would be an unsettled soul once i open my business for trade on the new island i will look for help to assist in the shop this person would learn the trade and how reactions of minerals are more reliable than magic until this person is trained i would hope to not allow others into the field mineralist is not a skill one hands out like free ale people who want to dig carry or cut can always be used rumors i have heard rumors that i practice in the dark arts all this is utter nonsense it is only people afraid of the unknown because i can produce stronger steel than most smiths or bring forth gems from raw stones makes me different because i can melt colored glass onto steel to form patterns of honor leaves them thinking magic must be involved their ignorance of not understanding our natural soil elements only makes me wanting to show them more bio  background history being a semi reclusive ulven opens me up for storytelling my parents were washed overboard during a strong storm at sea i was able to hold onto some flotsam and washed ashore months from our home village i found it easier to join a new village by demonstrating my skills to chieftain graytir stormjarl this showed i had use and was not just an unlucky traveler i was a traveler who could make unique items from minerals and metal at one point i instructed a smithy on how to smelt minerals into metal for greater shield boss strength when the chieftain smashed his war axe into the shield he saw that though the mighty blow left a hefty dent it did not crack as it should have at this point i became a valuable commodity and was allowed into clan stormjarl the chieftain requested i travel with his army to find more minerals and unique woods on the fire isle at the stormborn settlement i wish to open the first steiner ulf mineralist shop the fire isle has not been explored for minerals i am looking forward to the new terrain of this island and what it will give me i feel my first task will be to support the troops as they venture into the dirge swamp from what i have seen from the edges of the swamp i may find some iron based minerals that resistrust the few mordok i have seen possessed weapons and armor that resisted rust i feel they must have found a resource that is natural to the swamp that is malleable into fightable iron one of the first people i must befriend in the stormborn settlement is the smithy with his or her knowledge of metals and my introduction of new elements we can build armor that will resist cleaves and cause arrows to deflect i wonder if that is a good idea because the arrow may hit the person next to its target i have a feeling i may find the missing element in the dirge swamp if not i will keep lookingsalguod nightclaw natanieal male 24 ulven brown hair greenblue eyes occupation traveling warrior known skills fighting birthplace icewolf

was born 18 years ago in a village on the edge of the great forest within the borders of shattered spear territory in the dead of winter she was comfortable with her family and her life in pack silver creek and spent most of her childhood trying to learn whatever she could from the people there her warrior mother ingrid and blacksmith father jorah devoted themselves to teaching her everything they knew her father taught her everything he knows about taking care of weapons and armor while her mother taught her all she knew about fighting and preserving your honor both her parents were quiet people they mostly kept to themselves outside of the most basic social contact they always wear darker colors and runa takes after them in both aspects though her packmates think she is a slight bit more social than they ever were as much as her father tried he was never able to teach her anything about being patient she felt that being patient was a waste of her time and it angers her some say her impatience comes across as rude expect dagger to thunk in the door behind you if you want to make her wait though even with her lack of patience she was always a quiet one often only speaking to a person once she grew to trust them she was often caught staring at new people but never showed any shame in it she never trusted easily though once you get to know her she might have a quick witted comment for you having heard many stories of unnecessary killings of perfectly capable ulven it confused her why kill those who are able to fight she found that she hopes to not ever have to harm another ulven she would much rather use her skills against mordok and the threat they pose she does however see the purpose and necessity of sometimes having to fight another ulven when her mother died in a battle she was devastated not that anyone besides her father saw any of her grief after ingrid died she listened to her father talk about her mothers heroic deeds with focus most of the stories he was telling her mother had never told her that day runa realized she still had much to learn now that her mother was gone and unable to continue teaching her she realized it was time to move on in search of greater training she traveled for half a year learning the importance of the currency the colonists brought with them and gaining a sort of sympathy and respect for them but mostly a lot of confusion of their traditions and rituals having never been taught how to read when she was young she found traveling on her own was quite difficult and often felt regret leaving her pack even so she remembers how necessary it was for her to leave and is still in search of something more substantial for her and how she wants to liveplayed by allen zautke name rogar shadowfang race

shodowfang and my loyalty is to my birth pack pack shadowfang was a strong pack known for its skills in tracking and their knowledge of stealth though we didnt have the mightiest warriors a trained shadowfang warrior could almost disappear in to any environment and attack his enemys weakness with deadly precision  a true shadowfang warrior would pride himself on his ability to defeat an enemy before his enemy knew he was there killing was not our only skill as we had many fine craftsmen and our hunters and farmers kept us fed we thrived in the land gaia had given us and i was born into this life it seems though that this prosperity was not meant to last our elders tell of a time when the mordok gathered in numbers we had never seen this raid cut a path of destruction across the our land the ulven packs banded together and brought down this threat but the damage had already been done pack shadowfang village was caught in the path of that horde and over night more then half of our pack was slaughtered with our numbers decimated and little hope of rebuilding our nearest neighbors pack graytide took us in in the graytide village our elders tried to keep what was left of our pack together and to hold on to our culture and way of life like many others of my pack my parents were killed trying to defend our home growing up an orphan in the graytide village my life was not easy though we were taken in by our graytide brethren we were never truly accepted and were seen as not much more then squatters the graytide warriors saw our way of combat as cowardly and backhanded  they said if we were strong warriors we wouldnt need to sneak about i was raised mostly by the elders of my pack i learned all i could of our old ways and in time i grew to be a strong and skilled warrior then came the day i will never forget the day that started me down the path i am on to this day i was asked to join a hunting party and tasked with tracking some mordok near the boarder of graytide land while on the trail of the mordok we came across a human caravan the hunt leader a vile ulven known as davor ordered an attack on the humans i protested saying this was not our mission and the humans were no danger davor insisted in the attack telling the other hunters that the humans were trespassing on graytide land and the intruders had to be made an example of to the others i did what i could to talk davor and the others out of the attack but the bloodlust and hatred of the humans in graytide eyes was hard to over come davor ordered me to attack or i would be treated no differently then the enemy he then ordered us to fan out and move in to striking range i know i had to stop this i would not stand ideally by as innocent lives were in danger as we got into position i snuck ahead of the others and made my way towered the caravan i was with in a stones throw away when i sprang my attack not on the humans but on my graytide brothers i broke cover and shouted to the humans in the caravan that they were under attack and to flee i then turned my attention to the graytides now charging towards me i had to slow them down or they would over run me and i had to give the humans time to escape i didnt have a bow but i did have my daggers and i threw one at the nearest graytide hitting him in the shoulder as he staggered from the hit he tripped and fell in the underbrush as another charged me i sunk a dagger into his thigh as he fell to the ground i had just enough time to parry a sword attack from my left it was davor and as he advanced for another attack he yelled youll pay for your betrayal rogar and you will pay for your bloodlust you and all the rest of clan grimward your hatred will only bring suffering to the ulven nation you are no longer part of that nation you dare strike your fellow ulven brothers to protect those filthy outsiders as davor spoke two more ulven joined the fight and surrounded me i will not let innocent lives suffer for your pleasure davor now it is you rogar that will suffer get him davor and the other two graytide rushed me i did what i could fighting three on one but they eventually overpowered and disarmed me the last thing i remember from the fight was sharp pain and everything going black when i awoke i found my hands bond and two graytide were dragging me to my feet they toke me over to where davor was standing and threw me at his feet its time for you to pay for your betrayal do your worst davor you will get no pleasure from me davor was known to make his victims suffer before death and i would not give him the satisfaction of knowing my pain my former graytide brothers took their turns with fist and boot but i would not cry out then davor took matters in is own hands he grabbed a dagger and drove it into my leg as he twisted it in my flesh he carefully studied my face as i grimaced from the pain he spoke your stronger then you look rogar if your going to kill me get it over with i tire of your games a worthless traitor like yourself does not deserve a death from a true warrior no i will leave you here broken and let the scavengers pick at your bones davor yanked the dagger from my leg and called over two of the other graytide who restrained me but first i think we should carry out an old traditions an eye for an eye with that davor set to work carving out my right eye infecting the most amount of pain he could though i had taking their punishment so far the pain of the endeavor was too much for me to bear and before i passed out from my torment im sure that even the great wolf heard my screams that night when i came to night had fallen and dark clouds fill the sky davor and the other graytide were gone they had taken my weapons and equipment but had failed to find the blade hidden in my boot i was weak from blood lose but i found the strength to free myself from my bonds i then set to work assessing and bandaging my wounds my right eye was gone cut completely from my skull and the wound in my leg was very deep with what cloth i could spare from my clothes i did my best to treat my injures i had to get out of this area case some scavengers actually did find me i was tracking mordoks after all and i would not be able to fend off an attack in my state but i was tired and my senses were dulled and soon became disoriented i blindly stumbled though the night i didnt know which way was which or in what direction i should be traveling if my ancestors could see my now a shadowfang lost in the wood i thought as i leaned on a tree to collect my self i hadnt been walking long and all ready i was exhausted  i could feel the strength in my body leaving me a sense of dread crept up my spine could this be my end no you will not give up here you cant let those graytide get away with this i told myself and was right i had to survive i gathered what strength i had and soldered on but as a toke my first step i found no strength in my body and fell to the ground i tried to get to my feet but my body my muscles would not listen to me and i collapsed on to my back as i gazed up at the gray sky my vision darkened as my eye slowly closed i suddenly felt a presents and a cool breeze on my face that shock me back to reality as my eye opened i could see the clouds in the sky part and the sky filled with stars and the brightest moon ive ever seen to this day shone down on me luna i said out loud my people had always revered the moon and now as her gaze fell upon me i felt a surge of strength pulling me to my feet with the light of luna guiding me and the stars to follow i managed to regained my bearing and started heading south out of graytide lands i came across a small stream there i drank and washed the blood from my face i then cleaned and redressed my wounds i followed an old game trail for a time that lead me to a path traders and travelers must have used i made my way down this path it was well worn and easy to follow as i came over a ridged over looking a small valley i noticed the smoke of a settlement just over the horizon but i was weary from travel i needed to rest and regain my strength i would make for the settlement tomorrow i fond a comfy spot next to a large tree where the underbrush covered my presents from anyone walking down the trail before i closed my eye and drifted to sleep a said a small prayer to luna and swore a vow that as long as i had strength in my body i would protect the people of this land from anyone who would bring them harm when i awoke the next day the sun was already high in the sky i gathered my self and made my way to the settlement id seen the night before i left the trail and toke a more direct route as i got with in eye sight of the settlement it looked to be a human trade out post i also came across sets of tracks i knew far too well there were graytide in the area i quickened my pace toward the settlement if the graytide were this close they must be planning an attack as i entered the building i warned the people inside of the graytide in the area most of the people went out to meet them two stayed behind and treated my wounds after the battle many of the fighters came back injured a couple of them severe i knew we wouldnt be able to survive another attack and told the others to gather any supplies they could carry and leave the area before we could get organized the graytide burst in the back door and set fire to the building i grabbed the nearest weapons and tried to give people time to get out out side on the trails they pursued us and once again i found myself fighting my former graytide brothers for the sake of strangers eventually our enemy broke off their pursuit and we were able to catch our breath the survivors and myself made our way towards nightriver territory it was this time that i first meet venator one of the ulven from the settlement he complemented me on my fighting skill and my willingness to protect the weak he then told me of vandregon and asked me to travel with him to new hope where i could meet a man named william and join the cause i now fight for something greater then myself i will fulfill my sworn vow and

it when she came of age she did so believing her path would be that of the hunter while she could potentially have excelled on this path her true calling revealed itself while traveling with her mother when in moonfury territory not only did she meet the male who would come to be her mate and follow her home to her pack but she found her true calling as a healer reyna waited on her return to longfang then began the slow and arduous process of studying under the priestess her greataunt solveig the study took years and though fareth moonfury had followed her and was seeking acceptance into

the fire was slowly revived the pink and golden hues of the rising sun began to creep across the autumn landscape warming the blue shadows of night raskolf rose to his feet to salute the dawn patrol as they passed he remained standing after they were gone squinting in the early light it was nearing the anniversary of the battle that changed their lives anjan ravensmark used to like sunrises too they were both warriors once upon a time raskolf remembered well the last sunrise that anjan ever saw it was bloody and red the clouds were yellow raskolf was the inspecting packleader that day and he had selected the route they were to take that morning it was his fault that they were ambushed he should have taken the patrol back to the village when the tracks were discovered but he decided to do some further scouting first breka norri and hranbjorn were killed in the initial ambush grolf lost both his legs anjan received a severe head injury the entire patrol would have been lost were it not for her she fought like a rabid animal striking so hard that she broke her weapon on an opponent she killed six more with just the hilt and her fists anjan headbutted the mordok chieftain so hard that her helmet became embedded in his face and slipped off of her head she suffered many wounds but only went down after getting a mace buried in her skull the patrol managed to fend off the attackers just long enough for the village to respond to their call for help raskolf smoked his pipe and watched the last member of the patrol disappear into the trees raskolf didnt lead patrols anymore his job was to guard the priestess he followed her by day and slept with her at night she was the mother of his daughter the job he had been given was the most honorable position a warrior could hope for but it was also his penance he loved her but he couldnt forgive himself for what had happened to her it had been 9 years she permanently lost her sight when she took that mace to the head and in the fevered nightmares of her recovery the goddess spoke to her anjan had become a priestess and raskolf was her warder raskolf was born to an ulven warrior and a poor turnip farmer from the white howler pack from a young age his mother taught him the use of the sword and his father taught him the secrets of agriculture he tried real hard not to learn anything from his father after joining the warrior caste at a young age and quickly rising through the ranks he found himself commanding troops in a winter campaign against the mordok it was at this point that he really started to take an interest in turnip farming raskolf had a natural talent for leading troops he was well liked by his fellow warriors and people looked up to him his unit was very successful on their campaigns against the mordok and developed a reputation among both friend and foe after years together on the battlefield the tundra wolves were an elite unit comprised of veteran warriors from all across the ulven nation raskolf had a successful career as a soldier until a large patrol under his command was nearly wiped out in an ambush the handpicked patrol was comprised of raskolfs best friends and most trusted comrades they found sign that indicated a very large number of mordok in the area raskolf should have turned his patrol around and sent runners ahead to warn the village but he wanted to get more information for his report first he was overconfident and felt that his troops could handle a numerically superior foe in the event that they made contact refusing the advice of his most trusted colleagues he led them right into an ambush the mordok attack was overwhelming most of his troops died in the first minute when the charge came the tundra wolves were outnumbered ten to one the soldiers who were killed were all elite veterans including some high ranking officials raskolf lost his command over the incident many of the warriors killed in the ambush were not only veterans but heroes or the sons and daughters of prominent ulven leaders raskolf lost everything he had paying the blood debts to their families when he had run out of wealth and possessions he found himself indentured to one of the survivors who had been maimed in the attack he is now the warder of anjan ravensmark an ulven high priestess there are some who say he doesnt deserve the position as it is normally one of honor recently he has been entrusted with the title of voice of the watchwolves and has been sent to the colonies to serve as the ambassador of the watchwolf clan he was integral in the drafting of the watchwolf resolution which demanded that the colonists pay certain respects to the ulven lands and the ulven gods if they were to live there despite the initial positive response of the human and syndar settlers to comply with the resolution and begin burning rather than burying their dead clan grimward have declared war on the colonists and the watchwolves have been dragged into the civil war

yoreden longfang as a pup he wanted anything but to be stanricks little brother whatever stanrick was training to do ranmir would make sure he was doing something else while stanrick was training to be a hunter ranmir started sneaking around climbing trees one morning while stanrick was sparring with his hunter trainer ranmir decided to pick up stanricks bow and start shooting he truly was a natural and within a week was shooting just as well as stanrick ranmir continued to train with the bow while his brother began to focus on his swordsmanship as a longfang ranmir quickly became familiar with the mordok due to the proximity of his home to the dirge swamp after completing his hunter training ranmir even led a few scouting packs a short way into the swamp to better keep tabs on the movement of the ulvens eternal foe at 18 he was tracked down by a band of mordok while staying overnight in the swamp and nearly died but for chancing upon another hunting group to even the odds when ranmir was 21 a strange vessel came to the territories bringing other tribes of different races for a year ranmir fought with his brethren to stop the invasion after which our leaders discovered they could be reasoned with with a truce newly formed ranmir set off alone into the swamp if these outsiders could come to a truce with the ulven surely the mordok could as well he journeyed into the dirge swamp with only his own weapons and wits to protect him he knew he could not return to onsallas until he had succeeded in the task laid before him for the first few months he tracked the movements of the mordok trying not to be seen a few times he was spotted but his training as a hunter allowed him to evade combat and escape after ranmir knew their movement patterns the encounters became fewer and fewer he attempted to make peace with the mordok by leaving fresh game in their paths to no avail he tried unarmed attempts and negotiation but was met with hostility after a season of failure he began to forget his original mission turning instead to focus purely on his own survival when his supplies ran low he would silently make his way to the camps of small packs of mordok taking as much food as he could carry before retreating into the night before the mordok could be roused the longer he stayed in the swamp however the more desperate for supplies he became occasionally not even waiting until nightfall to steal from the mordok as he would run from his targets ranmir eventually picked up on a single word they would shriek as soon as he was discovered brf for years he remained in the dirge swamp with no contact save for with the mordok forgetting all he once was ranmir was gone left now was only brf now twelve years after entering the swamp he spotted a band of warriors hunters and clerics dotted with a familiar face or two who had ventured into the dirge swamp curious but cautious he followed their movements along their journey until they left the

others but we were blessed by gaia with peace and less mordok than other clans had to deal with but it all changed the day grimward invaded our clan leader had chosen neutrality in the war but to clan grimward we were as good as enemies they invaded attacked and killed our people they pushed us all the way to the sea that was the day that really defined me the day my father left us to join the great wolf my family had reached one of the last villages left standing refuges had poured in from the rest of our lands grimward was on the warpath my dad and i were keeping my brother safe my mother was a strong warrior she was in the rear with a few other warriors keeping us safe in case of ambush my father said it would be a few hours until we reached the village i was scared that we wouldnt make it grimward had been fallowing us closely and my mother said that her and the warriors had only barely been able to repel the last attack i remember what happened next the best we had just passed a burned down farm and the screams started they must have sent a group to cut us off in the front because ten grimward warriors charged out of the woods and began to attack us i pressed forward to engage an enemy in front of me he swung his ax at me and i blocked it with my sword we exchanged blows for a few moments then my father joined me by my side and together we felled the warrior our group started running for our lives my father and i took my brother and started to run we could hear people screaming around us and the sounds of fighting all over but we kept running until our legs could take us no farther we found a good hiding place for the night my brother cried until he fell asleep and my father and i took shifts staying up to keep watch we all wondered about my mother and how she was doing i woke to movement there were voices coming closer my father told us to stay calm we watched from our hiding hole two warriors from grimward where searching for survivors they passed by without finding us and we stayed hidden for a while but soon we started to move onto the village hopefully mother would be there we walked for a bit once we found the road we knew that the village would be just a little further and we would be safe we started to see the smoke from the town just a little bit ahead and our hopes started to rise but soon fell just as quickly they had come out of nowhere three arrows flew through the sky they each hit their target and my father fell before my eyes in an instant i was unable to help or even move i just watched him hit the ground and then they moved on us four warriors three archers and one larger ulven with a two handed ax he struck me before i could move the pain was more then i could take i fell to the ground and he moved toward my brother i tried to stop him and he kicked me in the chest from my back i saw in horror my little brother try to plea for his life he brought his ax up to finish my brother and started to bring it down the world froze time stopped i was losing my family right before my eyes apparently my mother thought so to because she came in hot she blocked the ax with her spear and drove a dagger through his chest he staggered back in pain she swung her spear around and left a gash on his chest and then plunged it into his left leg and he fell two of the archers let loose some arrows in her direction but my mother was warrior through and through she dodged leaving the spear in the grimward warriors leg she moved on to the three left and she summoned a ball of gaias wrath and threw it into the chest of one of the archers he fell instantly and the others to began to flee having seen how quickly she had dismantled two of them she turned to us and after that it all starts to blur together burning my dads body my mother healing us and getting to the village i swore to myself that day that never again would i lose any of my family to anything i would gather the strength i needed to stand at the front and protect my family i dont know why but my mother put us on a ship to crows landing when we got to the harbor there was a man waiting at the dock he had a green hood and he welcomed us as we got off the ship he talked to my mother in private and she told us that the man knew our dad and that he had given us a place to stay in town many of the houses were empty since the winter was bad and many here didnt make it we were thankful for the help and given a place to stay i thanked the man he said its what we do to help those in need i soon joined up with the rangers i found out the man

back to the sea i didnt like the genocidal methods they were using so i spoke up and was banished so now i find myself on the side of the humans and syndar but i still dont like them the reason i chose speak up against the pack was because one day we went to look for supplies found a caravan of humans and syndar my pack slaughtered everyone even noncombatants and burned the wagons i witnessed a pack member yeliw graytide take his sword and cut a human childs head off the child must have been only 10 and had already lost his parents even though this child picked up a sword he didnt look like a threat at all after witnessing the childs murder at the hands of a pack member i decided enough was enough that night around the packs campfire i stood up and spoke against the packs way of dealing with the outsider colonist the others did not agree with my point of view they gave me my sword and the scar across my eye and told me to not return or they would take my life i took my sword

history when i was ten i was introduced to divine magic i was eager to learn i dont have much of a family as the majority of them have been killed at some point or another which leaves me to be alone in my practices quite often i learn fast and protect the people i consider to be family over all if you get in my way i will end your life with no remorse i follow orders and do as my clan orders when i am not working for my clan i am practicing and learning new skills to become stronger or i am at the tavern with my friends i do not fear hurting people by what i say or do i will not control myself to appease the liking of others protect the clan by all means necessary even if it offers your life this is what i go by i lost my family to the treacherous whores known as axehound they are the only clan that causes me to become so enraged that i want to tear them to shreds axehound killed my mother and father when i was a young pup my parents were out patrolling when the monsters attacked taking my parents and a few other lives from the clan with them i was told that they fought hard but axehound has no dignity and took their lives when they were distracted by battle on that day a whole new war had started and i made a promise to avenge my parents and my clan i was already learning divine magic before this travesty happened it was the push i needed to get stronger i wish to kill every one of those bastards i am not particularly fond of humans either when they came i was learning how to use divine magic and i seem to excel more at it than arcane they tried to make me a daughter of gaia but i wished to put all of my concentration at getting stronger with divine magic maybe one day ill try again to learn the ways of the priestesses but for now i wish to master the divine arts years later i was outside going to the tavern when four warpacks or units as the other races call them appeared in our village three of which were from the rangers and one of which was from the nomads they were strange looking these rangers but the thought of protecting the clan as they had gave them a sort of awe that drew me to them these people protected my clan when we in turn had tried to destroy them months ago there was no reason we had wished them dead and in turn when we ourselves were dying they came to our aid the strength they projected had me wishing to join them and i am honor bound to them for protecting my clan the thought of being one of them weighed heavily on my mind i left the tavern and approached them i was looking for the head of the war pack which they call officers i walked up to this officer and told him of my desire to join their pack he was taken aback and surprised by my wish he told me that i was better off talking to the one known as tobias at crows landing tobias is the commander of the rangers and therefore the leader of their clan i thanked the officer and left to my home to pack some supplies i was driven and determined to find this leader to convince him to let me join his clan i made my way to crows landing and found this tobias it was a little unsettling at first as there were so many people he seemed to be very important or maybe just busy i got a sense of calm when i noticed that he too was an ulven the meeting of my inquiry was short as he was busy with various reports he was however happy to have a new recruit i have no understanding of half of what he said it was all utterly confusing something about with enough work i could work my way up to a seeker i am now what is known as a sister of the rangers whatever that might be but i have a new home and a new clan to protect i hope that by what i am doing will bring honor to both me and my clan for they will always be in my thoughtscharacter bio mar bloodfang

traits missing his right eye walks with a noticeable limp right arm is permanently affixed to a sling elaborate facial tattoos white beard and mustache tends to think for a moment before speaking bio ask lygari about his past and youll hear a different story each time this old ulven has been wandering madrun for the majority of his life collecting the stories and songs of his people and preserving the names of great heroes he considers it his duty to act as chronicler to the ulven people preserving the stories of the great heroes of his people almost to the point of fanaticism beyond that of a normal lorespeaker the only consistent story told by lygari comes at the end of each night a village or pack hosts him when all the other stories are exhausted pointing to the eye patch which covers his right eye he tells the story of his first patrol around his childhood village at the age of 17    or 14    or 22 though the name of the village and its location may change every time the story advances along the same lines the patrol members spotted a lone mordok poorlyconcealed in what was clearly meant to be an ambush quietly laughing at the creatures ineptitude lygari ran straight towards it eager for his first opportunity to prove himself the tripwire caught him around the ankle and the thrown knife caught him in the eye he lost consciousness immediately and the mordok fled melting away in the forest faster than the other patrol members could follow his companions carried him back to the village and called for a healer who managed to remove the knife but noticed a sickly substance on the blade  poison they had no means to heal the poison and the nearest daughter of gaia was three days travel away he languished in unconsciousness while she was fetched on the seventh day just as the daughter arrived he awoke at this point the story diverges once again sometimes he claims that he was told by the daughter of gaia that he had been given a greater purpose in his life to sing the deeds of others other times he claims to have met the great wolf who told him that the only way his name would be remembered would be if he sung the tales of a thousand brave heroes of the ulven people if every story he has told is to believed in that week of unconsciousness he met every single ulven legend and was charged by them to collect these stories seeing this as a sign he immediately sought out a senior lorespeaker in order to apprentice himself it was three or four or eight or nine depending on how much hes had to drink and when hes telling the story years before he was finally accepted into the brotherhood of the lorespeakers forever giving up his name he chose the old ulven lygari for a name partially out of mischief at his own efforts to blur his own past and partially for his tendency to change stories in the telling as he himself says the art of telling a story is exaggeration while he is clearly somewhat odd amongst the lorespeakers he has proven to know the history of these people as well as any other ulven historian and can recite the correct versions of stories if pressed despite this he finds the presence of the colonists irksome they have little respect for the older storytelling traditions of the ulven outside of a few scattered scholars they challenge the integrity and continuity of ulven culture and separate his people from the spirit of the great wolf bringing them to empty causes at best hes a somewhat gruff distrustful storyteller to nonulven at worst he chooses stories that make the colonists look foolish adding vain syndar and impractical humans to any story he feels can hold it the symbol of this problem is the civil war with the graytide this is something he is certain that they learned from the colonists however he is torn between the stances of the warring factions the graytides position of expelling the colonists appeals to his distrust of this new culture but the longfangs have always steered themselves well and at what cost must they be expelled still he is getting old its been a great number of years since he gave up his name and he can feel the jaws of the great wolf growing closer one of his arms is forever bound in a sling and he walks with enough of a limp to need protection despite the lorespeakers pledge to always move on when a story is known he thinks hes found the story that will find him his eventual death the time has come for him to train an apprentice as well so that the lore of the ulven people continues unbroken its hard to tell whats truth and whats a lie especially when it comes from an ulven whose willingly called himself a liar on the other hand many villages are willing to overlook this in favor of his knowledge of the great heroes and legends of old if a hero needs to be remembered lygari will be there relationships taught ysla stormhand a number of stories in her youth currently under the hospitality of the watchwolves in northern mardrun

ulven hair brown eyes blue occupation servant birthplace unsure appearance wears red and grey coat notable traits submissive and overly polite luka was born as a member of clan grimward but he doesnt remember where his place of birth is at age 6 luka was captured and raised as a servant by humans little more than a slave this was in a time of turmoil between the humans and the ulven so it wasnt uncommon for villages to be sacked and people to go missing from there luka was stripped of his birth name and given the name he now uses this was to demoralize and emotionally break those who were captured then the beating began luka was beaten and forced to become compliant and obedient luka was then kept in a human camp as a worker and servant this only lasted a couple years before he was moved then moved again and again and again from camp to camp as more humans arrived once they became more established it was decided that to keep luka around without some pretext would be suspicious to the higher human authorities in the area therefore luka was wrongly charged with attempting to steal a valuable sword from a human officer he was then offered a choice death or to continue his servitude luka chose the latter fourteen years passed since his initial capture and life got pretty good luka accepted life and learned to enjoy his situation a month ago luka was traveling with his latest master a small time merchant they were suddenly jumped by bandits and his master was hurt but out of nowhere a man showed up and rescued them from the bandits he wore red and black and called himself eli not having much to pay the rescuer the merchant offered lukas services as payment and the deal was struck shortly after that eli explained that he had no wish to oppress a person in the way that luka had been and he freed luka from his service this confused luka as he could not comprehend a free lifestyle and he insisted that he would stay with eli and work for him after a long debate a deal was made between the two in exchange for loyalty and service to elis faction the crimson shades luka would receive room and board this pleased luka and in no time he settled right back into his common role as a servant but this time it was different these people didnt see him as a mongrel criminal but rather an actual person he took an exceptional liking to eli and tends to still refer to him as master much to elis discontent luka now also cares for the needs of the rest of the faction referring to most of them as sir or madam this is now his life and he couldnt be

moving from place to place however the family recently joined the silverhowl pack and the watchwolves of luna the silverhowls position at the forefront of human syndar  ulven relations on mardrun made them an excellent choice for cliste and his family if he can accomplish his goal to establish trade  commerce between the 3 people some say he will become a new breed of ulven hero clistes position

mordok he was fighting jorvik looked on with agony as an ugly blade appeared in the center of the ulvens chest and a red stream began to flow from his linen shirt the ancient blade that the old ulven had so masterly wielded sank into the snow in front of jorvik rage filled his heart as the world became a red haze jorvik raised the rusted blade from the snow and advanced towards the blackskinned

ulven hair brown eyes blue occupation healer dear journal i have recently become the healer at the outpost i have taken over for thrand since he left its been rough but nothing i cant handle ive come to know the people here quite well stanrick our chieftain isnt as cold and ruthless as the stories led me to believe he is loud though there are others here mostly ulven but we also get humans and syndar they are all right but some dont respect our way of doing things i myself find it annoying and disrespectful but fighting amongst ourselves is what started this stupid war living at the outpost isnt too terribly bad but as a healer im always busy due to the swamp well thats all i have time to say for now jarta longfang was born in the longfang village he wasnt particularly big for his age and wasnt good at fighting he preferred to play games and was very interested in learning rather than training he always had a desire to help the sick and wounded which led to him spending most of his time around the healer tents and huts assisting whenever he could this was where he picked up the healer trade and became an assistant to one of the village healers several years past and he eventually became a fully practicing healer his ability to use a bow made him perfect for traveling with hunting parties he actually enjoyed that because he felt he was doing a lot of good by helping gather food for the village one year ago he was assisting a hunting party when they stumbled upon a mordok camp before long the mordok swarmed like bees around the party it was all the hunters could do to fend off the attackers jarta quickly started tending to the wounded suddenly a shaman jumped out from the trees and blasted jarta with a wave of power the able bodied hunters were too busy to notice the new threat the shaman stepped over one of the wounded hunters and started casting again jarta knew it was going to be a bad spell just by seeing the amount of energy the shaman was gathering as the shaman let the spell loose an orb of black energy shot from the shamans hand jarta leaped hoping to intercept the oncoming attack he made it the orb struck jarta in his left shoulder blade blowing apart most of what attached his arm to his body he instantly passed out from the shock he awoke to find a bunch of healers and a daughter standing over him he was back in the village and was told that he was carried back by the surviving hunters the daughter also told him that his left arm would never work well again due to the extensive damage this didnt sway jarta from his passion of helping those in need he has since devoted his free time to learning all he can to further improve his healing he has even picked up the ability to read and write but on the off chance he isnt tending to the wounded or studying he can be found singing andor playing a few odd instruments to calm his nervesplayername kendra seering character iris treemaster race ulven gender female age10 bio i was a young ulven in a small village north of hazemane village i was in the middle of trading with a syndar when the mordok found my town our village was hidden from sight by large granite outcroppings and was relatively unknown when we found out about the mordok it was too late they attacked us and killed some of our people and somebody was corrupted when i tried to help my family by healing them the best i could they told me to run because they thought i was more important i training to be a daughter of gaia and able to perform healing magic though my skills are currently limited my family knew my skills would improve and be far more useful in the future the leaders of my village had sent a team of bodyguards to protect me and sent me away right when another group of mordok attacked we almost got away but we were ambushed though they were excellent fighters normally they werent very good fighters against mordok well not very many people are good against mordok i was so scared that i passed out in the middle of the battle and the mordok thought i was dead so they just left me there i woke up and got away heading south like my village elders said to do i was alone and scared and i was traveling for a week on my own i passed out again this time from no food little water and no sleep when i awoke an elder daughter of gaia was cooking food i had a blanket and water she helped me advance my skills for the upcoming trials as we traveled south together but eventually she had to return to pack i learned that she was a lone traveler from pack fieldcrow and she invited me to seek them out to learn more about magic we parted when we linked up with a merchant caravan heading south all i knew was to make my way to the coalition or allies of clan ironmound it would be nice to try to hope most of our people made it safe out of our village so i will seek them out later on i had found lots of food and water while training for what comes ahead and my challenge

the retired warriors of the pack i wanted nothing more than to be like my father and the great longfang warriors i had hoped to make my father proud and to have a name worth being heard by the great

normally braids her hair having an affinity for water she commonly wears light blue and sky blue colors frithas childhood was that of many of the ulven children in her village she was born to two loving parents and grew up on a farm and when she was old enough to walk her chores began anything from helping her mother with cooking and some of the house chores to helping her father move firewood or repair fences fritha grew up alongside her parents as a farmer fritha took a close fondness to some of the animals including a favored goat and some chickens she named she was always running out to feed them and make sure they were accounted for sometimes numerous times a day as she grew older frithas mother began teaching her the ways of the ulven and began her lessons in becoming a daughter of gaia her parents also blessed her with two younger brothers the small village they lived in was near the coast on the western edge of stormjarl territory coming from pack stormjarl frithas village was one of many villages that made up the enormous central pack of clan stormjarl each village reported to a representative to the clanleader himself and tradesmen and daughters in training could travel to the massive settlement that was home to the clanleader and his family in exchange for an easier life and protection frithas immediate family would fulfill their duty by farming and teaching the local ulven children about the ways of the ulven and specifically would work with some of the young girls to begin them for their journey to become daughters of gaia frithas mother was very traditional in the scope of her duties to her family and her pack and with her father coming from a line of wealthy landowners in clan stormjarl she had a bit of a proper background if one could be expected from the ulven she firmly believed that the daughters of gaia held a revered post within ulven society and were meant for better tasks than some of the day to day struggles and left most of the dirty work on the farm to her husband it was no surprise then that she was a bit at odds with her mother when fritha would roll up her sleeves hike up her skirt and jump in the muck and mud with her father to help with the farm and with the animals she was not afraid of hard work or of getting dirty frithas mother was not either but every attempt at persuading fritha to return to more pressing duties such as the faith of the daughters and of their sacred rituals was met with resistance it also did not amuse her mother when fritha would disappear for hours with her father and her brothers going on mini adventures and learning how to fight with a sword the family farm also had a lake nearby that fed into a river and fritha would spend hours swimming and enjoying the cool and clear waters fritha eventually learned to love gardening tending to plants and herbs and trading the extra vegetables and crops to the other villagers this is how she met thrand a local farm boy whose father was also a wealthy landowner thrand sometimes came to the village with his family to trade goods and visit the shops hungry thrand once picked a yellow flower and presented it to fritha in exchange for a turnip and although the flower held little value the amusement was enough to hand over the turnip to the hungry boy they talked for a short and become friends and over time would play and visit each other periodically when thrand made a visit to the village but they lived too far apart to become close friends fritha became a friend to a number of the other pups in the village holding her own in scuffles between them and standing up for the younger ones several times some of the young ulven would pick a fight with one of the smaller pups and fritha would step in on their behalf one time a bully of an ulven child told fritha he would knock her head so hard her fangs wouldnt grow in if she got in his way fritha tried to ask the bully to stop and attempted to be diplomatic about it quite a feat for someone that one but a byproduct of her initial training as a daughter the bully refused when diplomacy failed fritha resorted to force instead of backing down fritha tackled him and beat him up and caused the bully to cry ending his small reign of terror on the younger pups fritha became well known throughout the village and continued her studies as a daughter her progression would expand her powers of the divine and her affinity to tap into the other school of magic came to her quickly her mother was proud with her progress and continued to teach her even as she grew older fritha still kept rolling her sleeves up and helped her father on the farm and knew how to care for the animals fritha even became quite skilled with a sword when her father began to teach her in earnest how to fight teaching her some of the basics of combat and how to hold and use one of the wooden shields he had made they would spar and practice after their chores were finished and her father would call her his little shield maiden much to the dismay of her mother then the messenger hawks came strangers from a distant land had arrived on the coast in clan nightriver territory the rumors said they looked like ulven but they either had the eyes and fangs of ulven pups but were full grown or pointed ears and colored skin fighting had broken out as these strangers these outsiders came into conflict with the clan nightriver ulven in the area they fought with skill in ranks of metal armor and used weapons never before seen by the ulven a call went out for help from the clan either to fight or to assist in the warriors who would repel these invaders a number of people from the village volunteered and as part of her testing to become a daughter fritha volunteered to go and use her magic to help a handful of other helpers and her childhood friend thrand all packed up their belongings and traveled east across the yurnai river and into nightriver territory for months they helped gather supplies heal the wounded and assist where they could the number of wounded and dead ulven was staggering the ability for these strangers to fight was unlike anything the ulven had ever seen before fritha truly understood her role during this time as she was tending to the wounds of the fallen and to the spiritual needs of the ulven around her several times fritha would help a fallen warrior too mangled to save but not yet on his journey by sending him off to meet the great wolf with an honorable prayer and a merciful dagger between the ribs in these gruesome days fritha discovered two things one was that she now knew that her role as a daughter may sometimes be unpleasant and that she was willing to do what was necessary for her people and two this is when she genuinely took an interest in thrand he had learned the healing arts and worked alongside her to help the wounded and they started to get to know one another after the truce was called and clan nightriver allowed the outsiders to stay the volunteers returned home fritha returned to her duties and thrand to his they continued to meet and grow closer over the year thrand eventually asking if fritha would someday become her mate he would surprise her randomly with small yellow flowers a thing that had become special between them thrand learned more about healing arts from her and fritha expanded her skillset to that of archery and hunting under the guidance of thrand one day frithas world was flipped upside down when thrand came to see her he had packed all his belongings into a pack and loaded some supplies onto a small hunters travois thrand was leaving he had been selected as an honor pledge to serve pack longfang far to the northeast and he had came to say goodbye he was departing in the morning with a handful of other clan stormjarl honor pledges to serve permanently another pack fritha was heartbroken and tried to talk to her parents if there was anything she could do fritha had come of age and was becoming a strong young woman her power growing as a daughter of gaia and she had enjoyed the thought of becoming a mate to thrand and then working on their own farm her mother and father both told her that her life was hers and her choices were hers and they would support her no matter what reassuring a decision she had technically already made she hurriedly gathered her belongings she spent the night talking to her parents knowing that she would not see them for a long time they were proud of their daughter her mother gathered food and her father gave her a leather pack to help her along her journey her brothers also respected her decision jealous that she was about to start a life of adventure and be with the legendary warriors of pack longfang in the morning fritha embraced her parents one last time and then made one last stop at the animal barn she said goodbye to the old goat she had befriended for years and some of the other animals and then ran into the village to find thrand although he meekly protested thrand was happy to see her and glad she was coming with fritha had told him that she had chosen to go with to study under the witches at the onsallas village but he knew that was only part of the reason they traveled the long journey to pack longfangs outpost across all of mardrun it was lonely and foreboding but the two of them did it together and solidified their bond and became mates upon arriving to the village fritha immediately began working under the tutelage of rill of the water eyes she too had an affinity to water and used it in her rituals and meditation the harsh change from a simple farming village to that of a warrior outpost on the fringe of known territory was quite a shock to fritha but she quickly learned the ways of the pack and knew how to support the warriors the looming threat of not earning her place amongst the pack and being sent home or traded off kept her skills sharp and her mind at the tasks at hand she developed her fighting skills over the years and solidified her grasp on both forms of magic maturing quickly in this rough environment fritha has worked closely with thrand to make sure that the outpost is well supplied and that the warriors have what they need and her role keeps her very busy pack longfang warriors can eat a lot of food and making sure they are fed hearty meals to stay strong is quite the task many of the warriors respect her as both a daughter of gaia and as the matriarch of the outpost differing to her judgment and making she that she has what she needs to assist thrand in his duties although she is proud to wear her fanged flag and called herself a member of pack longfang fritha often finds herself missing her previous home and her

spirit realm she learned to hate them with a passion and rightly so one night freya was perched on a tree stump near the campsite on watch the fire was low and most of the hunters had fallen asleep she was exhausted from the days work and trying very hard not to doze off as she sat there nodding off a mordok snuck up behind her and grabbed her by the neck clasping its filthy hand over her mouth it started dragging her back but only managed to get a few feet before freya clamped her sharp teeth around one of its fingers and bit it clean off screaming with rage the mordok threw her to the ground where she managed to roll back and start crawling back towards the campfire gasping for breath her windpipe nearly crushed she tried to make it back to camp to warn the others but the mordoks scream had done it for her it grabbed her by the ankle and dragged her backwards she watched as it raised its wicked blade glinting in the moonlight and was ready to accept her death as long as the others made it thats all she cared for thankfully one of her pack members ran towards the scream and got there just in time to save her he slaughtered the mordok and dragged her back to the safety of the pack it was a large mordok raiding party that was passing through for unknown reasons the mordok are filled with hatred and kill without cause they were eventually dispatched but many fenrir were lost freya lost her father in that fight his body was completely surrounded by slain mordok the number varies from story to story but many say he killed around 30 of them before he was overrun his body was a mangled mess some say his spirit still wanders that area in the form of a bear protecting wanderers from the mordok and that the mordok now fear that place freya was overcome with grief with the loss of her father and blamed it on herself for her lack of vigilance on watch though her pack tried to reassure her that she had woken up the entire hunting party through her valor she knew the truth if she had stayed awake nobody would have died or at least that is what she told herself from that point forward she was restless with village life her fathers death had changed her she packed a small bag of essentials and her bow and left the village she was determined to prove to herself that she was strong and could hold her own she has spent the last few years roaming mardrun and killing mordok she keeps a string of mordok teeth with her one for each mordok she kills she has matured greatly while living on her own freya is very observant of others and slow to trust humans and syndar she is more at ease with ulven but still wary she is also quite feral and distrusts magic users as magic is unnatural to her at times her mischievous nature shows when she is in a settlement or colony most of the time she prefers to stay alone but her curiosity often overcomes her in town situations where people are interacting she tries very hard to maintain a hard outer shell but the truth is she misses her pack and having companions and that shows with her interactions with others the only thing that is steady with her is her hatred for the mordok and willingness to work with anyone to kill them character notes freya speaks in a low raspy voice since her windpipe was nearly crushed by the mordok freya is illiterate she can not write or read she hates nothing more than the mordok she is wary of syndar and magic users rev means fox and anda means spirit in old norse languageplayer jeff mork character fiendskap darkcackle race ulven gender male born fiendskap darkcackle of pack darkcackle of clan stormjarl birth year 231 age 32 class rogue notable traits xenophobic theyre animals you know they dont have souls fiendskap is able to work with other races but does not like it he recognizes that the other races are intelligent but does not see them as sentient beings to him their value is only in the services they can provide his view is that the ulven are the only race worthy of partaking in the afterlife he would think no more of killing a human or syndar traveling companion that has proved itself untrustworthy then of putting down a lamed barn cat probably less he may have liked the cat extremely hesitant to kill ulven fiendskap is highly focused on the afterlife and how his actions will affect his name while he feels no hesitation at killing animals like the humans syndar mordok or undead he feels that wrongly taking the life of an ulven is a crime he would be committing against his very soul if you want to understand fiendskap darkcackle and arent willing to ask him yourself your best bet is to ask his uncle and former chieftain agnor darkcackle of clan stormjarl agnor will tell you all about fiendskap he will tell you that fiendskap was born in the eastern forests of clan stormjarls territory just like all of the other darkcackle that he grew up on his familys farm just like all of the other darkcackle that as a boy he learned to laugh instead of cry when he was hurt in addition to when he was amused until he could not tell the difference just like all of the other darkcackle that he learned his fathers trade carpentry in fiendskaps case and how to hunt and farm just like all of the other darkcackle he will tell you how fiendskap is just like all of the other darkcackle until you give up in disgust or get angry enough to draw your sword then if agnor doesnt think he can take you and only then will he tell you something different agnor will tell you that the mordok attack that took fiendskaps family was unexpected pack darkcackle is located in the eastern part of clan stormjarl lands currently under grimward occupation in the great forest just north of the yurnai rivers delta they are almost as far as you can get from the dirge swamp even further southwest than clan grimward who provide a ferocious shield members of pack darkcackle are content to live their lives away from outsiders far away from any settlement worthy of the name they dont even carry weapons except for hunting or practice perhaps that was why the mordok found them perhaps they stumbled upon fiendskaps home while seeking invisibility in the forest that provided pack darkcackle its seclusion perhaps they were foraging for food on their long trek south to softer targets perhaps the mordok were lost in the end it didnt really matter why after the attack fiendskap asked if he could travel north to help pack longfang near the dirge swamp agnor agreed what more could you possibly want to know what agnor wont tell you about regardless of how hard you press him is the laughter it was the laughter that first caused agnor to turn down the path towards fiendskaps farm although he now turns from the sound of laughter in the day he turns towards it every night in his dreams after all its uncommon to hear such sustained laughter from a solitary adult he walks quickly looking ahead for signs of danger until he spies it hidden in the ferns off to the side of the path agnor was so perplexed by the suffocating stench of rotting meat that he had failed to recognize the scent of mordok the foul odor is forcing itself down his throat now though he notices the boot pierced through the sole by the primary punji sticks now erupting cleanly through the top held in place by the secondary sticks the mordok didnt even realize till it tried to remove its mangled foot agnor could read the ground as well as his own lore book the uneven scores in the blood drenched ground told of the frantic slashing with sword till the leg was free of foot the bent and crushed grass in multiple directions of the crawl to escape the thicker blood and matted grass of where the creature stopped and expired the grass evenly smothered as with the drag trail of game unwillingly he grabs a fallen branch and starts to run his muscles already knotting in anticipation of what his mind cannot yet remember he burst into the clearing as the laughter suddenly ends in it he finds a scene that he still actively denies fiendskap is sitting on a stump near the fire he turns quickly as he starts at agnors arrival dropping his food and fluidly nocking an arrow fiendskap is only half a heartbeat from loosing the arrow as he recognizes his chieftain and freezes for entirely too long before releasing the tension its at this point when agnor usually becomes aware of his dreaming but that only makes it worse as he continues to watch without his consent his mind free to languish in the details he missed the first time around his focus widens from the tip of the gleaming broadhead to take in the sights of the yard the two dark hides scraped and stretched in their frames the neatly stacked pile of meat festering in the sun the discarded toothless tongueless severed heads near it there was an even smaller scattering of mordok fangs that might have made the rune for forgiveness at least they might have before the majority of them were savagely kicked into the not so small fire a fire that agnor now recognized as the remnants of a funeral pyre theyre animals you know they dont have a soul was the first thing fiendskap said while seeming to look directly through agnors i know the daughters will say the mordok i have killed will tell the great wolf my name but they are wrong dead wrong these ones certainly wont i made sure of it when i came back from the hunt i found them they were eating my family people dont do that people have souls they may think they may be intelligent but the mordok are not people people have souls followed by a sudden giggle you know my father always told me that i would never need to train for war that a mordok a syndar or a man they would all die the same as an animal that i should focus on hunting that i should kill two birds with one stone he was wrong a mordok doesnt die the same as an animal i cant honestly say about a syndar or a man but i suspect they are the same when you shoot an animal if you dont kill it outright that is it will keep running even if its dead on its feet it will run until it dies standing and falls to the ground not a mordok a mordok knows when its beaten all you have to do is give it a mortal wound and it lays down it will scream in pain it will curse at you it will wish its foul deeds upon you and yours and it will lie down only when its words have no effect and you are still calmly watching it die will it show any spirit it will realize that you will not leave that you refuse to finish it that is when the mordok thinks it might still have a chance to live it will call to its fellow to kill you it will call to its fellow to heal it but its fellow cant come not if youve already killed it its not the mordoks fault so you try to help you wear the skin of its comrades hands and bandage its leg but it runs away no matter how you try to help it is too stupid to heed your warnings and stumbles into your trap when it finally frees itself it does something so stupidly profane that you cant excuse it you need to end it then you are left with yourself alone all alone without anyone no matter how hard you try you cant laugh anymore that is when agnor wonders as he does every night why the laughter is so loud in the dead silence until he blessedly awakens to realize that the laughter is his even if you were there next to him as he woke at his weakest agnor would never tell why he is laughing that he failed to discover the courage to ask fiendskap what he was eating just like all of the other darkcackleplayed by seraphina

father only because she had only met him five times in her life as to her and her mother tiresia he had the pack to take care of and with that came responsibilities hardly in their area much anymore as it was known to their little family he still had work to do and apparently the whole pack to lead unknown to them their entire territory and their family would be caught up in war through her childhood tiresia taught echo many things trekking through dense forest while there family village moved its location showing her the herbs animals and plants along the way though whenever her mother would go out she was always left with the familys best archer calliope who taught her to lodge arrows into even the most narrow of spaces showing her how to draw knock and pull while hidden by brush or simply working on how silently she could move by playing games of hide and seek though as she became familiar with her bow she found it difficult to arch the natural right handed style and later came to find that her style was of a lefty all while theyd train they would find things for village healers and daughters of gaia to use for helping or trading as time went on her usual day would consist of playing with the other children in her village while they settled into the new permanent location closer to the rest of the heart of the nightriver clan echo would sometimes do chores for her mother in between building up the new foundations chopping wood fetching objects and catching games between resetting traps as years kept going by echo grew tired of the village life she wanted adventure she wished for a way to get out and to see everything yearning for travel she confided in her mother telling her of the wonderful and exciting things she wanted to see about learning everything there was out there and to explore all over mardrun at this her mother was both full of joy and sorrow as she told her of the guardians a group dedicated to not only protection but learning echos mother had met several of their members of the years and learned of their ideals and goals and knew that her daughter would fit in well with them after giving her a pendant special of the family she pushed her to get ready because in a year she would be moving on her own ways the year started slowly echo hunted with the hunters of several packs to ready her feet for the runs that lay ahead she improved her archery with the bow her father left in the mantle of their home a long cherrywood beauty with a leather wrapped handle right before echo was to leave she was delayed when her mother came down with a fever in her delusional state she made a vague mention of a possible half brother missing now for years echo didnt know if it was a simple dream or if there was truth to it soon after the fever broke her mother gave her no more information and avoided the subject with her health returning echos mother arranged to have echo travel with the guardians until she could make contact with the other packs in clan nightriver she hopes to find more information on her supposed half brother and learn more information and lore along the way as she journeys and explores the dangerous land of mardrunplayed by diana vertein name dria northwind gender female race ulven hair brown eyes brown birthplace beothunk clan relationships azra steelfang  traveling companion my name is dria northwind i come from the far north and east from the beothunk clan my clan was untouched from these new settlers from across the great sea i may be the last from my clan so please let me tell you the tale of my people as i have come to know it we were a small group who only wished to preserve our heritage and honor the great wolf and at first we did just that originally from the south farming on the plains but long ago in the time even before that of my grandfather these beast came from the west they had always been out there bothering us in small bands but never gathered together to attack like they had then they were fierce warriors and chased us out of our land in generations since we have continuously migrated away from these aggressive and hostile people you call mordok our history has always been one of movement being displaced from time to time pushed to the far corner of this land by tribes of bloodthirsty mordok for we like all those in the pack only wished to live close to nature hunting only for food and skins for clothing we lived in harmony with the earth we knew which plant to use for food and medicine but the force of these mordok made us take stand members of our clan rallied us to take action and fight not run these were our lands from gaia and the great wolf belonging not to these crazed savages so rally we did we trained and became skillful warriors and then we to shared in this history of violent warfare the first of our stands was not to long ago when i was still saw as a child yet being that young did not hinder me i picked up my fathers hunting bow and a small hatchet and fought along side my fellow people i remember the fear i felt when i first saw the mordok up close they are ugly things with flesh from their kills hanging on their bodies their clothes muddy bloody and torn they care only about blood and war their leaders even wear the bones of their victims around their necks after the fight i was told that i was to young that i must wait before i make my mark on our world i argued back i had fought and held my own and i would fight again and so i did just that and i started proving myself to them we held thanks to the great wolf for our victories we were beginning to reclaim our land many of our warriors shot bows as tall as they made of slender cane or wield axes and hammers even more fierce then those of the mordok i soon showed promise and was given a battle axe to replace my fathers hatchet and bow we learned to show up suddenly seemingly out of no where to attack we would retreat or escape the same way we were learning i was learning i made a name for myself being so small yet fighting with such strength and vigor and soon after we began our fight back to our homeland i fell in love he was not a fighter he understood our need to fight my need to fight but he wished there was no need he was truly one with nature and his ears will ring with his name i am sorry it pains me to think of him even now it seemed the harder we fought the harder they fought the more we killed the more that came and sadly after years of us holding our own they came with to great of numbers and crushed us im not sure how many if any survived but my lover did not he gave his life fighting off so many at once so that i could escape into the night i ran throughout the night and all the next day i just kept running till i ran into more clans and heard these rumors of new people and new hope so i head to these lands now for a new start to meet with these new people anyone who is against those damned beast i will gladly call friend maybe together we will finally be rid of these cursed creaturescharacter name brynja blackpaw player sadie raab race ulven class warrior born august 239 known skills martial abilities focusing on shields and largeweapon fighting instruction pack blackpaw is an anomaly among the ulven race we are fierce proud warriors from clan nightriver each and every one of us our farmers our merchants our healers above all our daughters a group i am glad to be a part of most of the ulven seem to think that when we die our spirit travels to meet the great wolf and in that regard they are correct where they start to drift from the truth is in what happens next they believe that if he has heard your name and you were an honorable warrior in life he will invite you into his pack to hunt with him for the rest of time theyre deluding themselves they perform their heroic deeds then let themselves grow soft complacent in their history what they refuse to accept is that meeting the great wolf is simply the first step you are called to challenge him to an honor duel you are not expected to win but rather show your skill and honor in battle if he is impressed then you will be rewarded with a spot in his pack if he finds you wanting your soul is devoured left to wallow in agony within his belly for eternity this is why the daughters of pack blackpaw forego many of gaias gifts eschewing magical talents for physical ones we still act as spiritual guides for the pack but we do so by training their minds souls and bodies for that final duel we are instructors not priestesses this is also why i am a daughter of pack blackpaw i am brynja blackpaw and always will be that is the name the great wolf will hear when my time is at an end but it is not the one i was born with my birth name was brynjolf axhound and my parents were thrilled i was energetic and healthy as a child and to them i seemed happy one evening shortly after turning four years old however we had a conversation they thought would be innocent but changed our lives forever my son tell me my father began what do you want to be when you grow up a great warrior who defends the weak a skillful hunter serving as eyes for those you protect a sturdy farmer providing for your community where does your path lead you papa dont be angry with me i could never brynjolf why would i be angry i want to be a daughter of gaia silence fell quickly over the table and lingered for what seemed like an eternity when finally it was broken it was my mother ever compassionate who spoke addressing my father hes just a boy he doesnt know what hes saying leave it be hell come around i never did though for the next few years i would play and speak almost exclusively with the young females in my pack they were welcoming at first eager for a new face though i was gradually seen as an outsider as some of the older girls came of age and started to notice changes it was at this point around three years after that first conversation that i knew i needed to speak to my parents again they had watched my behavior and knew this was no longer just a phase this was a part of me that would never change clan axhound is not known for their progressive views however and standing in defiance of the roles of a male or female would bring ridicule on both my family and me as their only child my parents wanted most of all to see me happy so they agreed on the proper course of action i was to be sent to pack blackpaw deep in nightriver territory i would change my name act and dress as the new person i would become i could learn the ways of the daughters without standing out due to my lack of a magical gift i chose the name brynja as a tribute to my parents and we prepared to depart in the night without a word to the pack the day we arrived in blackpaw village was the most bittersweet moment of my life my heart was breaking because i knew that in a few short moments my parents would leave forever at the same time i was rejoicing in the freedom i would surely find in pack blackpaw and was thrilled to finally live as brynja my parents hugged me a final time and sent me on my way when they first arrived the humans struck me as an oddity at best and a threat at worst we as most ulven did tried to exterminate these invaders as they arrived on our shores as the initial fighting died down however many of the humans and syndar displayed a level of honor in their fighting that i had thought beyond them over the years they have earned my respect as a race although there are many among them who seek to ruin that reputation now with the civil war the threat of the mordok the shadow of the hungry ghosts brought by the colonists and gaia knows what else is out there who knows if i will make it out alive i do know this however when my time comes the great wolf will hear my name and he will remember it name bryech savagefang played by cole potter age 18 race ulven class fighter bryech savagefang a normal ulven child raised in pack graytide he lived with his mother and father in a small village where bryech had taken to combat quite quickly and was quite skilled in the art of killing his father had given him basic fighting training and hand to hand combat his father davrik savagefang was defeated in a firstblood honor duel he wasnt the same afterward he grew depressed and didnt talk to anyone but bryechs mother and bryech until five months later he was spouting out about the solution to his dishonorment he disappeared the day after with a message on the table saying he would fix everything and would be back within the month three months later and still nothing his family was now truly dishonored he was told constantly my father was a coward and that the great wolf will spit upon his name bryech knew something was wrong his father is a capable warrior and he would not just abandon his family so he ran away and went to look for my father he survived for a year on his own but just barely that year helped him hone his skills taught him how to be silent and patient to learn his enemies habits to use his surroundings to his advantage to not fear death or pain how to track and observe it also taught him to enjoy the finer things like books and texts from the ancients and our ancestors who lived here long before us most people find it hard to believe that bryech can read sometimes he does too he taught himself mostly after some teaching from his mother before he left however his year in the wilds of mardrun had taken a toll on bryech he was near savage by the time he met victor he took bryech into the bloodfangs and put him into their ranks and had him trained officially by krieger where he was put through training and has since then been his main objective bryech still believes that his father is alive and he hopes to find him one day but until then he lays low he cant let anyone know of his true origins he has no quarrel with the humans and syndar however he still doesnt trust them due to the fact that the early conflicts between the races were very bloody he generally doesnt trust anyone but thats not the point the humans and syndar are the cause for this war a war one the likes of has never happened before he still does not feel the need for them to return to their homeland but if an individual from either group can prove themselves to bryech he will have no problems with them bryech quite thoroughly enjoys what he does being a warrior of the bloodfangs is honorable and very deadly his life is almost a perfect picture where it not for his tragic history that doesnt generally get in the way with his life so he ignores it as much as possible however due to his past experiences with clan grimward he has a growing hate for them and generally doesnt mind meddling in their affairs   after separating from the bloodfangs bryech joined pack longfang and quickly earned his place amongst their legendary warriors making a name for himself in his new pack by being heavily involved in the day to day life of the pack and several of the expeditions into the dirge swamp not even a year after joining pack longfang bryech deployed with their warriors to the stormjarl territories where he fought with his fellow longfangs against the grimward assault the story being well known amongst both sides of the ulven civil war the warriors of longfang were decimated leaving only three survivors bryech savagefang orrin kair and azra steelfang though azra became very inactive after the battle bryech and orrin continued to be leaders amongst their peers and continued the fight after the battle of black wolf creek participating in one of several raids against clan whiteoak though victory was hard won it brought them glory nonetheless after stanrick longfang was chosen as the first chieftain of pack longfang bryech began to feel very alienated by the very people he had considered family and after the death of his close friend orrin kair at the final battle of the watchwolves he began to consider if his fate lies elsewhere he was pushed to leave pack longfang after being transported deep into the dirge swamp after coming into contact with the artifact left by former runeseer solveig longfang bryech was then captured by the mordok and held prisoner for months in his eyes he had been abandoned by his pack after resisting stanricks rise to power bryech thought that because he was viewed as a threat they had left him to die bryech was later found and rescued after escaping and finding another expedition into the dirge ironically with members of pack longfang attending after a harrowing series of engagements and many close calls bryech was taken to safety by his friends thrand and fritha stormjarl as well as reyna longfang a staunch ally of the young warrior if a bit fearful of his temper and fighting skill after recovering from his wounds bryech made his intention to leave longfang clear to reyna and again separated from his pack shortly after leaving longfang bryech traveled to clan ironmound territory and fought in several smaller battles against grimward there he became close friends with another warrior named calder and saved his life in battle bryech lived with calder and his family on the outskirts of the village of freyby soon becoming romantically involved with calders sister ingrid and becoming like a son to his parents bjarke and gunhild it seemed as though bryechs story was over and he would settle down and live a normal life but his anger had grown from that of a young boy who sought revenge and couldnt control his emotions to the more mature true fury of a veteran warrior though he was young even by ulven standards to have been so scarred by battle it forced him to carry himself differently and he gave up his new seemingly perfect life to return to the fight he knew carried on rejoining pack longfang once again after the announced death of stanrick longfang and a brief attempt at helping to quell the rise of holmar bloodmoon and finding his efforts unnecessary and wasted bryech quickly reminded those who doubted him why he was worthy of a second chance rising to the position of weaponsmaster even though not fully granted the position before performing the duties and assisting longfang as staunchly as before he parted ways with them distinguishing longfang in several fights against the mordok including the evacuation of clan riverhead where he lead the warriors of pack longfang in a resounding victory against the mordok alongside his close friends and allies also the recent and much discussed great wolfs hunt leading a small contingent of longfang warriors who were vital to the success of two war packs and the defeat of two large forces of mordok before pulling back with some of the more seriously injured after sustaining serious injuries himself leaving several brave volunteers to continue the fight and earning several more victories for their own glory and the glory of pack longfang only a short month later he was fully granted the title of weaponsmaster and leads his warriors taking every opportunity to fight alongside

taking out as many as i can of the mordok who inhabit our lands i was born in the spring of 18 years past my parents crewger and rasaleane steelfang and my brother sathenus welcomed me into this world vowing to make me the greatest female warrior in our small but very fightingoriented village i did not disappoint them as soon as i could walk i began to train first by just going on long hikes with my brother in the mountainous terrain surrounding our home then once my coordination improved i began to fight in the beginning i was only allowed a small wooden dagger that i could spar with and although my father and brother were very patient with me i did occasionally end up with minor injuries from our sparring sessions these bruises scrapes and the occasional broken finger were treated by my mother who was so skilled in medicinal herbs and procedures that most of the village turned to her for help with their ailments mother always got annoyed at me though for no sooner would she get me bandaged up and i would be back at it fighting with all my might against my older and far more skilled opponents over the years i graduated from my wooden sparring sword to a cheap steel sword this sword wasnt the best of quality but being such it helped me be able to overcome any barriers i may face in my battles it wasnt long before my father and brother had to use their full skill to keep me from defeating them in our mock battles it was around this time that i earned the weapons i carry todaya silver shield with a golden dagger etched onto its surface and my mothers sword the shield was made for me by my brother who spent countless hours forging it in secrecy so that it would be ready to give to me on the day that i became the strongest female warrior in the village that day happened to be only a week after my 15th birthday it was a tradition in my village that any child must challenge the towns strongest fighters as soon as he or she reaches 15 years this was used to evaluate the childs fighting prowess and to try and find who the strongest fighters are my first fight was against a boy i grew up with he was but 5 years older than me as i readied myself for battle with him my hands shook with anticipation as they gripped my unbalanced sword and small buckler style shield i knew i had it in me to beat him the only question was if i could focus or not i took a few calming breaths to steady my nerves and stepped up to him we saluted each other grim faced stood ready he was dual wielding so i held my shield at the ready prepared to block an attack from any direction he struck rattling my shield with his left hand sword while striking with the right i blocked the sword and used the momentum it gave me to swing for his arm he twisted out of the way just in time so my slice fell short at this point adrenaline was pumping through both our bodies sharpening our vision as well as our reflexes i could see every minute change in his bodys position before he attacked and he could read me just as well it became a game of trying to fake the other out trying to get them to lower their guard and he won i had been watching him closely intent on every movement when i was blinded he had used the edge of his sword to reflect the sunlight into my eyes my temporary confusion created an opening for him he sliced with both swords i was able to block the first with my shield but the second sliced open the skin on my leg i hissed with pain he had gotten first blood that meant that i had to land two hits on him before he touched me again otherwise it was all over i lunged forward with an overhead strike changing my direction of attack at the last moment with a flick of my wrist the feint worked and he blocked with both weapons leaving himself open for my blade to flick in and slice the front of his shirt a thin trail of blood made his way down his chest as he glared at me between long black bangs the pressure was on nowwhoever landed the next hit would be victorious my next attack was parried by one of his swords and while he had my sword trapped out of the way he struck my only option to escape the attack was to react in a way he would never expect so instead of blocking and dodging back i pushed his sword away with my shield before dropping my still entrapped sword and quickly reaching into my sword belt for the small dagger i always kept hidden there one quick swish of my wrist opened a shallow cut on his cheek we stood there for a few seconds unable to believe the battle was really over before stepping away and saluting each other only then did i hear my family screaming their praise for me only then did i realize that i had actually won the next few hours were a frenzy of activity of fighting blocking dodging and lunging i couldnt even begin to tell how long i was fightingall i knew is that ihad been fighting for a long timeand it was beginning to take a toll on me i felt my attacks becoming sloppier my blocks coming up slower and slower until it got to the point that they barely managed to block the oncoming sword finally i turned to meet my enemy and found none other than my brother his 6 foot heavily armored frame seeming to take up all of the space i took a deep breath before letting it out in a snarla snarl he eagerly returned then just like that it was on and the adrenaline coursing through my veins gave me a newfound energy unafraid sath charged toward me slashing viciously i dodged nimbly back avoiding every one of his slices but he gave me no time to counter lunging forward to bash me in the face with his shield my head snapped back my ears ringing in my head before i could recover his blade slashed out once more and sliced open my upper armor i hissed with pain before launching a fury of attacks using my light weight and slender build to my advantage and finally finally i landed a hit on his leg opening a cut barely big enough to bleed but it did so we were tied before that thought could even fully enter my head he feinted high before smashing me with his shield and full weight knocking me back and off balance for a millisecond its the only time he needed to slice open my calf i hissed knowing that that cut will scar adding to the dozens of small scars i already owned i bowed before he pulled me into a hug and halfcarried me over to where our parents were waiting as i neared them i was surprised when sath picked up a small shieldsilver with a golden dagger inlaid in itas his shield already works so well my confusion was soon answered when he held it out to me good fighting sister he told me before turning to rasaleane who i saw was holding her sword before her i took it and looked at her questioningly she nodded and smiled so i stepped back and swung it a few times the balance was amazing i quickly dropped my old sword and shield sheathed my sword and slung my new shield on my back after that life went mostly back to normal except that sathenus left a few weeks later without a word and that now i was allowed on the front lines if there were any mordok attacks or if we wanted to go scouting for mordok once i even led a scouting party that found a mordok camp we decimated them and brought their heads back to camp for all to see and so continued daily life until 3 weeks ago when word reached our village of the missing caravan and davens reach seizing this opportunity to explore mardrun i went straight to my father and requested his permission as clan leader to leave he granted it without a second thought and i headed off the very next day without my mother and father giving me blessings of fortune and their word that they would let my brother know where i went my journey was mostly uneventful besides acquiring a companion at one of the taverns i stopped in on my way i had walked into the tavern in the dead of night and much to my surprise there was a mordok hunting party just leaving realizing that i would have plenty of opportunities to kill mordok when i wasnt hungry and tired from travel i let them go on their own instead i stepped up to the bar and ordered some mead soup and bread with venison i glanced around the tavern and chose the table in the farthest darkest corner i sat with my back against the wall watching the crowd warily the majority of the taverns patrons were menextremely intoxicated men but sitting at another table quietly drinking her mead was an ulven who appeared to be not much older than i the next time she glanced up i nodded to her then waved her over she looked hesitant for a moment before coming to sit across from me my name is azra steelfang i told her dria northwind of the beothunk clan she replied before telling me her story her village had been destroyed by the mordok so she was searching for a new hope she believed that davens reach was the place where she could find that hope so i invited her to travel there with me she accepted and so after a partial night of sleep we left early the next morning to continue our journey and now im about to arrive at davens reach the party lead by kragen bloodmoon had already left for the outpost but there were rumors of a mordok camp nearby so dria and i decided to meet up with the party of adventurers now residing at davens reach who knows what monsters well encounter after we arriveplayed by jennifer schneiderman contact info jecschnegmailcom

the field most of her waking hours had been spent meditating on what she had done she had spent years in fact all her years training to be a truthseeker the pursuit of knowledge was her divine purpose as chosen by gaia through the movement of fate that purpose that pursuit of truth had led her to the dirge swamp seeking a way to contain the magic of a corruption idol within a living person she had the necessary ritual but she could not perform it herself she needed three volunteers and through deception recruited those around her to assist including a young pup from pack longfang audhild told her volunteers that the ritual would remove the corruption from an idol she did not tell them where the corruption would go only three others knew of her intentions one being a cleric who helped with the ritual another the mage who took the corruption into his body and third their companion all of them members of arnaths light audhild performed the ritual and sealed the corruption inside ezra the mage she succeeded in her mission but did so through lies and manipulations in search of knowledge audhild besmirched her own honor when she asked gaia for the power to place an aura of protection on

life and gave him a home and a pack again biobackground info arick was born to chieftain bjornavik silverclaw the leader of pack silverclaw a small pack deep within clan grimward territory for the first decade of his life arick accepted his parents strong anticolonist views without question so did most of the pack except one horth redaxe was an older ulven who had suffered a wound to his leg whilst fighting mordok he could still walk but it was extremely hard for him to fight effectively this coupled with the fact that he was very open and unashamed about his belief that the colonists could be learned from led to him being shunned by most of the pack and forced to live in a hut on the outskirts of the village when arick was 11 civil war broke out between the anticolonist ulven and the procolonist ulven most of the villages warriors left to fight on the front lines leaving behind those unfit to fight and enough warriors to keep the village safe arick was left behind and so was horth one day arick was out gathering herbs for the village healer he was bending down to pick a plant when a loud roar made him whip around only to see a massive bear lumbering towards him through the forest before he could react the bear swiped him across the chest with a huge paw sending him flying to the forest floor stunned and bleeding arick lay there waiting for his death to come but it never did he opened an eye to see none other than horth redaxe his axe rising and falling with deadly efficiency despite his wounded leg horth drove the bear off and helped arick back to the village after that arick began visiting horth at night so no one would see to train with him he began to pick up more and more of horths procolonist views horth in addition to being a master warrior was also a poet and a bard as well and here arick found in his heart a burning love for poetry and music a love he felt great shame for feeling as though the arts were unwarriorlike and that he would be looked down upon by the other ulven if they found out about it while all the other pups in the village could talk about was coming of age and going off to fight in the war arick felt as though the war was horrible and that ulven should not be fighting one another over such a trivial matter as this why couldnt they just leave the colonists in peace when the news came that the war was over and a treaty had been signed arick felt his heart lift not so for the rest of the pack as arick was walking to horths hut that night to talk and train with his friend and mentor he heard the sounds of fighting rushing towards the sound he found that five of the older boys including two of aricks older brothers had ganged up on horth they had beaten him to the ground and were kicking him yelling about how he was a fucking colonist lover and that traitors like him should be put to death seeing red arick drew his sword and before the five knew what was happening three of their number were dead on the ground the other two tried to fight but were no match for the bloodcrazed arick when they were dead he dropped to his knees next to his mentor when i die croaked horth i want you to have my armor and shield just let me keep my axe i want a weapon in my hand when i meet the great wolf those were horth redaxes last words in this world overwhelmed by shame at what he had done arick donned his mentors armor and slung the shield over his back building a small pyre for horth with his axe as he had requested arick fled the village of his birth never to return over the next few years arick wandered mardrun taking odd jobs guarding caravans and the like without a pack to call his own and the guilt of his past eating at him he sank further and further into depression and despair eventually he found himself on the eastern end of the shield of mardrun one night in a flash he realized that he had nothing left to live for he resolved to hike into the swamp find a group of mordok and take as many of them with him to the great wolf as he could and thats just what he did his sword flashed left and right stained with the blood of his foes but he knew there were too many he received wounds a cut here a stab there and he felt himself begin to weaken he was ready to die but the great wolf would not call his name tonight out of the darkness blade flashing came an ulven who arick would later learn was named toralf grimmsvulker and following him was an axehound hunting party together they dispatched the rest of the mordok afterwards toralf praised aricks fighting skill and told him that he was forming a pack and that he could use warriors like arick and just like that arick had a pack a few months later he found himself heading south to homecharacter name alana alice tallstag player name

born it was at the age of fifteen that that look of disgust turned to hatred i was to be killed by my parents and they would be happy about it i was born with my parents ears but i had fangs that were deemed unwanted my parents were ashamed of me and hid me away saying i was very ill at fifteen when the other members of my family would learn a magical art it was discovered that i was born with no connection to the mana stream that was when my parents look of disgust turned to hatred i think it was their fault that i was born this way my family has been obsessed with keeping the line pure i am the culmination of their purity at fifteen my parents only wanted me to fade out and die my father had connections within the maykar dominion he sent me to apprentice under a surgeon the story he told the rest of the enclave was that i had taken a turn for the worst and was seeing a great doctor in the maykar dominion my arrival was the first time i attempted to take my own life i was meant to train under a surgeon who had been hollowed his name was michael i was never enlightened to the nature of his crime nor the reason he was hollowed but it didnt matter to me it took me only five days to slit my wrists i had no idea what i had done to my parents but i wanted that pain to stop i had almost bled out when michael had returned he quickly stitched my wrists and gave me more blood from some vials michael had stopped me from taking my own life he also taught me about the abyss how those of us who were forgotten by the world can go to the abyss and change to become something bigger i listened to him after that i learned his trade and helped him in healing the sick we were hearing more and more about an undead army michael said they must be the forgotten souls comeback from the abyss it was a bittersweet statement i didnt know this at the time but it was only a couple months after i arrived that my parents proclaimed me dead to the enclave i stayed with master michael for nearly thirty years then the day came when my parents arranged for me to be sent to help the thirtysecond regiment of the vandregon army i arrived with the thirtysecond regiment in year twothirty i stayed on the front lines there for nearly twenty years i was able to see the horrors of war up close and to clearly see these abyssborn souls i wanted to understand them they were magnificent and devoured just as my master had described i was also able to dissect our casualties of war and better see what makes them run it was scary the feeling of comfort i gained from this morbid learning as always when happiness is found sorrow must follow i received a letter from my family for the first time since i left home it stated that i had been proclaimed dead to the enclave and permanently removed this letter was all i needed to leave this battle i set the open letter on my bunk and left that night i wandered from small town to small town in a drunken haze i stopped when i reached aldorias coast i had no idea what to do with myself when i ran out of money i decided for the second time in my life that i should die i hung myself in a dark alleyway i felt deaths sweet grasp until a cleric happened upon me and brought me back to life i ran after that i ran until i found a small dying town called oarsmeet in oarsmeet i realized the world did not want me to take my own life so i found meager work small medical tasks to keep up enough money to stay in a drunken haze i had no idea what was happening when the village was attacked i was herded onto a ship that lead me to some new land i did as little as i could without raising suspicion and maintained a simple drunken existence until i saw the ulven more and learned of their beliefs and then there are these black monsters known as the mordok i want to see them from the inside i want to cut them open and examine their insides getting to open these presents has revived some of the life that i had lost this desire is

eagleeye vallen and my life was pretty rough to start i was born in faedrun in the the kingdom of lairthuduil i wasnt a noble or anything i mean look at me its clear im a feral for years me and my mother have been trying to fit in with the city folk but due to our horns and eyes we were never truly accepted anyway i was off track i was born feral in a civilized city so i am already looked down upon i dont know much about my father except that he is a celestial syndar other than that i know nothing my mother was a nice woman and she trusted everyone she was a very powerful mage and also took the time to plant some gardens as a hobby she also knew her way around herbal medicine and healing and often taught me how to garden and harvest her special herbs she also often taught me some of her magic and taught me how to hunt for my own food rather than to rely on trade she often talked about her father and his homeland in the kingdom of fawyth there was a great peace with my city and all was good until the undead came i awoke one morning to screaming and the smell of death i was pretty terrified back then since i have never seen anything like it after a few minutes me and my mother were able to get lightly packed with bows and herbs we ran as fast as we can out of the city and we barely made it we kept running until we reached the city of aldoria where we sold are few herbs to gain some money to get started on our new life once we arrived in our new home my mother started working as an herbalist and she found that the humans treated her better than her own kind every day she would get up to go work and every night she would come home and train me to fight she would also teach me to use magic and to bend it to my will once the undead were at our borders my mother pulled all of her money together to get on the next boat to the new world but sadly she only had enough for one passenger she sent me along with her fathers necklace to protect me at the time i had no idea she would stay behind and she sent me alone to go on the boat while she stayed at home to fight off the undead i waited for a while and then we started to set sail all i remember from that day was my mom glaring at the undead threat with her blood red eyes fighting valiantly against the mob once i arrived on land i was filled with anger my one red eye started glaring and all i wanted to do was go back and save my mom then someone with a very familiar scent came by and told me to harness that anger for i will get my chance to avenge her but that was not today he took me in and trained me until i became of age once i became of age i went to join the knights watch so i can protect my new home even though i felt like i was treated as a second class citizen all over again after awhile i became a sergeant and this is where my magical story truly begins oh you want me to keep going you want me to tell you about prison life here in the cell well first ill tell you about my first political dinner then ill get to this cold dark cell so i met a group there called the archons and their leader vazra to be honest i liked the group as it was comprised of mostly mages and it felt like home they were talking as if i could freely do anything i want and i wont have to be limited to only a few spells as an archon they told me i could spend my time studying lore or brewing potions that sounded like the life for me the only problem was that i was part of the royal guard and i cant just leave my post i actually could have devised a way to get out of the guard without just walking away but alas i didnt so i had a direct approach of resigning dumb move on my part especially after drinking a few potions that could easily have been poison on a side note the name eagleeye comes from my skill with a bow and my magic i always hit the markand it could be my red eye im not sure which so here it is i wait in this cell to be released im not a bad guy i just make bad decisions sometimes unlike most syndar i also act on impulse rather than intellectual decisions so upon release alexander vallen is met with archmage varza and is taken to his comfy new home in the spire serving as archmage alexander vallen leader of the militia and weaver of magical effectsuriel is a member of the phoenix tribe of the syndar who lived in the maykar dominion at a young age he traveled with the trading caravan and took his calling to be one of the protectors it was a duty that he took very seriously scouting ahead in the dessert to find safe places to camp and keeping night watch over the camp with the other protectors he also had the job to help teach the young phoenix in learning basic sword skills and archery at the young age of 25 uriel earned the right to where the black and red hair roach that only a warrior who had performed a heroic service to the tribe may where he earned this right by protecting the caravan from bandits that had tried to raid in the night during the fight he had saved another protectors life at the age of 48 uriel proved that his courage went further then just his fighting skills one night while traveling the caravan was hit suddenly by a fierce sand storm after hours the winds calmed but not every one was accounted for one of the young had wandered off before the storm hit and had not been seen since the loss of the child had grieved the tribe greatly they had no way of finding her after the storm and many of the protectors were convinced that to look for the child would leave the caravan unprotected and may end in more losses the mother pleaded with the leader of the portectors to send a party but to no avail moved by her pleas uriel volunteered to go on his own to see if he could find her with no way to know were the girl wondered off to uriel prayed for a sign from solarus he then looked to the sky and saw a bird who had landed on a rock it looked a him and then caught flame leavening just a feather and ash the wind caught the feather and uriel followed it to an oasis miles away there he found the young girl sleeping under a tree the feather turned from red and gold to white and black uriel kept it as a gift from solara he took the girl and carried her to the caravan returning her to the arms of her mother earning uriel the respect of the rest of the protectors uriel means fire form on high because of his post in the tribe some of the younger phoenix think he is scary and mean and sometimes he is called rude but that only lasts till they are old enough to learn what he really does for the tribe some of it has turned into a joke because the tribe understands that this is for their protection when the phoenix went to the sea uriel did not argue and went along so he could help protect his people he fought in the skirmishes against humans and at the age of 58 he stepped on to the boat and watched his home disappear from his view for the last time during the trip uriel stayed topside even while the storm raged because he never spent a night inside when the ship finally made land uriel lead a hunting party to find food as soon as a new home was founded uriel returned to his calling as a protector spending his free time exploring his new home because of his position in the tribe he had one of the few steel swords on the island he used it to help make new arrows and bows and insisted that every one at least learn to use a bow no matter what they did back home or if they had one yet when the phoenix met the people from crows landing uriel was a little over protective and didnt know if he could trust the humans but the younger members of the tribe did not have the miss trust that uriel did so he thought it best to push aside his feeling on the matter and return to his role as a protector that would watch for danger and act only if need be with finding out the undead now roam on this land uriel now travels with a small group of phoenix traveling in the land of mardrun this fits well with his nomadic personality that springs from a need to always be moving around he enjoys exploring this new land with other phoenix he still remembers fondly his days in the desert but accepts the fact that even though he is only 87 he will never see the land of his birth again uriel dreams that the young may live to see a day when the dead may rest in peace never to rise againi am

amount of valuables he had acquired to purchase a pair of swords along with the purchase the weapon smith gave him a small amount of instruction on wielding two swords of equal size aiden learned some basic principles of dual wielding but this was not formal instruction what aiden learned was mostly how to make it look like he knew what he was doing with the swords and not hurt himself while doing it aidens true skill in swords was limited to hack and slash and he knew it he learned he was most useful in combat as a distraction or when he could sneak behind an opponent and score a quick shot or two when alone aiden rarely swung his swords at another living creature when faced with danger he would hide run or sneak around it he could lead an enemy away from the caravan and then elude them in the desert but he knew he could not realistically beat an able bodied opponent in combat aiden loved what he did as a scout unfortunately his position within the trade business would be short lived shortly after aidens 17th birthday the magis yara returned from her journey of enlightenment with bad news it was time to leave aiden was resilient he didnt mind having to go but seeing the way this news divided his people and sent many into despair greatly saddened him as they phoenix made their way east they were treated very poorly they often had to pay to be allowed passage through lands when they finally reached the eastern coast they had to hand over all that remained of their wealth to secure passage across the ocean this taut aiden a very important lesson that shaped who he would become in the not too distant future it is far better to have than to have not for the first time in his life aiden felt poor not because he had no silver or treasure but because he saw those things were all that mattered to many of these people listening to the people scoff at the foolish phoenix sailing away showed aiden what he really was among them an outsider the trip across the ocean was long and difficult the other ship was lost aiden presumed they were all dead the island they found was a great relief a new start aiden quickly adapted to the new terrain his scouting skills were very valuable in the year 261 when other people were discovered and a group sent out to explore aiden was not chosen to go with he was confused why would you not send a proven scout it was like a flashback to his childhood being left out when the group came back with news of crows landing and a new continent aiden could not be held back he saw opportunity for adventure he also thought perhaps an opportunity to make a real profit one large enough he would never have to worry about being able to afford passage or a ship againcharacter name zepha de sol le fleur zepha played by violet carpenter

her back home she was often left alone with her studies completely content with her surroundings and her life those memories paled in comparison to what she had now new aldoria and mardrun her commune was one of the first ones brought in to explore the new world under the aldorian banner they brought her to mardrun during a warm summer in the year 256 the newness and the unknown dangers of this foreign land were overwhelming as were the cultures and customs of other races and the vegetation and the plants  the new variation of herbs and plants were overwhelming yet fascinating to her everything was fascinating to her she had so many questions questions about her home the new world and how her kin will continue she wanted to understand the surrounding world she was forced to live in but the questions often went unanswered they pretended it was fine they pretended nothing needed to be done or said the undead pushed them out and steered them towards what others called hope  at least thats what she was told but it was not the same she was not the same her commune kept her in the dark to protect their kin or so they said to try to reclaim what her kind used to be  to figure out how to regain their strength and numbers but things were changing she was changing not much is known about her during the five long years she wandered mardun seeking purpose and direction at the time she was fed up with not know what the future held she seldom speaks of that experience the miles walked on foot no matter the weather it was a good way to reassure her nagging thoughts that she wasnt like the rest of her commune or the aldorians that saved them from complete destruction they didnt try to understand the unraveling thoughts that never left since her first step in mardrun they wouldnt understand they never cared caring was almost a comical feeling for her almost unknown caring was what brought her pain but also exposed her to a world she might have never known she wanted to understand the land the land which brought her a piece of what one may call happiness she met him sometime after the first year on her own stumbled upon him while passing davons reach after that they spend two very short years exploring mardrun together the details are a little foggy as to what exactly he was to her she never quite understood his customs and the way humans love but it made her smile nonetheless he made her smile he was exactly what she needed a companion he was the one who made her desire to keep exploring these new lands he was the one who helped her find her purpose his kindness honesty openness and his death the pain tore at her it made her blind and absolutely devastated for a time  made her lose the sight of her purpose but after a time the memories of everything she had learned from him brought her comfort he wouldnt wallow in pain he wouldnt want that for me she wants to know more she wanted knowledge in the effort to prevent anyone else from suffering the same fate prevent death she saw herself drown she saw her path knowing it wasnt as simple as that senseless death death for no reason needless aggression those are the things that caused his death the things she saw humans use in search of power of control in this strange land  she wanted to change how things would be done by using her words and yetshe couldnt do it alone she wasnt strong enough to do so by herself she wanted to do more she wanted to know everything in hopes of a better future she cast aside her solitude and joined with a group who accepted her after another two years it felt

life for over 40 years until the colonization of mardrun valdus was forced on the ships by his family after getting injured in battle it was not his choice to leave his homeland he eventually forgave his family which consisted of his father and sister his family founded an apothecary in the newhope colony while valdus grew weary of battle and tried to give civilian life a chance unfortunately valdus had absolutely no talent except for blasting people with magic or beating them with a stick the stick of course being his preferred method valdus always thought magic was too sacred to be used solely for combat but thats all he could ever manage to accomplish he spent years trying to come up with ways to use his magic constructively such as using a variation of the push spell as a form of propulsion for carts or boats but that was a complete disaster that wiped him out most of his resources that forced him into mercenary work which he enjoyed just because he was useful again these jobs were bodyguard positions mostly protecting the client from mordok when the ulven civil war happened he again withdrew from the arts of war beccause he did not feel right about warring with the ulven and did not want to spill their blood it was one thing killing monsters such as mordok and undead the ulven were different unlike the humans they had a connection to nature similar to the syndar that he respected during this time he resumed his arcane research this time looking into ways to use magic to better understand the language of the mordok valdus has spent the entire civil war on this endeavor though it yet has to bear fruit recently his father and sister were attacked and corrupted by mordok while collecting herbs valdus now seeks to work with the coalition in hopes of curing his family he also thinks his research on a ritual to communicate with or at least understand the mordok could be useful in gathering intelligence from them and hopes to find allies among the coalition to help complete his researchthorn player tim heise age 31 born in the year 230 thorn was born 2 years before the journey to the island of the phoenix began in the maykar desert his father was a hunter

came upon him and he yelled for help thorns father heard him calling for help and with two syndar the bandits did not want to press their luck after that the two men became close friends the man had a daughter 2 years older then thorn named celeste and the two children became friends and were inseparable on the journey when it came time to board the ships there wasnt room for thorns family so celeste begged her parents to bring thorn with them on their ship thorns parents parents had a bad sense about the ship without the captain and pushed to send him and his newly born baby brother with him on the ship with the more experienced captain they put celestes parents in charge of their children thorns parents were lost at sea with the ship that didnt make it to the island all he had to

ways of enlightenment and sanctity of life through meditation and the pursuit of physical perfection of the many weapon styles taught to him by lindur and uriel thorn is most proficient with the staff a highly defensible weapon he views fighting as a tool a physical discipline that when combined with meditation will help him achieve spiritual enlightenment kyrsenshi are also taught to be very stealthy and to embrace the shadows as well as the sunlight because of their beliefs they consider the undead to be a perversion of nature and a blight on their world to be eradicated kyrsenshi are also taught first aid and a small amount of mage abilities to protect their lightly armored bodies in combat thorn studied trained and constantly sought enlightenment as a kyrsenshi he spent most of his spare time with celeste something that he never minded she understood him as well as he understood her they were raised together trained together and as the years passed by they slowly realized they had always loved one another after talking about it with raina they were joined together in the eyes of solara a custom that is uncommon in their culture he has a reserved yet friendly personality and is very curious he tends to be a bit headstrong and acts before thinking while still obeying the tenets of his order thorn always tries a diplomatic approach before resorting to

family announced they were planning to join their people and cross the sea feisty and strongwilled she had a habit of courting controversy and defying anyone who told her she couldnt do something she was a flirtatious girl reveling in the attention and devotion she drew out of the boys she set her sights on it was clear to anyone who knew her that she was going to be more and more trouble once she reached an age where her wiles would sway more than just boys a year before the announcement to set out was made sharleth had a chance meeting with a human boy of her own age while out hunting for something to do they were instantly fascinated with one another and their initial flirtations had become something much more serious in their young eyes their rendezvous were eventually ended when a hunting party from her village found the pair sharleth was forcibly dragged back to the village and she quickly became the centre of public scrutiny and gossip as the new spread like wildfire of course her parents humiliated by the news of their daughters dalliance with a human told sharleth in no uncertain terms that she was to cut off any and all contact with the boy though she screamed and protested insisting they were in love and going to be married once they were of age to do so her parents refused to relent it was a month since she has seen her human love when the decision to cross the sea was finalized when her parents told her of their plans to make the journey sharleth was beside herself with grief believing she was abandoning the boy she was meant to spend her days with so the morning of departure she hid in a hollowed out log and listened as her frantic parents called out and searched for her their search lasted hours but unable to find her they were forced to leave their only child behind when she was sure they were gone sharleth emerged and immediately sought out her sweetheart her explanation of what she had done and her joy at their reunion was cut short however in the month since they had last seen eachother the boy had found another girl and wished nothing to do with sharleth alone and terrified she wandered weeping for her losses as she realized what she had so selfishly done for months she shunned other people skirting settlements and travelers she was unwilling to go back to her remaining people whom stayed behind for fear of more anger and possible exile her only interaction with civilization was the occasional ransacking of a pantry while the owners of the homes were away eventually though she ran out of food and was unable to find any homes or camps from which to pilfer a meal time passed and as the winter set in she fell ill with a fever starved weak and ready to give up she at last stumbled across a remote cabin shivering and in tears sharleth approached the door and knocked as she silently prayed for deliverance it turned out a syndar hunter who was twice her age lived alone in the cabin sharleth swayed as the light and heat of the fire hit her face she managed to croak out a whispered help before she collapsed he scooped her up wrapped her in furs and over the next week he nursed her back to health his name she learned was illsen he was kind and doting soothing her aches and feeding her broths laced with herbs aimed to aid her recovery after several weeks together despite her obvious youth he asked her to stay with him and become his wife thinking she had at last found the love she had longed and sacrificed so much for she gleefully accepted his offer and they married soon after once married though illsens treatment of her drastically altered he began to berate and beat her for the most insignificant of infractions his near constant abuses eventually reduced the once fiery and lively girl to a weak and completely subservient bride she tried to flee several times but he always tracked her and brought her back home before she could find anyone who was willing to give her aid those living in the nearest syndar village closed their doors to her both out of fear of illsen and the belief that the problems between a husband and wife were none of their affairs sharleth finally gave up on her hope of escape and accepted her fate with illsen she had come to believe that she brought this misery on herself by choosing a man over her family in the first place she learned to tend her wounds eventually discovering that she possessed magical abilities which allowed her to hasten her healing she endured and dedicated her days to making sure her husbands every desire was met in the vain hope that she would avoid another beating he always found a reason however even claiming on some occasions that his treatment of her was a result of a doe escaping his bow and as a woman she should bear the punishment for the creatures defiance it wasnt until she had been married for 27 years that she became pregnant sharleth was terrified of telling her husband convinced he would be furious with her she didnt know how she would hide the pregnancy from him when she began to show nor could she bear the thought of drinking a tea to rid her belly of it one night as she cleaned the dinner from the table and her husband loomed into the room her hand trembled and she dropped their plates watching in horror as they shattered on the floor illsens rage exploded and he beat her severely about her face and stomach resulting in the loss of the child he didnt know she carried when her bleeding began and she realized what he had done sharleth finally found the strength to do what she knew she must if she would ever escape illsen when she had healed enough to walk she set her plans into motion at dinner she served her husband a strong ale laced with valerian root intending to put him into a deep slumber once he had stumbled to their bed and passed out she began to gather her clothing and some rations she had hidden away under a floorboard she searched his pouches taking the few coins she found there and placed them in her own pouch finally she returned to the kitchen so long her prison and picked up a knife sharleth crept into the bedroom and stood over her husband she remembered all the pain and suffering she had endured at his hands and the child she had lost taking a steadying breath she raised the knife high over her head and exhaled she wasnt sure what she had expected the sound of a knife driven into a living man to sound like but she certainly hadnt prepared herself for it illsens eyes sprang open as he screamed she wrenched the knife from his flesh and again brought it down with brutal force his screams began to take on a gurgling quality and she backed away from him transfixed at the blades handle protruding from his torso and the trail of blood pouring from his mouth and wounds without a word she turned and fled certain that she had finally ended her captivity and would be able to escape her tormentor sharleth headed straight for the coast intent on booking passage to find her family and beg their forgiveness for her impulsive abandonment her entire purse was emptied to secure a place aboard a vessel but she managed to find a ship which was bound for a port in the city of new hope upon her arrival no one had even heard of the syndar who called themselves phoenix it would be another couple of years until sharleth would learn that there was a small group of the phoenix who were travelling on mardrun deciding it would be far more prudent to approach a smaller gathering of her people and see how she was received she set out to find them again

increasingly frustrated with the lad he was a curious boy and pursued every curiosity that came his way more often than not leading him into one form of mischief or another even if it was rarely intentional he dropped out of the classes after the required year but continued to study and read books on his own when magis yara came back from her journey of enlightenment with news of the neverending plague sagrell was tremendously excited for the journey for him it was a grand adventure with curiosities galore and exciting discoveries to be made and so when the tribe set off he was ready even when his mother deserted followed closely by his father he was ready the trek to the ocean was not as glamorous as the boy had hoped but through it all his taste for adventure and curiosity kept him upbeat and invigorated when they finally reached the boats he wanted desperately to travel on the second boat but his elders fearing his curiosity may lead to trouble insisted that he travel with them on the boat led by the captain the journey was long and boring excluding the giant storm that was a little exciting sagrell found himself either practicing the arcane or up on deck peering off on into the horizon he fell ill during the journey as did most of the phoenix but he still continued to spend as much of his time as possible on the deck one day after countless others all exactly the same he spied land on the horizon he was so excited he ran up to the captain grabbed the spyglass from him and ran to the point of the ship closest to the speck of land to confirm his findings his smile betrayed him to magis raina as he bounced down the stairs life on the new island was wonderful for the boy all sorts of new things to discover and learn as he grew so did his curiosities after many years when they sighted movement far off he was quite upset that he was not among the chosen to go meet them once his fellow phoenix returned from their journey he bombarded them with questions who did they meet where were they from what were they were there any pretty girls on and on he asked somehow perhaps due to the countless books on undead he read over the years they allowed him into

and was sure to wear them all day she hopes the townspeople in the next stop are just as kind day seven we arrived in faywerth this afternoon and magister rowjak offered to house us during our stay he is a portly old syndar but has a very kind face he treats us with much respect and treated us to a grand dinner this evening this one looks forward to being his guest day eight alestear asked this one to officiate todays duties this one was so nervous she didnt feel she was ready but as she went through them they werent as intimidating as they first were it was another prayer to lunara for the harvest season this one prays to lunara frequently and found it an easy task to ask her blessing on the harvest the most difficult task was sitting in on a trial for a thief this one wasnt sure how to pass judgment but alestear was there to help her when needed she is grateful to have him as a teacher she believes he is teaching her well day nine a lot of humans have been passing through the area and causing trouble giving this one and alestear a few more trials to sit in on today again he let me take the lead this one felt more confident today and didnt need as much assistance from alestear she is pleased shes getting this experience though she kind of wishes it was for happier things she would be excited to preside over a joining ceremony again perhaps in due time day ten today was another day of settling disputes alestear has been letting this one take the lead a lot he tells her at the end of the day or during the disputes that shes doing well she appreciates his encouragement and guidance he has exceeded her expectations as a teacher he pushes her to do her best and she looks forward to many new experiences with him day twenty alestear keeps much from this one not always letting her know of the despair that plagues our continent but this one has heard she understands we may be losing this war but this one will not give up hope the gods will see us through they watch over us all day thirty today was a day full of despair and hopelessness a group of survivors found our town today many were wounded some beyond help this one did the best she could to help them make it through hope still remains for this one and she shared it with the others alestear helped tend the wounded and provided them with food and water some will be taking shelter with us tonight day thirtyone we lost a human child today this one is told his name was iain he was just eight years of age this one will attend his funeral tomorrow he lost to a fever the sickness spread quickly too quickly for this one to be able to save him alestear says he will accompany this one it will be a comfort to have him with day thirtytwo the funeral was short iain buried in the small cemetery on the west end of the town this one said a blessing for him and his family she wishes the best for them through this hard time alestear laid flowers upon his gravesite the family will stay with us tonight and we shall honor his memory day thirtythree this one woke up with iains younger sister emilia in her bed this one didnt even notice her join last night she is such a sweet innocent child of only six years its a shame she has to live through such tragedy her older brother is gone shes seen too much tragedy for a lifetime already and yet it will only continue to get worse this one will say many prayers for this child may she have a healthy life full of peace and love and may the gods watch over her day thirtyfour iains family left us today to find their own temporary residence his parents thanked us graciously for allowing them to stay with us it was an honor to have them with us this one is bound to help those who need it emilia was in tears for her brother and for leaving she presented this one with some flowers she had picked around the village this one will always remember emilia iain and their family may the gods watch over them all day thirtyfive today was another day of tending to the injured and ill this one cant imagine the devastation in other villages how many lives have been lost already this one cant bear to think of it alestear handled a few conflicts today but brought this one lunch and told her to rest he does take good care of her this one is grateful day thirtysix today emilia came running to the area where this one was tending to the injured and ill she was in tears saying her father was ill this one took her hand and let her lead the way her father was only mildly ill this one was able to provide care with a simple remedy emilia danced around this one thanking her profusely for saving her papa her mother asked this one to stay for dinner and she obliged she has taken a liking to this human family day thirtyseven alestear told this one of a situation he came across yesterday but didnt give her many details he said it wasnt really something she needed to know about and that he handled it himself this one is a little worried he seemed extremely weary of his task though there seemed to be some pride in his eyes as well perhaps it wasnt as bad as she thinks though she wishes he would share more with her alestear let this one help day thirtyeight alestear told this one that the penitent are potentially only a few days away from us though they seem to be moving away she will pray they keep moving away the gods will keep us safe she knows emilia came to visit again today as well she asked this one to walk with her and we played in a field for a little while this afternoon it brings joy to this one to see her innocence not having to know whats going on in the world around her she wishes the best for this young one and she will always hold emilia in her heart day thirtynine today was another day of attending to the sick and wounded emilia followed along bringing a smile to each patients face as she acted as her helper this one enjoys having her along and is grateful her parents trust her with this one alestear told this one he has matters to attend to tomorrow afternoon but he doesnt want this one involved she wishes she could help but she understands it is likely a matter that isnt at her ability to handle yet she will take emilia on again and continue to her duties attending to those that still need it she finds comfort in attending to the sick and wounded seeing them get better every loss is another tragedy but she understands the gods need to reclaim them but this one will save as many as she can day forty today this one saw fear in alestears eyes it was only a flash but it was there we were evacuated today the penitent will be upon us soon this one must keep her group safe and this one must not show fear for alestear this one will not be afraid day fortyone we left another village this morning tonight were hiding in a small abandoned cottage the villagers have been scattered this one prays for them all especially young emilia and her family the penitent are not far behind this one heard and what of the undead this one has only heard rumors of them hopefully she will never encounter one fear is starting to creep into this ones heart she will not let it show though she must not let alestear know she is afraid stay strong for the group and for him day one hundred seven this one says many prayers to the gods every day she prays they will see us through this increasingly impossible time villages upon villages flee to the new continent seeking refuge this one wonders if its not the safest option but alestear insists the gods will protect us and this one believes him day one hundred sixty each day brings more despair today we came upon a village that had been attacked seemingly a few days before corpses littered the streets torn mercilessly apart by their attackers this one does not understand what they did to deserve this cruel fate especially the children the group said a prayer for the lost souls but there was no time to give them a proper funeral much to this ones despair day two hundred ten this one keeps the group moving alestear insists we continue to the coast perhaps well find some respite this one isnt so sure pain suffering and hopelessness covers the continent like a choking fog for every intact village five have been destroyed the gods will watch over us though this one knows she still feels their pull they have not left us day three hundred we managed to find some peace among the chaos today this one and alestear walked along the coast as solar and lunara changed places this one offered her silent prayers as we sat and watched the waves roll in after a while alestear told this one a little about his time with his teachers out in the field he also expressed a few fears he had had about taking on an apprentice this one assured him she believes hes been a wonderful teacher she worries about leaving him to work with someone else but she knows it will happen as alestear takes on another apprentice or leaves the field this one is grateful she got to work with him day three hundred sixtyone alestear insists we leave behind our lives on this continent there is nothing for us here any longer we will flee to the new continent and attempt to rebuild today we start searching for passage day three hundred sixtyseven we found passage across to the new continent alestear and this one will be staying in a cabin the captain is syndar himself and still shows us respect alestear fell silent today this one is worried she can see the pain in his eyes though he tries to hide it this one will let him rest perhaps that is all that is needed faedrun you were so kind to us even up until the end thank you for your support but the gods have forsaken you this one knows they will lead us to a better life on the new continent day three hundred sixtyeight today marks our first full day at sea alestear has not said a word since we boarded his eyes are vacant and he barely acknowledges when this one speaks to him he would not accept any food either perhaps the seas do not work well with him the captain says that is not uncommon some more rest may do him well this one will take care of him and let him rest solar lunara please watch over him day three hundred sixtynine second day at sea alestear still wont speak he just lays in bed not acknowledging the world this one does not believe it is simply sea sickness there is something more alestear please speak to her let this one help she promises she will take care of you this one will never give up day three hundred seventy the group has asked when they will see alestear this one told them he is simply ill the sea does not sit well with him its simply sea sickness but this one knows that is not true this one knows we are beginning to lose him but she wont give up she will not let him be lost he will come back to usto this one pleasealestear day three hundred seventyone this one managed to get alestear to eat something today it was very little but it was something even the slightest acknowledgement the slightest action gives this one hope hes still in there he can come back to usto this one day three hundred seventytwo noemi asked to see alestear today she wanted to ask his blessing on this journey this one had to deny access to her this one will not let them see him like this she will continue to pass it off as sea sickness she will be the only one with access to see alestear until he is well again surely this wont last long alestearthe gods will bring you back to usto this one day three hundred seventythree this one left alestear alone for a brief time though it pained her inside the captain asked for a blessing on his ship on this voyage how could this one deny it is her duty and the captain has been so kind to us when this one returned to the cabin alestears state had not changed it seemed he hadnt even moved this one is worried she will leave him as little as possible and the others will not see him alestearyou cant give upplease day three hundred seventyfour no changes today we are still at sea the captain saying the voyage will take us about six months this one prays the gods will give alestear back to her in that time he eats very little but hes with uswith herphysically for now otherwise hes lost in his thoughts alestearlet this one helpshe can serve as some relief to youplease day three hundred seventyfive one week at sea the voyage has been slow and painful thus far this one doesnt believe its going to get any better alestear sinks deeper into despair with each passing moment and there is nothing this one can do for him the group only asks passing questions now and doesnt bother to ask to see him they know this one will deny them that access alestearwe need you day three hundred eightytwo it has been a week since this one has written she saw it as a pointless endeavor as nothing has changed it is the same thing day after day we leave our old lives behind us on faedrun and approach our new ones on the new continent alestear remains lost to us and this one clings to little hope this one will do what she can to bring him back to her but shes beginning to lose herself too day three hundred eightyeight this one will not let herself be lost a part of her may be lost but she will not be lost like alestear she must remain strong for him she must remain by his side under any and every circumstance he will come back to usto her this one believes he willknows he willshe knows it in her heart day three hundred ninetytwo this one grew desperate and asked alestear to attempt to write today she quickly learned its a pointless endeavor his writings are nothing but pain he didnt write long looked at her with blank eyes and handed over the journal and quill rolled onto his side and refused to move the rest of the day this one thought it would help him she was clearly wrong she will not ask this of him again day three hundred ninetyeight today this one writes after having endured a brutal storm a few crew members were lost to the torrent she understands she remained safe in the cabin with alestear though he never understood the situation the rest of the group remained safe below decks this one is thankful for their safety tomorrow she will lead a prayer for those we lost and for thanking the gods for the rest of the crews safetyand a silent prayer will be added for alestears return day three hundred ninetynine this one led morning prayers for those that were lost to us in the storm and also to thank the gods for the safety of those remaining onboard she kept it brief as she is weary of this journey already watching over alestear has drained her though it takes little energy she says a prayer for him every night to lunara when she is strongest though it has made no difference this one is sick with worry but she will not give up hope alestearyou will come back to her day four hundred four he will come back he will come back he will come back he will come back this one knows it day four hundred twenty this one seems to be losing it again she has not written in a few weeks she has barely left the cabin she remains by alestears side refusing to move and refusing company food is brought to us by the captain as he is the only one allowed access to the cabin he doesnt question this one he slips in and out quietly leaving this one in peace she is grateful for that he is a kindly syndar alestear will come back he will come back he will come back he will come back day four hundred thirty sleep alestear pray alestear eat alestear sea alestear rocking alestear nothing alestear sleep alestear pray alestear eat alestear this one knows he will come back he will this one will remain as strong as she can though she seems to be failing on the inside alesteardont leave her alone day four hundred fortytwo this one has been falling asleep sitting by alestears bed he barely looks at her barely acknowledges her but she remains he stares at the ceiling but she sits dutifully by his bedside refusing to move she often wakes up on the floor next to his bed stiff and sore but pleased at having refused to move from his side even as she slept she refuses to be gone in case he needs her in case he wakes up she will not miss the moment of him coming back to her day four hundred fortyfive they finally got this one to leave the cabin she walked around deck for a few hours though alestear remained on her mind she longed to get back to him though she knew his condition would be unchanged but what if he did wake up what if he needed her and she wasnt there theobold kept her out though even when she attempted to return to the cabin this one believes it did her some good she is thinking clearer than before she sees all is not lost day four hundred fiftytwo this one led a prayer this morning at the behest of the captain we still have about three months at sea and the captain requested a prayer for the last leg of our journey this one obliged though it pained her to leave alestear her heart longs to remain with him though she knows hes lost to her but he needs herhe will come back to her if only she just remains by his side and prays enough he will return to her day four hundred sixty this one has been reading alestears journal to him to remind him of who he is but she has seen the despair toward the end of his writing it pains her to read his words and to know she was important enough for him to carry on as far as the ship but not to keep him out of his misery out of his despair this one cannot bear the thought she would give anything to switch places with him she will be his strength when he needs it even in his state this one will bring him back to hersomehow day four hundred seventyfive the group leaves this one in peace when she leaves the cabin they do not question her about alestear nor do they question her about herself she is grateful for that she cannot bear to see the pain she has caused them for she knows she has but this one will regain her strength this one will remain strong for the group for him she will show them the leader that she is and carry them with her she must remain strong for them she will keep face and play the role she was born to they look to her and she will be there for them day four hundred eightyfour avery approached this one today while she was meandering about the deck he asked after alestear and herself and offered assistance if any could be given this one declined his offer knowing nothing could be done for either of them but she is grateful he asked she will reconnect with the group and lead a prayer each morning and evening for the rest of the trip she will remain by alestears side as much as she can but she must play her proper role she has not done so this voyage so far but she will show them shes strong and can be relied upon once the new continent is reached day four hundred ninetysix the prayers have been going well this one often sneaks out of the cabin and up onto the deck when she knows the group has gone to sleep to say her silent prayers to lunara alone they have not brought him back yet but she refuses to give up hope alestear is her strength and she is his this one will not let him be lost until the end of his days she will fight for him with every passing day day five hundred alestear refused food today this is the second day hes done so this one is beginning to worry more than normal alestear have you hit an ultimate low this one is doing the best she can she will remain by your side until you begin eating again she apologizes for ever having left you pleasealesteardont be giving up dont leave her alone day five hundred two alestear once again ate today this one remained by his side all day without fail avery led the prayers in her stead the past few days she is thankful he took her role with alestear eating perhaps she can return to her duties though it will always pain her to leave him behind she knows the group is beginning to suspect more than seasickness but they dont question it this one fears the day she has to explain if she has to day five hundred eleven not much has changed as is normal for the past several months this one has continued to lead her morning prayers and the group remains with her she has thus far saved face with them and they look up to her again this one is grateful it was easy to regain their favor though she only ever longs to stay by alestears side she knows his state is unchanged she knows it always will be but she cant ignore the thought of him awakening from his depression and shes not immediately there for him what if he needs her this one must remain by his side to help him through to bring him back day five hundred twenty the captain estimates we have about a month left this one is anxious to see land again to walk among trees and through fields with the sun shining brightly above her alestear by her side like it used to be alestear teaching her new things about the world about what it means to be a celestine what it means to be a leader this one has looked up to him has adored his smile cherished every bit of wisdom he has shared with her perhaps this one has even loved him yes she believes she has that is why it pains her so much to see him like this to know hes lost to her but this one will repress it and think no longer on it he is her mentor and nothing more day five hundred twentyfive a few of the passengers have fallen ill the captain believes some of the food may have spoiled causing the sickness this one visited them to see what she could do though she feels weak the voyage has taken its toll on her too but with the assistance of avery and noemi we were able to tend to those who were ill they should recover well but this one will add an extra prayer for them until they are well again day five hundred fortyseven today we finally landed after six months at sea this one wasnt sure shed see land again the colony is known as new aldoria we will rest here to regain our strength and hopefully alestear will return to us while we rest it was difficult to get him off the ship once we docked alestear wouldnt acknowledge this one and it took several times for him to understand where we were and the need to get off the ship this one is worried he will be lost forever day five hundred fortyeight we found temporary lodging at an inn today we will be staying here at least a week probably alestear is still unresponsive this one told the group he just needs some time to recover from the sea sickness though they thought it would have left him by now this one fears she will have to tell them the truthalestear pleasecome back to this oneto us day five hundred fortynine this one was forced to explain to the group alestears situation she had lied to them during the journey here because she did not want them to know she was ashamed and selfish this one wanted him to remain the strength for the group he always was she could not let them see him this way but now they know they know hes lost to us lost in a depression despair now hangs around the group like a cloud of gnats we will move forward though this one will keep the group going day five hundred fifty the old ways dont apply on this new continent this one understands that formalities are lost on everyone here its such an odd habit but this one understands there is no need for it she will begin to drop it alestear is lost to us hes lost to me there is nothing that can be done he barely eats hes given up his journal ive taken to reading it hes given up but this one will not let him die no matter what the cost this one will ensure he survives day five hundred fiftyone everyone is doing their best to care for alestear but this one can sense the despair among them how are we to carry on if our leader cant they recognized me as a temporary leader while on the ship but theyre truly alestears entourage and if we lost alestear whos to say this one wont be lost too she wont be though she promised to remain strong for him and she will day five hundred fiftytwo today was a small victory we got alestear outside to walk around he walked mostly on his own but would reach out for reassurance occasionally this one stayed by his side and while we were not out long she considers it a step forward alestearare you coming back to us to me some hope has returned to my heart day five hundred fiftythree what hope was returned yesterday was quickly taken away alestear returned to his normal state eyes staring blankly and unresponsive he wouldnt even eat today i tried talking to him but i dont believe he heard me why would you give us false hope alestear pleasejust come back to usto me day five hundred fiftyfour this one ventured out today yvonne was left to watch alestear he remained unresponsive as is usual but this one learned of another celestine in the newhope colony celestial arragones perhaps if she can be reached she can help us provide us with shelter surely shell have respect for her own kind tomorrow preparations will begin to move on from new aldoria i told alestear of this plan but he didnt acknowledge mealesteari will keep you safe i promise day five hundred fiftyfive noemi was lost to us today i found her swinging from a tree this one cannot bear to see her beautiful face so pale tomorrow her mana will be returned to the life stream this one senses it even on this continent alestear had no reaction when i told him i do not let him see the tears i dont let anyone see the pain i must remain strong for themfor him day five hundred fiftysix today noemis mana was returned to the life stream this one led a shortened version of the ceremony but she was treated with honor nonetheless they would not let us bury her in town so she is within the surrounding forest by a beautiful oak tree alestear was not in attendance he wouldnt move im not sure he understood what i told him the tears will be hidden for his sake alestearour family grows thinner and you fail to acknowledge day five hundred fiftyseven arguments broke out in the group today this one entered one herself they wanted to leave alestear behind force someone else to take care of him let him be someone elses burden no that will never happen alestear will remain with us it doesnt matter if it slows us down i promised to ensure he survives and i will do so he will return to usto me i know it alestearplease day five hundred fiftyeight avery asked to speak privately with this one today he informed me he would be taking a small group including amelie tristan thierry and delphine they were leaving our family to make their own way after the arguments yesterday they came to the conclusion that i was just as lost as alestear that i had grown desperate i do not hold it against them for leaving this one understands she will let them leave in peace and hide the tears alestear will not know the reason for their departure perhaps they are right though i have grown desperate hes been lost to us over six months now he doesnt seem as though hell come back we may as well give up noi refuse hes in there somewhere he will come back alestear day five hundred fiftynine our family grew thinner yet again yesterday but the plans carry on supplies were gathered today and tomorrow the final preparations will be made the day after tomorrow we will set out for newhope hopefully celestial arragones will have it in her heart to help us alestearim sorry to uproot you but i promised to keep you safe and i believe this move will help keep us all safe day five hundred sixty our final supplies were packed today i told alestear of the plan as i have every day but once again he didnt acknowledge we will figure out a way to move him he will not be left behind tomorrow a new chapter in our lives begins this one prays it will go well day five hundred sixtyone alestear understood i needed him to move to leave with me he walked along blankly staring at everything but as long as i remained at his side he kept up with us we stopped for lunch and one other rest though decent progress was made theobold is keeping the fire going while alestear rests in the tent though he isnt much company i worry to leave his side alesteari believe you will come back to me please dont let that be a false belief day five hundred sixtytwo alestear gave up on us today and camp had to be made earlier than expected yvonne scouted ahead and found a large enough clearing for us shes been a great help with everything thats been going on as has the rest of the group sadness follows us our family seems smaller with each passing day but we carry on i am exhausted but it will not show i will remain strong for the groupfor him day five hundred sixtythree tragedy struck us today veronique was lost to us yvonne found her in the forest a stab wound to her chest the dagger in her hand by the time she was found her body was cold and her eyes vacant she is the second death our family has had to endure tomorrow a small funeral will be held but we must leave her behind alestear remained silent when i told him as was expected he only ever looks at this one with vacant eyes perhaps he will be the next one lost to us day five hundred sixtyfour veronique was laid to rest this morning underneath a lovely aging oak tree prayers were said and blessings were given though we didnt remain long afterwards this one told the group we must continue to move on to move forward day five hundred sixtyfive today was another day of travel only we are now one person less alestear seemed to understand that but still didnt acknowledge it he is still lost to us no matter how hard i try when camp is set up he immediately enters the tent and lays down to sleep at least thats what i believe though he doesnt actually sleep he stares blankly at the roof of the tent alestearpleasei know youre in thereim trying to stay strong for youto have courage tooim here for you alestearplease just let me help you day five hundred sixtysix alestear gave up on us today we stopped for a break and couldnt get him to move any more camp was set up in a nearby clearing and we moved alestear to the tent at least we will rest here for a day or however long it takes to recover our strength were almost there alestear please dont completely give up i will keep you safe i promise day five hundred sixtyseven every passing day it gets worse hes lost to me to us we didnt break camp today to continue our journey he couldnt be moved theobold felled a stag providing us with the best meal wed had in weeks alestear ate after a little convincing it doesnt seem that he understands he needs to carry on for our groupfor me this has been the only family this one has known to lose any member would be impossible to handle weve lost too many already tomorrow we break camp and continue on whether he wants to or not some hope still remains in this ones heart day five hundred sixtyeight by yvonnes estimation were only about a half days travel from the newhope colony yvonne will leave tomorrow to look for a place for us to settle alestearwe will have a more permanent residence soon i promise day five hundred sixtynine alestear didnt move today we couldnt get him to yvonne set out early for the colony saying shed return in a few days time to help us get alestear the rest of the way that will give alestear more time to rest and recover this one is a little frustrated knowing were so close to a more suitable home for alestear but she will not push him its hard she knows its hard on her too day five hundred seventy again alestear didnt move today theobold scouted out the area and reported there was nothing of major significance in the area we should be safe a little longer yvonne should return upon the morrow and the day after we will set out alestear youre going to need to be strong for me please were almost there and i promise you wont have to move any more after that well keep you safe ill keep you safe day five hundred seventyone yvonne returned at midday she said she found an inn to take us in for a while at a fair price the owner is a syndar as well and still holds much respect for the old ways when told it was two celestine looking for a place to stay he eagerly agreed to have us stay tomorrow we will pack up and make our way to the colony alestear please its not far i promise well have you in as permanent a home as possible soon day five hundred seventytwo the innkeeper is a kindly elder syndar he gave us the nicest rooms he could which was the kindest gesture weve gotten since arriving on the new continent alestear collapsed on his bed right away and wouldnt move the rest of the day he didnt even eat which seemed to be normal based off our travels whenever we made camp he wouldnt eat that night this one will try again in the morning alestear weve done all of this for you dont give up on us now dont give up on me please day five hundred seventythree after extensively speaking with the innkeeper today i learned that celestial arragones can be difficult to get ahold of its my goal though i believe she can offer us help and we can offer her help to some degree tomorrow the search for her estates will begin this one will get her attention and offer assistance this one will keep alestear safe and she believes celestial arragones will be able to help maybe she can even bring alestear back to me day five hundred seventyfour yvonne said she found odd jobs for her and theobold to do to earn us some extra bits of income thank the gods we have her we wouldnt have made it this far without her she stays with alestear when i cannot though it seems his care will be mostly left to me with the others working thats okay the information i need can be gathered here and yvonne and theobold will gather what they can as well i prefer to stay by alestears side though i know hed be safe but i want to be there when he comes back to us this one believes it will happen soonplease alestear day five hundred seventyfive theobold delivered a letter to celestial arragones assistants today stating our name and purpose in the area

me i know shell give him back alestearyoure not completely lost to us i know you arent day five hundred seventysix alestear acknowledged me when i spoke to him today i informed him of whats been going on since weve arrived in newhope there seemed to be recognition in his eyes as well as if he indeed did know who i am that look hasnt been in his eyes since the day we lost him alestear are you coming back to us to me day five hundred seventyseven his response vaguely continued today the recognition was still in his eyes and small acknowledgements were made alestear ate more than normal today are

if the water had its way with me we occupied ourselves stole from the thoughts that we could be going nowhere after more weeks passed this fear was looked at as a reality then the call came down land sweet and real peeked the horizon as the crimson light wisped away into blue my favorite time of the day had just passed us by lanterns lit all around us as we set anchor it seemed celebration would be in order the humans we were traveling with became more uplifted yet vilmus made us go below deck the shouting continued a long while i fell asleep to them curled up next to myrta bells clanging against one another the bells seemed to be coming from all over as sleepy eyes opened to the world we never knew the wood hanging above our heads would finally be taken away the brighter skies above us loomed like a misty plane maragrimms mood soured the closer we came to shore the more she seemed to be worrying as the sight grew closer vilmus picked us up one at a time to see better like a welcoming sight of the sun in a storm people waved some jumped up and down arms waving to us from the other ships the excitement seemed to be contagious as gisella and savira danced in circles even the stern aragel was laughing with little myrta settling on this new land took its time building up homes to sleep in farms for food and walls for security when word reached our ears that others were fighting our new friends upon this land maragrimm had us prepare i now understood why she had worried so we could destroy our new home even more quickly here as we settled in she started to teach us gisella and savira took naturally to lunaras healing abilities as she taught our magic slowly came out i took to the arcane like a horse to water but even the water froze as winter hit us one hundred and eighty five is the span she left upon this world as we wept the month went on until the corruption returned her drum had ceased its tune but her body moved rot filling the air around her our curse had followed us we feared it would take us from this land as well unable to turn my head i watched vilmus sever hers from her body the flowered vines that had turned into crown toppled along with her head vilmus wept her body wrapped in his arms the brown of his armor staining a deep crimson the years left us by vilmus kept our small village together as we planted the ground anew the ulven wished us to burn our people instead of bury the soil around us often kicked up ash as we walked the essence of our lives didnt return like it used to we moved our village followed as winter months racked us til our bones cracked we dreaded these areas our mountain home called us even from so far away the next summer brought new life as lunas deep light gave us a new hope passed on i received a pendant of luna maragrimms old one time flew past us aragel grew older and he soon left us to myrtas despair having her little fist around his horn she had tried to make him stay but our older brother left us that night we havent seen him since yet our ears stayed open for tales of a spiral horned boy living in the wilds as we convened once again a decision arose vilmus was combining the tribe our bloodline numbers had dwindled but our brothers and sisters still existed the nomads of soon dispersed each caravan its own name and path we spread over the safest parts of mardrun gisella lead the caravan of song savira the caravan of passion and little myrta the caravan of wisps we made our goodbyes and set up the rendezvous for summers end hawks and runners to spread word of the paths and

suggest he is well over 100 years old race syndar gender male our earliest records of oberon place him in tielorrien around year 185 studying the divine arts there is very little to note in these years except that it seems he learned high sydarin to study old texts with the onset of the undead plague he immediately began researching the undead with intent on finding a way to destroy them en masse at some point in his research he began to believe that to stop the undead we must first find the way in which they are created and to reverse that process and to that end he tried to find a way to reanimate the dead eventually he began to work with another undead researcher by the name of aeshura records from his trial state that oberon hid the exact nature of his research from aeshura at first and when when the truth came out aeshura objected and threatened to jeopardize all that oberon had work toward so oberon murdered aeshura oberon was caught trying to dispose of the body of his former research partner which had clearly been thoroughly studied through the duration of his trial he never admitted that he was in the wrong and was eventually sentenced to reclamation a sentence which was carried out in 208 after the conclusion of his trial he becomes very hard to track but by his own admission he traveled to the maykar dominion and then to vandragon and eventually he traveled to aldoria some of the citizens of new oarsmeet said they remember seeing a strange syndar appearing around oarsmeet in year 237 oberon having adopted the moniker hollow began to shed much of the bright colors and opulence that mark most syndar and instead adopted the fashions of his new home to blend in with the populus when oarsmeet came under siege by the undead oberon was evacuated onto the blue ruby with the rest of the civilians that made it off of faedrun from the port town upon reaching mardrun he helped to build the town that would become his home new oarsmeet where he would live in relative obscurity for several years the rise and fall of the lich on mardrun piqued oberons interest and brought him away from new oarsmeet and into our sights word reached our ears in new hope of a hollowed syndar asking for any information about the lich we used the information we had on the lich as a bargaining chip in an attempt to figured out his true identity after a a few weeks of contact and our own research into celestial arragones records we were able draw the conclusion that this was oberon that we were speaking to alestear believed that oberon could be useful to the ravens so he had us send him our standard offer to join us along with the additional words in high sydarin we know who you are oberon as well as had a letter signed with the name alestear predictably oberon began to inquire around as to who alestear is we used our agents to feed him enough information to make his choice current status working as an agent of the ravens under the alias oberonplayer name brian maas my name is ofrik of the phoenix enclave from the fire isle i am a trader by profession born 120 years ago in the year 144 in the maykar desert traveling and trading with the maykar was exciting and profitable life was good but then we had to leave our magis yara had a vision from solar that required us to pack up everything and move to a distant land my life became overcome by guilt remorse and shame guilt because i didnt want to go remorse for my friends and family who didnt leave and shame for leaving so many behind the journey became a struggle for all of us who left we lost much of our wealth on the journey from thieves raiders and the many bribes it took to cross overland to the great sea no ship would believe in our quest for a new world and it took almost every coin we had left to hire 1 captain the 2 ships needed for our people and what we thought would be enough provisions for the voyage and starting over the humans took every advantage to free our pockets of coin they marked up everything they sold to us by 3 times as the voyage started we were coinless demoralized and discouraged we began the sea voyage by being split up onto the 2 ships the voyage was nothing like us desert dwellers had ever experienced cramped quarters bad food not enough food or fresh greens all because the humans had taken advantage of us to line their pockets i have no love for the humans so ready to rob steal or over pricetheir goods to get rich off the many other races i am bitter against them many of my friends sickened and died on that voyage worst of all we lost the 2nd ship we finally found land and our lives became better slowly we were wanderers and traders beforenow we have become farmers and hunters while we usually have a natural talent for magic it was not much help starting our settlement at first then we found out we were not on a huge mass of land but on an island totally isolated it was lush and green from the warmer waters around it but i missed trading with others the traveling the excitement then 4 years ago we found out there was land to the north contact was made with humans at the settlement of crows landing and some trading began we now have a caravan and life is getting better for all as it turned out we were right to follow our religious leader we left before the undead took over now everyone from the old mainland of faedrun have become exiles or a part of the undead horde that took over there the new land mass to the north is called mardrun hope is ahead of us and we will continue on to become a

sure to make myself useful when the time came and the other children built their first altar they carved them meaningfully out of stone on a small cliff side surrounded by their friends and family it was celebrated as it should be with sweets and flowers music and dancing when they painted their faces they did so with beautiful pigments and paints made from the flowers in our mothers garden i built my first altar alone at the bottom of a tree using a plate i stole while doing dishes and some dirty weeds i plucked from the garden my face was painted as it always been with the ashes and soot of my cooking fires the other children grew up as children should surrounded by joy and showered in love mother always told me i could have that too if i could just be better father always told me he often forgets i am even in the house your face your clothes everything about you is just so forgettable girl he would tell me after he tripping over my legs while i put away their cleaned clothes how can i possibly remember a thing like you is here standing behind all my beautiful children he would ask me as we walk away from the family ofrenda my offering still dangling in my grasp because i could not reach the platform with all that dark paint you just blend into the night i didnt even see you had fallen behind he would say stepping out of the doorway to let me into the house after i had to find my way home alone from the yearly parade of the dead he can laugh and scoff but ill make him remember me someday the only time ive ever had for myself is in the garden ive always found peace in the flowers in their bright colors in the promises they make me they show me lifetimes of beauty from the day they fully bloom to the day they are ground into dust and used to color my familys faces each flower more beautiful than the last i admire them even as their ground bodies are washed from faces and poured back into the earth they promise me that even something so small and insignificant can bring joy to the saddest souls i meditate there often surrounded by blooms and blossoms sometimes it feels wrong to meditate away from my altar but the amount of time i have spent nurturing the flowers makes me feel like in a way the garden is my altar too ive often looked out to the sea its still waters show me the world outside this island and without much effort i can see the land to the north and west there are times i would swear i can reach out and touch those not so distant shores i want nothing more than to leave behind what i dont have here to find a life worth living on the bigger land i dont care if everyone who lives there are all the same as the only outsiders ive encountered the ones who float by past our shores on large wooden boats the ones our elders say will only bring us harm they tell us stories about the savages that are native to the bigger land how they fought the humans that came on the first boats how they all think we dont belong here on

marrah and her parents one of the rare syndar pairs who chose to be joined were sent from the kingdom of tielorrien to aid in the development of the new colonies her father was a skilled herbalist or bellathahdien and her mother a healer or lethellerion marrah herself had only just begun her studies at the ruicalithil during the voyage to mardrun a fire broke out on their ship though they were in site of land the pull of the sinking ship made it almost impossible to escape marrah could hear her mothers cries as her father desperately tried to reach her but despite his skills in casting there was little to be done panicked refugees kept pulling each other under in their own struggles to reach the surface and her mother was soon lost in the chaos for what seemed like an eternity marrah floated there listening to her father scream her mothers name long after the burning ship had disappeared under the water she remained with him as he called for his wife in time a small boat from mardrun appeared and brought them to their new home her father once the pinnacle of syndar stoicism had to be forcibly removed from the water and held down in the boat to keep him from jumping back into the ocean she could feel the change in him almost immediately it was as if something inside of him were dying day by day he grew weaker and weaker as though all of his strength had been tied up to her mother and without her it was gone other syndar could sense it too he stopped casting stopped working and stopped caring at all in no time at all they began to whisper that he was hollowed the whispers then turned to outright contempt her father had not been hollowed they all knew it they had been there when he began to change but instead of helping her find out how to fix the change marrah and her father were expelled from the community the same worthless ungrateful community that had cost her mother her life a year of wondering followed at the end of which they found themselves near new oarsmeet it wasnt a nice place but it was free of syndar looking to run them off so they stayed marrah had grown accustomed to caring for her father she used what little of the hunting skills shed learned at the ruicalithil to catch food when she could or to steal food or money when she had to it was getting harder to care for him though she hated being cast out by the others but she couldnt deny the daytoday horror of being with one who was dead on the inside it wasnt simply that the essence was gone it was as if a black hole had opened inside of him and was desperately sucking the essence warmth and joy out of everything it came near there were times her flesh crawled just being near him she yearned to leave but the moment she resolved to do so the memories of her parents together full of love and happiness prevented her from seeing it through then in 253 on the anniversary of her mothers death marrahs father was gone all he left behind was a barely legible note saying she needs me shes alone marrah stayed in new oarsmeet a several more years in case he returned working on ships doing odd jobs and learning all the things a syndar of her age should never be learning eventually stories of a celestine opposed to traditions and intolerant of classism piqued her interest if not for the tradition of shunning the hollowed she would still be living amongst her own kind most likely a skilled hunter already instead she was in a corrupt and squalid little village doing things that would make her mother weep in order to survive tradition had forced her into the unsavory life she now lived and she could not imagine a world in which one of the most favored of the gods children would actively renounce his position of glory it was an anomaly too unbelievable to be ignored and though she still had several months of promised work left to do on her current ship she felt it was time to seek a new port the minute the ship docked for the evening marrah grabbed the pouch of coins shed been stealing from the others and a small pack then left new oarsmeet for good marrah used her silver to purchase and setup a small shop regarding every patron as an opportunity to find out more about the strange celestine in time her dogged interest and her unconventional skill set caught the attention of the ravens and she was eventually invited to join with them an offer she was more than happy to accept marrahs main place of business is new hope but she has recently begun traveling looking to set up small shops in other towns in order to generate further income and also

and leave people behind she was raised in a very different environment from most others and may not catch jokes or understand their tones and expressions she currently travels with a group of

dissect dead bodies in places where the dead are burned this is obviously somewhat taboo she gets around this by retrieving unclaimed bodies from battlefields and working out in the wilderness where few will see her but even so people tend to think its abnormal corpsecutter was originally a derisive name slapped on her by a dissatisfied patient who claimed she was only good at treating the dead but its been hanging around despite her attempts to dodge it some people might say shes a necromancer or cuts up bodies because she enjoys it while in fact she does not bio background history manetho was born on mardrun but she grew up surrounded by relics of the world that had been lost her tribe was made up of nomadic feral syndar who once roamed the edges of the maykar dominion holding themselves apart from most of its customs but nevertheless feeling a strong connection to the desert and a grudging allrighttheyreheretoowehavetoputupwiththem tolerance for the humans who also lived there but it was a tenuous existence to start with the thirtyfiveyear period of largescale war up until the maykar betrayal didnt help her tribe didnt see the great betrayal coming but they could see that the end was nigh and knew that theyperpetual outsiders at the best of times with no protector and no ability to get onewerent going to fare well in the finale it saddened them but they packed up and left the dry lands exploiting their small numbers to slip through the enemy lines there had to be someplace free of the undead plague  except there wasnt after fleeing from country to devastated country what was left of the tribe eventually took ship for mardrun with the rest of the refugees making the transition from desertdwellers to the forests of their new land was difficult manetho was born into a tribe whose totem animals she had never seen in real life and whose customary clothes were strange even to the few maykar refugees they met still her family was loving enough and many feral syndar had always been isolated from the people around them so being the odd men out was hardly new the tribe traveled in a broad circuit around the colonized lands mostly living by foraging and by trading the goods they made embroidered leatherwork and weavings which fetched decent prices among the people of the colonies and some of the ulven manetho quick enough and strong believed shed grow up to become one of their roving hunters when she was halfgrown the tribe was devastated by sickness it would later be written down in her books as the white plague victims suffered a fever sweats swollen glands and finally virulent white lesions that left thick scarring when if they healed manetho fell ill with most of the others but she had a mild case and survived gaining an immunity to the disease in the process the healthy couldnt get near the sick without risking infection but something had to be done for them so manetho was sent into the quarantine tent to clean and care for them the tribes healers would stand outside the tent and shout instructions leaving manetho to be their surrogate hands inside she performed primitive wound cleansings and tissue excisions as well as preparing poultices and trying to calm the fevered patients by the time the plague was over there wasnt much of a tribe left the exhausted syndar looked at their tiny handful of remaining folk and essentially called it quits the gods were trying to tell them that the tribe was finished and they were going to listen they split up some joined other tribes struck out on their own or went to the towns for work manetho had her own plans watching everyone die had left her with a deep haunting fear of plague and after weeks of nightmares the last remaining shaman told her she had been chosen by an old spirit animal of theirsthe lizard the creature of healing poison and dreams manetho adopted the lizard as her totem and chose a new path for herself she was going to go out into the world and learn as much as she could about healing and if she was lucky she could help other colonists survive the way her tribe couldnt plague was her initial focus but the rising conflicts between the various factions led her to gravitate towards battlefields combat medics were always needed and more importantly there were ample opportunities to learn what the body could and couldnt survive for over ten years manetho drifted lending her growing skills where she could and filling books of notes with her observations on anatomy disease wounds medicines and medical theory battlefields were also the best places to find the dead she needed to practice on ultimately manetho became a skilled healer with somewhat odd mannerisms a good bedside manner a motley collection of tools and practices and a driving need above all to learn shes also isolated from most people even other feral syndar her tribes nostalgia for the old country has made her somewhat derisive on the subject and losing them relatively

story may the gods watch over you no one cares to hear a slaves story but perhaps youre different i believe somewhere theres someone who cares i have to believe otherwise i have nothing my father was my first master he never called me a slave but he hated me my mother died a few days after i was born complications with the labor ive been told father never forgave me for it from that day until the day he sold me he blamed me for my mothers death and he never let me forget it since i was old enough to walk he had me doing everything i could if i didnt do it right or if i didnt accomplish whatever the task was in a timely manner he would lash out at me sometimes he beat me just because he could kirrian my brother was the favorite child he could never do anything wrong he excelled in everything and anything father taught him be it leatherwork hunting fighting or minor spells i was never allowed to learn anything i was too busy cleaning the cottage running errands or doing whatever minor task father could think of kirrian eventually began to pick up fathers habits as well if he deemed i hadnt done the task right he would beat father to my beating and even then father would finish the job one day when i was ten years old father sent me out to the market to find my brother i found him leaning against a tavern wall flirting with one of the tavern maids father sent me to find you he wants to go check the traps i said meekly ill be back when im back my brother snapped of course im sorry to have bothered you i bowed my head and turned to leave i didnt say you could leave yet he turned to the maid watch this he said with a smirk see that man over there he asked me pointing out a man by the fruit stand he has a full coin purse youre small and semismart im sure even you could handle pickpocketing him of course i replied i snuck over and scoped out the situation when i believed i had found the opportune moment i made to take it sneaking closer i slipped my hand in this pocket but just as i was turning to leave he caught me i took off running clutching the purse to my chest my brother watched as i ran toward him laughing all the while this was his fault i knew it so when i reached him i took advantage of another opportunity i threw the purse at my brother and darted down an alley next to the tavern i paused halfway down to catch my breath when i realized that my pursuer had become preoccupied with my brother a shouting match ensued and a crowd gathered around but when i heard the sound of steel being pulled i took off again father then had another death he believed he could blame on me repeatedly he told me that i shouldve been the one to die that day they were after me not him there was absolutely no reason he shouldve died frankly i would rather it had been me who died that day it would have spared me the coming events for about six months after my brothers death the beatings increased thats how my father dealt with the loss come the six months he discovered drinking drowns his sorrows but it also fueled his rage every night he would disappear to some tavern in town and stumble his way back before dawn until the drinking became worse and he just wouldnt make his way back those nights id have to go find him typically he was found in a corner gambling his possessions away that night though he was in his typical corner playing liars dice with a merchant his money was completely gone and he was deep in his cups the merchant had a bemused smile on his face as he knew he was ruining father i snuck up behind him and put my hand on his shoulder father its time to go i whispered in his ear stay out of this you little whore he shouted back and slapped me across the face now now now no need for that the merchant said calmly and gestured for me to sit i stood shocked as he signaled for a tavern maid to bring another round plus one over sit down little one he said with a friendly smile on his face i looked to him and to father confused listen to him wench he grumbled at me i sat on the bench next to father as the tavern maid laid three tankards on the table now we have matters of this debt to discuss the merchant said im an impatient man and will be leaving town in two days i require my payment before then youll get your damn money father grumbled into his cup you have no money left how do you expect to pay it back thats not for you to worry about father snapped ah but it is for its my money now the merchant said his eyes twinkled as a smile crept across his face and he watched me timidly lift the tankard to my lips or ill consider your debt forgiven if if father said suddenly intrigued if you give me her i gasped and dropped the tankard on the table spilling its contents father slapped me across the face again take her shes yours he snapped at the merchant i never loved her a pity such a pretty little thing like her whispered the merchant ill take her and forget your debt fair enough shes yours the merchant stood with a smile on his face and offered me his hand come along sweet one i looked to father to the merchant and back to father you heard the man get along im done with you father snapped i hesitantly took the merchants hand and he led me from the tavern i never looked back and regretted it ever since he led me outside of town where an elaborate camp was set up immediately upon walking in men gathered around to see what he had brought back they started laughing and jeering and my supposed savior gave a small nod of his head two of the men ran off laughing in the direction of what seemed to be a mediocre blacksmithing station this way my dear the merchant said leading me towards the largest tent in the middle of the camp gather round gents and comee meet the newest member of our crew he called out to the camp men came out of tents pulling on shirts or pants or stumbled out of the small feasting tent and gathered in front of the large tent gentleman i am pleased to announce we have a new member joining us he paused and leaned down to whisper uhh what is your name my dear lineth i replied quietly lineth he announced the men cheered and jeered clapping and whooping make way make way called the two men who had run off earlier at the top of their lungs a path cleared as the group parted for the two to approach they stopped in front of the merchant and held something out as they knelt the merchant smiled and grabbed the irons from the men are you afraid he asked me and clapped the irons on my wrist panic rose in me as the cheering grew louder the merchant then grabbed my wrists and dragged me to the side of his tent a large tarp covered what looked like a giant chest two other men pulled it aside to reveal a small cage underneath the gaoler unlocked the cage and i was forced in i rushed back toward the opening just as the door slammed in my face the merchant held the tarp then and said with a smile and you thought life with

birthplace a small town in vandregon faction affiliation the rangers of crows landing bio my family went on the one of the earlier ships across the sea to mardrun when i was very young and i can barely remember faedrun im told we lived in rural vandregon my parents moved there to avoid approaching undead forces as well as provide medical services to returning soldiers to adjust to life around humans they took up a last name to avoid complications as for my shortened name leo is what other children in the town called me as humans have a tendency to shorten the names of others my parents worked as doctors in the new colony as well so i grew up learning and reading about medical sciences the walls of our house were stacked with books on the body and how it works and my father made sure i was well educated in the material since the moment it was first introduced to me i knew i was meant to wield magic im fairly sure a family friend or houseguest doing small tricks was where i first was introduced to the arcane arts it just was so fascinating to me since there was so much still undiscovered about arcane magic my curiosity was too much and soon i was learning from a local mage in my free time my focus was mainly on how to wield it in combat since my parents always pestered me about how dangerous the world was soon enough the basics were second nature to me and i was turning my curiosity towards the lands outside my hometown growing up restricted to the areas around newhope has fueled my curiosity i constantly strive to learn as much as i can about mardrun and wish to travel around during my time growing up i used some extra money i had to buy a map of the southern peninsula it was rough mediocre and contained few details on anywhere outside clan nightriver despite the pathetic beginning the map made me wonder much more about these lands i purchased a few more and soon drew up my own map by combining features of those i had my parents began complaining that i was wandering too far outside the city i decided that as soon as i could i would leave newhope and begin to explore the world laid before me after i was confident enough in my magic i quit my training and left home despite the appeal from my parents that i was being hasty and rash there is much more i can learn from going and experiencing the world than from sitting in a study scouring books and scrolls naturally i knew i needed allies but didnt know where to turn people who were frequent travelers would do nicely so i tried investigating what was called the brotherhood of the long winter unfortunately shortly after i had joined the brotherhood fell out of power and i was back to the road with no home and winter beginning to show itself i have been stripped of most of my money as i spent it in order to get by in the harsh cold since the largest faction has fallen out of power i will turn to what was the second largest the rangers of crows landing they are an accepting group and travel often so i will be able to continue to explore while still having a powerful ally i shall have to see if i feel loyal and committed to their cause but for now at least i am saferphoenix cleric age 82 laertes was born to a wealthy syndar enclave deep in the heart of the kingdom of tielorrien this enclave was heavily involved in the nobility of the ruling queen and traveled quite often within the kingdom in order to do the administrative work laertes was not raised by his biological mother or father and was put into the academic programs offered to his enclave that filled his time with study on history politics and arcane magics laertes hated politics and studies on the arcane from a young age his mind wandered to that of adventure and sword fighting it made him a bit of an outcast amongst his peers since the children of his enclave had standards they were expected to live up to when his friends around him were trying to get high test scores and gain favor amongst the important ranks of the enclave laertes was more concerned about finishing the lesson and being allowed the time to wander about the community and explore this did not mean that laertes was not well educated he took to his lessons on history and lore and soaked in everything he could find he had no interest in proper politics amongst ruling magis syndar but if there was historical research on old syndar cultures or ancient artifacts then he would spend hours upon hours reading and studying this was the life he lived spending countless hours at the great libraries with the more scholarly syndar he began to call his friends his peers continued to look down their nose at him for choosing such things to occupy his time when laertes grew into adulthood his sense of adventure had finally taken hold of him after spending a year gathering supplies he set out on a trip to the southeast corner of tielorrien he was going to wait a few more years but the tests and placement exams of his enclave were fast approaching and it was not the life that laertes wanted to live most of the elders in the enclave would have been outraged at the request to leave because their status amongst the kingdom was highly prized instead of asking for permission laertes slipped out in the dark of night and made haste on his adventure over the next three years laertes made the most of his journey he met many new faces and discussed lore with a number of magis of the communes he took up residence with he constantly had to work or trade to get the food and supplies he needed to keep on traveling there were more than a few nights that were spent outside in a makeshift shelter with an empty stomach when laertes reached the end of the kingdom he decided to continue on and see what he could find he had heard many stories of the syndars interacting with a lesser race one they called the humans he wanted to see what their civilizations were like by pledging a couple weeks worth of work laertes was able to hitch a ride with a trade caravan going to the maykar dominion he had been told that this human kingdom was more accepting of the syndar and that relations with them were much smoother than with the other kingdoms the maykar dominion was also a nation prized on spritual enlightenment and art and it interested laertes greatly it was at this time that the undead plague began on faedrun being on the move through the kingdom the reports that laertes picked up on were scattered and fragmented at best the borders of the kingdom were constantly moving with caravans and soldiers from the syndar nations laertes wanted to know more but there was no way to get more involved in this while passing through the border upon arriving at the maykar dominion laertes was amazed at the level of beauty and spirituality of the oasis capitol of the kingdom the gardens and art of this city rivaled that of some of the most talented artists in tiellorien they also housed an immense library of books which laertes took to studying quickly he was fascinated by the different angles to the lore of the books of humans this is where laertes began to understand the mahsai the maykars spirtual faction that centers around the act of belief and not the subject of belief raised in education on politics and the arcane magics laertes felt that his true calling was one of spirituality after spending another two years at the maykars capitol laertes decided to follow a trade caravan to aldoria the roads had become more dangerous as the war with the undead plague picked up in speed and brutality the friends he had made in saresh told him not to go but laertes wanted to continue his journey he was foolish to think that the war had not reached as far as it did when the penitent forces and undead ambushed the trade caravan laertes finally realized just how bloody war could be dozens of caravan guards and travelers were butchered or dragged into the sand and torn to shreds by the tireless undead horde the basic divine powers he had learned from the maykar clerics could do almost nothing to help him survive the onslaught his combat skills were basic at best and there was only two options left for him run or die laertes ran he ran as fast as he could deep into the sand dunes of the maykar desert without any knowledge of where he was going and with no real supplies it was obvious that he was not going to survive for very long after stumbling around in the desert he succumbed to the heat of the scorching sun and passed out from dehydration when laertes awoke he was in a makeshift cot in a camp of some nomads he was still a bit delusional from his near death experience and wasnt sure what had happened when he stumbled out of the cot he found out that he was in the camp of a nomadic group of syndar they had found him in the desert and saved his life the group was skilled at surviving the desert and moving their trade and wares on the backs of camels laertes stayed with this group as they returned to their home on the edge of the maykar desert laertes had never seen a group of syndar like this before there were plenty of texts and scrolls depicting all sorts of the feral syndar tribes but not much existed on any serous syndar that chose to live on the fringes of civilization like this while most seemed to be of serous bloodlines a few of the phoenix members appeared to have feral qualities as well the group was named the phoenix and they spent most of their time trading and wandering the desert they were not too concerned with the politics of the rest of the syndar and enjoyed the company of humans after spending a few months with them laertes found he was welcome in their group and felt like he had a place he belonged to and could call home he decided not to travel back to tielorrien and return to his previous life laertes took to the customs of the phoenix and brought with him the education and knowledge of researching the libraries of both tielorrien and saresh his time with the clerics of the mahsai taught him how to channel his faith into what mattered the meaningful brush strokes of his inner artist of spirituality he used his faith to revere the phoenix and the sun god of his new people over the years laertes has collected quite a library of tomes and books on different subjects throughout the ages when some of the younger phoenix want to hear stories or ask questions about the other great lands laertes would calmly recite some of the knowledge he retained periodically the proper serous court dialect would slip back into his speech and betray his nonphoenix heritage but it had never been an issue with the rest of the syndar it often became a small joke amongst the younger syndar when he talked funny he misses the chance to read and study and looks forward to every trip into the maykar to visit the great libraries again laertes also took up martial arts as a means to stay healthy and fit defend his people when needed and to channel his inner thoughts and meditations his preferred weapon was the longer naginata a fine weapon that served him well his blade is one of his prized possessions and he can be found spending hours practicing and training with the blade when the discussion amongst his people was to abandon this land and find a new home across the sea laertes was eager to continue the adventure he began so long ago the journey was dangerous and many phoenix perished but laertes skill in the divine kept more than a few from dying due to wounds and disease when laertes survived and stepped foot off the boats onto the new island they were to call home he knew that he had made the right choice to leave his enclave so many years ago once settled on the new island he began to coordinate with the new magis of the phoenix in creating a temple to solara to continue to practice his faith laertes looks forward to teaching the phoenixs faith to the younger syndar and managing his small but impressive library of tomes and scrolls laertes was one of the first volunteers willing to take a boat to the mainland when the settlement of humans was discovered he felt his knowledge and experience could benefit in the phoenix establishing a relationship with the humansplayed by jennifer schneiderman character name gwynevive cotorelle gender female class mage age 24 race syndar hair brown eyes green occupation

cordyn lockwell cody jackson gwynevive was born on fire island during the summer of 242 and had by all accounts an undisrupted a childhood possible for her people from an early age she enjoyed exploring and learning pestering the adults to teach her everything they could about flora fauna and archery she particularly enjoyed cataloging and calling after the birds on the island on her 10th birthday the magis found gwynevive had a knack for arcane magic and began her formal training following her year gwynevive continued to take classes in arcane magic retreating to the forest to practice and occasionally the forge she had become fond of the blacksmith though he was really more of a crude weapon maker with such few resources on the island in return for some assistance with fashioning broken weapons into arrowheads he allowed her to practice her magic in the clearing behind his forge accidentally setting fire to a table on an early attempt of a push spell at school had put her on a kind of blacklist outside of the classroom he taught her to conserve all available resources something she took to heart from saving the metal shavings from the workshop floor to create jewelry to conserving her mana until it was truly needed gwynevive continued to create and learn but when first contact was made with the humans in 261 she felt as though the world she had come to know was turned on its head everything she had heard from her parents and the elders had been confirmed other races other people were out there she felt as though the entire world had become so much larger and she was so much smaller in comparison when the first traders announced they would come to the island she rushed to the scene in as dignified a manner as possible the humans seemed gruff and loud to her but she didnt care she had brought with her some of her arrow heads and jewelry that the blacksmith had deemed appropriate enough quality of course her being so young it was far from the most elegant work there the humans seemed more interested in the cloth bows and arrows of some of the older more experienced syndar than her not to be discouraged she set her wares on a woven mat and began to absentmindedly whittle before being interrupted by one of the humans what have you got there gwynevive looked up at the salty and leatheryskinned human above her completely unable to speak how dare he address her in such a direct and rude manner he smiled down at her you make that yourself why was he smiling at her like that it was such a big smile she could see all his teeth he looked ridiculous unable to tell if he was making fun of her or not gwynevives eyes widened whether out of anger or astonishment she couldnt rightfully say she tried to speak but something inside her vocal cords wasnt working all she could muster was a nod she turned back to the piece of wood in her hands while the human furrowed his brow and shifted from foot to foot he knelt down to get a better look gwynevive noticed that he had already purchased a few bows and mats from the other syndar and pushed down the indignation she felt he was humoring her my wife might like this is it for sale the man asked picking up a small ring with a branch etched around the outside gwynevive looked at the man and nodded a second time the man rifled through a bag on his hip and pulled out a small bar of iron gwynevive tried her best to contain her excitement though clearly she had let something show the man showed her his toothy smile again and extended the iron to her why dont you make me some more and ill come back for them gwynevive looked back and forth from the mans face to the iron trying to gauge him her mind was racing she held her hand aloft and slowly nodded a third time the mans name gwynevive later learned was jermaine cotorelle and he lived at crows landing over the next two years he would come on nearly every other trade shipment to fire island always making sure to stop by gwynevives mat before the end of his stay initially he had taken some getting used to but over time she had learned to accept his rough and tumble mannerisms he liked touching the other humans she noticed often slapping them and guffawing loudly when he came to see her he would do most of the talking telling her about crows landing and his new exploits on the mainland she learned about ulven and mordoc and heard tales of a multitude of races living together jermaine always brought small payments for her work a makers fee as it were but more importantly the new iron that came with him was far superior to what she had to work with on the island all in all she grew to look forward to his visits and began sharing her stories with him of her childhood even showing him some simple magic when he asked as her work got better he started bringing more payments and larger bars of iron she asked if it was a hassle to travel with such heavy cargo to which he shrugged and told her not to worry after two years of trade gwynevive struck a second bargain with jermaine in exchange for her work and protection room and board and safe passage to the mainland something weighed heavy on gwynevives mind though she couldnt place it it was the fall of 265 and she feltitchy it was nearing on winter and though she had been in crows landing for two years the winters still seemed harsher here than fire island she paced the town trying to find words to explain how she felt but not getting anywhere hunting didnt help neither did practicing her magic or making jewelry everything only served to frustrate her more by the time she caught up with jermaine and his wife freya it was so obvious something was bothering her she was worried he might notice something on your mind vive she wrinkled her nose at the nickname he had given her by now she had hoped that he would call her by her real name either that or she thought she would have grown used to it the syndar usually prefer to be called by their full names jermaine she tried her best to contain her irritations humans prefer to shake hands but i never bothered you about that did i you tried to reach for my hand this morning jermaine gave her a smirk as freya brought dinner out to the table gwynevive had been living and working with them since she left fire island she had grown fond of them both they made her feel more at home on the mainland despite not fully understanding her culture the first time they startled her during a full moon sacrifice of incense she was so angry with freya she nearly brought her to tears overall she had a good life here jermaine brought her on his routes for company and protection at home she would make more metal goods to sell and she had recently adopted their last name to be more recognizable outside of crows landing truth be told that was only half the reason she was very fond of her adopted family but something was different now she had been all over the southern routes and back to the island time and time again she wanted a change of pace she eyed the warm meal in front of her jermaine ive wanted to ask you how you felt about the idea of leaving were off north next week just waiting on supplies alone freya stopped eating and looked to her husband jermaine was silent gwynevive kept staring at her food hah about time i was wondering when this life would be too small for youid justfeel better if you didnt go alone gwynevive couldnt help but crack a smile before long gwynevive met cordyn lockwell a human with a sword and an interest in arcane magic she wasnt sure

he and got along with them very well his father was a brave warrior and he wished to be just like him falltyr fell in one of the final battles against the humans of faedrun when fallyn was still young by syndar standards he was devastated by this loss when peace returned to faedrun aerllyn took her cubs down out of the mountains to live with relatives near a human encampment hoping her children would not harbor resentment for the death of their father though fallyn forgave the humans his younger brother aeryth did not he became bitter and often tried to run away but fallyn always went after him and brought him home fallyn trained in the ways of his clan archery he became very adept at using a bow and was quite skilled though had problems with further targets as he got older he provided for his family by hunting and trading for them the humans of the nearby town even learned to accept him as one of their own as he would share his spoils when plentiful he even helped lead worship ceremonies for lunara the goddess of the moon the lodestone family ignored the ghost stories beginning to sweep through faedrun and simply continued to live their lives one night though the oldest daughter lythia was attacked by an unknown assailant though her wounds seemed superficial they quickly became infected and she passed one stormy night fallyn had to bury her the syndar comforted each other and everything became quiet afterwards fallyn even met a female syndar from one of the other families in their clan who left the mountains with them and they fell in love one night while getting

syndar rushed back to their mother and last sister and broke the news within the next few days more and more undead began to pour into the nearby towns fallyn was called to fight alongside his clansmen and the human soldiers to fight back this plague of horrid creatures though his brother rell tried to join them he was too young and aerllyn kept her youngest boy to keep her and fissi safe fallyns outpost had become overrun with undead and many of his comradesinarms were killed or abducted but still he fought his arms burned but as long as he had arrows he would not stop during a siege screams outside the walls were heard which drew the hordes away fallyns keen eyesight could see his lovemate being carried off by a group of zombies she had only come to bring him a care package from his family his fellow warriors had to keep fallyn from going after her and soon her screams for him faded into the night though his did not cease for days though word was delivered often about other settlements being attacked the undead did not visit the camp again fallyn was called to the gates one morning to meet his mother  siblings they had gotten news of a mass exodus to another continent to the east while other syndar returned to the mountains fallyn bid his friends goodbye and joined his family on a ship to mardrun they arrived to a new colony being formed it was called newhope not long after settling into their new home news came of a race of bestial barbarians calling themselves the ulven attacking colonists who ventured too far outside newhope for food or water they rarely left survivors and the wounds they inflicted were always so severe that those did not last long anyways though fallyn made sure his kin stayed within the town limits aerllyn was strongwilled and had centuries more experience than her cub one day she went out to the fields to pick grains with some of the other human  syndar women of the colony but none of them returned home upon learning this fallyn rushed out to her bow in hand but he was too late he stumbled across the ulven finishing off the last of their kill enraged he fired arrows into the crowd but he missed one the sole survivor rushed him slashing his left eye fallyn buckled over in pain and the barbarian kneed him in the face his spiked kneeguard puncturing the syndars right cheek and knocking him to the ground soon the ulven was on top of him blade at his throat fallyn managed to stop it from going in too far and pushed his attacker up off him unfortunately the ulven used this opportunity to bite fallyns right middle finger off despite the pain almost blinding him he pulled his side dagger out of his belt and slit the tribesmans throat the syndar stumbled over to his mothers corpse and cradled it for hours distraught that he had failed to protect her and ashamed that the loss of his eye and finger meant that he could never fire a bow again he exiled himself from newhope his clansmen and his younger siblings leaving them in the care of their fellow syndar he wandered into the wilderness of mordrun and disappearred for months newhope developed a truce with the ulven their ancient enemy the mordok began to resurface and contact with faedrun dried up broken angry untrusting and faithless fallyn returns to the growing colony though scarred and even tattooed now rell and fissi welcome him back

halfsyndar class mage bio everything changed for her when her father died on faedrun she had been alive for 100 years and traveled with her father everywhere one might think it odd to be with your father for that long  doublyso when one considered his human nature  but it only seemed natural when you were a 12 year old girl for those 100 years elensul thought herself immortal giving herself a unique perspective about the world she has lived so long that things that would bother most people do not seem to faze her the years had left her with a very open personality trusting and willing to hold judgment for a time that seemed oddly inappropriate for one of her apparent age elensul is a daughter split between two worlds  her father human her mother syndar and her feet remained planted between these worlds her father is a human named rovenon amenti she never knew her mother having been told that she died during childbirth what her father never told her was that her mother the syndar mage nenvira trisfal was still alive and the reason for her  and her fathers  somewhat unique curse she was cursed with what she saw as immortality for her father had never clearly explained beyond so long as i remain alive so shall you her aging was slowed to the point it seemed to defy nature  her mind and attitudes felt the greatest of this curse keeping her attitudes naive and childlike despite her years it does not seem like such a bad curse but when one been 12 years old for 100 some years it starts to make a difference one consequence of this curse was her fathers slowed aging mirrored her own  but seeing as the life of a human is a wilting leaf in contrast to the evergreen span of a syndar they both knew it would end they spent their time traveling through faedrun looking for a way to break the curse but they could not find a way to do so without him dying in the end they finally accomplished their goal in the worst way elensul was returned to the main currents in the rivers of time but was alone in the world for the first time in her life the next 10 years were rough for her as a child she had always had an innate ability for magic but as a childs hands have difficulty lifting a blade so too can they never channel the forces of magic with the skill of a older wiser mage as she grew older her spells began to grow more potent and dangerous sometimes she would lose control over her powers and harm those around her with her odd appearance and speech she was often branded a danger to towns and villages forced to travel to avoid persecution eventually she grew into a woman who could travel around without being treated like a little girl this is when she decided she wanted to get away from a place where she was reminded constantly of her father  her travels had led them everywhere in search of answers and with the growing threat of the undead she sought an escape from a dangerous land the refugees spoke of a land that none had explored  free from the memories she had formed over the hills and trees and faedrun her mind made up she got on a ship to travel to mardrun and never looked back she still remains a bit childish today even though she is a grown woman  years of habit and the lingering effects of the magic on her mind make retreat to childish emotions easier she is playful and excited about the world but maintains a sense of wisdom and detachment when not eagerly exploring the new sensations surronding her people who meet her see that she has an innocence about her that makes her seem less threatening she may be a bit nave when it comes to meeting new people but like a child she can tell if someone seems off sometimes she forgets that she is mortal and may do some reckless things which may endanger those around her she is very curious about the world learning new things about people and the world have always fascinated her she finds mardrun an intriguing place and the people in it even more so the intricate culture of the ulven puzzles her but she is more curious about their customer than appalled one thing that she would hope to find out in the future is who put the curse on her in the first place she has traveled most of faedrun and has not figured it out she doubts that there will be answers on mardrun but one never know where the answers may be hiddenplayed by brandon potter name edrahil gender male age 34

what i thought was the world at the time i had no idea growing up that the reason we only visited human villages and settlements was because my parents were wanted by the syndar community it was a dream to play outside for hours meeting new people every month or so depending on how long my parents decided to stay in one place my mother was a healer and my father a merchant i remember this one time when i was twelve i was playing with these two girls who had ears like mine which ive never played with anyone like that before they seemed so elegant even though they were dressed the same as me they liked to play puzzle games which i love playing the following day on a walk with my parents we ran into the girls and their parents and found out that they were ambassadors from a royal syndar family that was the first time i had learned the truth of what had happened to make us outlaws of the syndar community we immediately ran back to our little home packed up everything and left as soon as possible my mother had told me that she had fallen in love with the wrong person and now they wanted her dead shortly after that we heard news of the undead spreading throughout faedrun we started traveling towards the ocean where these ships would be to take us to a new land free of undead we waited many months to be able to board a boat finally one had enough room for us we had to sell everything since there was no room on the boat for it all a few weeks into the trip i found these two boys who let me play with them we became fast friends elijah was the nicest person there i will admit that i had a massive crush on him but never showed it the three of us were inseparable for the rest of the trip but all good things must come to an end at least thats how it has always been for me and i had to go with my parents while they went on with their lives a few days after we landed in the new world my parents went to try and find us safe ride to a nearby village to find work they had been gone all day and told me to stay in the room we were renting it was boring waiting for them to return when it got dark outside i decided to go down to the docks for a walk i laid down in the sand to look up at the night sky a few minutes later the dark night turned red red lights in the sky all around then shouting and people fighting everywhere there was more of the invaders than guards fighting them off the battle did not last very long i was frozen in fright and couldnt move only watch i didnt understand anything that was happening around me especially when two men grabbed me they tied my hands behind my back and gagged me tried as much as i could to break free but couldnt they pretty much just carried me back to their small boat tying me to one of the wooden seats and put a bag over my head i waited for anyone to come save me but no one did the boat was loaded with crates and more men before leaving shore i heard shouting in the distance that was steadily getting louder shortly they were hauling me up a ladder and onto the deck orders were given to take me down to the hold with the other slaves i was dropped on the floor before the bag was removed from my head i looked around there were three boys with me in front of this big man with years of stains on his shirt and pants he assigned the boys to scrubbing the floors i got the job of cleaning dishes clothes or anything else they wanted clean over the years i was promoted to different positions each giving me more freedom on the ship eventually able to go ashore with the men one night the captain decided to get really drunk with the help of his first mate long after the bar was closed the crew was making their way back to the ship i saw the first mate leading the captain down a dark alley away from the docks having not felt like drinking i followed the two of them i stayed in the shadows thats when i saw the first mate pull a sword on the captain but he was too drunk to realize what was happening i quickly ran up and used a flare spell to knock him away he dropped his sword in his drunkenness that i picked it up and stabbed him in the heart with it the captain saw what i did for him and promoted me on the spot to be his new first mate when we got back to the ship the captain made an announcement if any of you fuckers try to kill me again ill have you walk the plank he started to walk away then turned back oh yeah that bitch is my new first mate i only held that title for two years before i wanted out and the only way off his ship was the plank i tried to think of a cunning way to make it the captains idea to let me go one night i came up with a game of strength if i won he had to let me go if he won i would stay and be his slave in bed this was one game i refused to loose but in the end i won and won back my freedom i had lost 8 years on that forsaken ship the first thing i did was try and find elijah eventually i did find him but he had a wife and was happy i spent a few nights catching up on old times but he had a life to get back to i moved on trying to find work i tried to find out what had happened to my parents but no one had ever heard of them years later elijah has requested my assistance in a faction called the crimson shades emporium and here i amceleste was born in the year 228 in a canvas tent in the maykar desert she was part of the phoenix commune at the age of 2 it became evident that she was not like the rest of the small children something was off about her she did not play like normal children of the phoneix when she did her bones would pop out of joint she was quite fragile and would get injured doing even the simplest of tasks her parents hoped she would grow out of it but when she was four and things did not improve her parents took her to the magis for help magis yara stated that the celeste would not be able to fight like normal because of her rare condition but with a little help she would be able to train with the other magis she could start at the age of 5 which is 5 years sooner than the normal age of 10 for all other phoenix to be tested for magic as her parents discussed the possibilities for their daughter they were told of an impending doom to their people the undead were coming and that solaris told them of a place free from the undead the new land was very far away from home but wanting a future for their daughter they decided to make the trip packing only the necessities they packed up their camel and started the trip with their friends and family the journey was not a pleasant one they ran into bandits and soldiers refusing to let the phoenix pass or demanding a fee one dark night in aldoria celestes father was off gathering plants for food when he was found by a group of bandits out numbered and terrified he knew he wont be able to fight so he yelled for help while trying to stave off the bandits a nearby clan member was hunting and heard his cries he came from the woods and helped to chase off the bandits owing his life to this man they became close friends celestes dad invited him and his family to join him for supper they had a son the same age as celeste named thorn celeste and thorn quickly became great playmates and close friends after crossing thru aldoria they came upon the sea knowing nothing of the sea the phoenix had troubles finding anyone to help them cross after camping outside of the port eventually yara came to find sailor who was willing to take them to the promised land that solaris told them about for a hefty fee because of the size of the group they needed two boats so the phoenix pulled together and sold everything that could be sold for food and to pay for the boats with the need to take two boats the phoenix people were separated into two groups one group was with the captain and the other one was led by stronger members who were quickly trained to control the ship for basic sailing the two boats there were able to attain were small so when the day came to set sail the phoenix were divided into two groups celeste and her family were to be boarded on the ship controlled by the captain when she noticed thorn standing in line to board the second ship not wanting to be away from her closest friend she begged her parents to let him on the ship because of the lack of space they would not allow the family of three to change ships his parents arranged it so thorn could change ships to be with celeste and they would stay on the other one after weeks of travel the winds turned and a storm set their boat off course after battling the winds for days celestes boat was sent south off the original course and they lost sight of the other boat the boat containing thorns parents as they resumed their course to the east not sure if they were going the way solarus intended magis yara took ill the strongest healer and second in command yelse was on the second ship the healers tried in vain to help yara but it was not going well as the magis yara was dying she informed celeste and her parents that she needs to train at the age of five under the soon to be new magis raina after a time land was spotted and the phoenix were shown their promised land the new island was wonderful and full of lush woodlands celeste and her family built a home in the trees so they could be closer to solaras as the island started to take shape celeste was brought to a newly built temple with raina to train as one of the new magis all magis need a guard to protect them and the choice was clear for celeste she wanted thorn to be her guard thorn was younger then they usually started to train raina thought about this thorn no longer has parents and needs to be cared for after a time she conceded that thorn could be her guard as the years went by thorn trained to be a suitable bodyguard for the young magis and celeste continued her training thorn grew quite fond of celeste and after they turned 18 he started to court her it did not take long before she was returning his affections after several years celeste told her parents she wanted to be joined with thorn with their blessing they had a ceremony to be joined a tradition that is not taken lightly in the phoenix culture it was a big celebration as time went on a couple of phoenix noticed a boat and raina decided to send a welcome group to meet the new people and possibly new land anariel and laertes were chosen as they were level headed and easy to talk to they were also skilled fighters in magic and naginata next chosen was celeste because she was becoming a great skilled healer and would be able to assist the group well with celeste came her partner thorn who was swore to protect her with his life with a brief prayer for the group and good byes from her parents they were sent off to meet the new people who would change her whole life againplayed by ian loebl character name cassander xanthopoulos gender male class rogue age 100 race

member of the phoenix rumors bio for my part gentlemen ive been places seen things and had quite an interesting life over my hundred years in this world i started from roots more humble than most being a feral syndar with no parents but over time i overcame most of what stood before me with the exception of my unchanging race from what i was able to discover i was born in the kingdom of fawyth but i have not discovered the identities of my parents i do however know why they gave me to the orphanage in the kingdom of tielorrien where i grew up i was born feral but even worse than that i was born albino with snow white skin and hair and pale eyes a doubly cursed child as i grew i was able to find some who accepted me but as a whole i was looked down upon as being a lesser being by other syndar when i was thirteen i was taken from the orphanage to become the servant of a wealthy and influential syndar merchant who i would serve for seven years he was important enough to be able to trade with the nara pentare something claimed by an incredibly small quantity of people i learned a great deal from him by observing every aspect of his business dealings though he only taught me personally what i needed to know in order to serve him properly over those seven years i was nothing if not loyal however my master did not treat me as an equal and i received no gratitude for my service this perhaps showed through the most on a cold fall night in my seventh year of service my master had drunk far too much during the day and had fallen ill inconsiderate of the fact that we had an important meeting to attend that night which stood to create a profit of hundreds of vandregonian silver in addition this meeting was a rare and dangerous one because we were to meet with representatives of the empire of the nara pentare a rigid and honorbound culture to say the least if we were to fail in attendance we would likely never be able to trade with them again as he was unable to even get up from his bed i went to the meeting in his place taking his name without his permission initially our contact was extremely hesitant to deal with me because he was mistrustful of feral syndar as he had been prejudiced against them by other syndar in the past however i used what i had learned to great effect and the deal we were to make went through making an even greater profit than we had calculated when i returned my master furiously interrogated me about what had happened he did not care about the astronomical sum that he had just acquired he only cared that i had stolen his identity however temporary it might have been that night he beat me wildly with a stick and the next day was when i left his service disgusted by his treatment for the last time thus began my wandering as i traveled from human kingdom to human kingdom using my skills at selling and identifying to survive eventually i decided to settle down in the maykar dominion where there were many humans rich and poor who needed my services the high level of tolerance exhibited by the maykar was also a boon to my efforts my contacts and friends from my years of traveling served me well and i was well known for my ability to find almost any item in the world upon request i sold items for temples lords other merchants and artisans alike and through this became successful and affluent though not as much as i might have liked however all good things must come to an end the rapid sweep of the undead through the north of the continent made me decide to leave the dominion a decision which proved wise as they defected to the penitent shortly thereafter i was able to easily reestablish myself in southern aldoria and continue as before but it was the beginning of the final end of everything as soon as i heard of the discovery of mardrun and that a colony had been founded i departed on the first ship that i could purchase a cabin on when i reached mardrun i found myself back where i had started i was alone in a foreign land with none of my old contacts to guide me or help me therefore i began again i spent time first in new aldoria getting to know the populace while i waited for the conflict with the native ulven to subside after it had i made the rounds of every colony even the small upandcoming ones like crows landing and keys crossing i lived by doing accounting and numberwork for a wide range of people in all the colonies but my main work was in new aldoria and newhope the two most prosperous settlements i eventually became a merchant again in my own right and sought an organization that could help me make better use of my talent the phoenix seemed a natural choice it was not a smooth transition but it has seemed to work out well so far with luck my prosperity will continue to increase and all shall see that regardless of race regardless of the curses of our birth we may become successful and tolerated though our own effortplayed by nate

trusting lighthearted around friends a bit gullible relationships travels with marcus clearbrook the sun slowly rose into the sky over new hope promising another warm spring day brodin fizzelwick was already in the mists of setting up his small stall at the town square with spring breaking the cold fist of winter everyone was happy although there was a lot to do and everyone did what they could to get a jump on the growing season food was in short supply and everyone was feeling the pinch however spring promised a new beginning and everyone had a smile on their face despite the constant struggle brodin finished placing his last show piece when he noticed that a few children were running to and fro in the square he turned his head to the right and saw another early riser busy setting up her shop no more than two stalls down from his stand from what he could deduce she was seamstress laying out many new tunics and trousers she carefully folded every piece of clothing like they were very dear to her that was a sign of a good craftsman she herself was very beautiful with long straight walnut hair fine angular features trim confident and syndar this one is pretty can i have it said a voice out of brodins vision turning his head he saw no one then he looked down and saw a little girl probably around 10 or 11 years of age she had piercing blue eyes and was dressed in a simple brown tunic and hose with a large cloth hat on her head she pointed a dirty little finger at a silver turtle broach that had green jeweled eyes it was one of his most recent pieces and one that he was very proud of he was hoping he could get a decent amount of coin for it if anything it would show his skill and possibly entice someone to ask about commissioning a custom piece you have a very good eye that is one of my favorite pieces it took me a long time to make and i was hoping to make a good profit on it do you or your parents have a means to buy it brodin said not wishing to turn away anyone despite their age plus it was early and the square was still mostly empty only a few other tradesmen started filing into the square i dont have much money sir winter was hard and all of my mothers money went to buying food and linen the little girl said as she cast her eyes down to the cobblestone feeling slightly sorry for the girl but only slightly everyone was struggling and brodin wasnt going to get back to his island home without money what is your name he asked arie she said sheepishly maybe he could get some information from this youth they see many things are a more willing to give up information if you dangle the metaphorical carrot in front of their face well arie i have a deal for you i am new to town and am looking to find a few things if you can help me find these things i will sell the broach to you for a big discount aries eyes widen and then she looked to her left and bit her lower lip ok but can i ask you a question after you ask me a question cocking an eyebrow brodin realized this youth was both perceptive and inquisitive agree i will go first would you happen to know when the next ship is to leave arie furrowed her brow and thought for a moment my friend gregory whose father told him that many of the fishermen and captains are afraid to sail because of a ghost ship in the fog so i dont know for sure this news was distressful to brodin with every captain afraid to set sail that means he is going to find very few captains brave enough to go and if he does find one they are going to charge an exurbanite amount of money ok my turn arie said as she smiled and jumped up and down eagerly where are you from do you have a family are you planning on staying in new hope brodin was slightly taken aback at the questions but it couldnt hurt the questions seemed innocent enough i was born in the maykar dominion on faedrun which is really far away my father was a candle maker and my mother was a silversmith my father was killed by bandits as we left our village to find a ship to leave faedrun my mother passed away on the ship to mardrun i felt very alone at first but the enclave made me feel like i still had a family i set up my home and shop on the island to the south of mardrun as to whether or not i am staying in new hope im not sure for how long i am a on a quest for the phoenix i am trying to gather supplies and information and then i guess we will see he said as images of his past came flying back many good some not so good the early death of his parents ever fresh in his mind he misses them so brodin took a deep breath and pushed the painful memories aside and looked back at his youthful customer arie smiled and giggled as if brodin said something silly then without another word she ran down the rows of stalls and through a growing number of people brodin shrugged it off as a lady in a red dress approached to browse his goods the morning and day progressed brodin was able to sell a few items to a couple passing customers he also was commissioned by a wealthy merchant to craft an ornate belt loop the sun started its slow crawl into the western horizon when he decided to close up shop and find his companion marcus hello again said a very familiar voice behind him he turned to see arie standing there smiling holding the hand of the seamstress he noticed earlier the beautiful seamstress smiled and said siala kay nu i hope my daughter here wasnt bothering you earlier im myra silvertongue what is your name brodin stood there dumbfounded for a second this beautiful syndar lady stood before him and talked like a common human he guessed that she was half syndar like himself his mother insisted that he learn how to speak like a proper syndar and retain as much of his syndar heritage as possible he however realized that it is essential to learn how to speak with human and syndar alike it helps with business he was also chastising himself for not noticing that arie was her daughter looking at the youth more he noticed that her features are fine like her mothers but her piercing blue eyes must be her fathers siala kay nu myra it is a pleasure to meet you i am brodin fizzelwick your daughter was not a bother this morning it was actually pleasant to talk to her he said as he slightly bowed that is what she tells me she said as she looks down at her daughter fondly briefly before returning his gaze she also told me a bunch about you as well also that you made a deal for a broach that she was interested in may i see it again he was slightly taken aback she must have sent her daughter to learn what she could about the silversmith this is the first time that a beautiful woman has taken an interest in him he admired her forwardness and she also sounded sincere of course brodin said as the rummaged through his pack to find the jeweled turtle finding it he handed it to her myras green eyes slightly widened at the beauty of the piece how much are you thinking selling it for myra asked hesitantly feeling bold and he knew that she probably didnt have the money to pay for such a nice piece i was hoping for 5 silver coins but i will also trade it to you for a new tunic and sharing a meal with me how does that sound i would really enjoy tha she started saying brodin you thin bastard i have big news i have a way for us to head out of new hope tomorrow marcus came running up and stopped as soon as he saw myra excuse me i didnt know you were talking with such a pretty lady myra put down the broach and looked down i didnt know you were leaving so soon it was nice meeting you she turned and started walking away wait brodin called after her as he grabbed the broach and hurried around the front of this stall he caught up with myra and her daughter a few paces away wait myra yes it is true that i have a need to be away i have a task that i must complete with the phoenix please take this he said as he gave her the broach i cant take it i dont have the money she said feeling slightly ashamed please take it and it comes with a promise that i will be back he said sincerely she looked in his eyes and saw that he was telling the truth i will hold you to that brodin fizzelwick a handful of heartbeats later she broke his gaze and reached in her bag it still gets cold at night take this she produced a new crimson tunic from her bag the tunic felt heavy but also very soft in his hand he looked at her eyes again to see that she had tears in her eyes thank you i will cherish this gift and remember you every time i wear it take care of yourself and come back safe she said with a smile then she turned and walked away slowly disappearing in the dwindling crowd turning around he strode back to gather his pack in his stall marcus leaning against the support of the stall his eyes alight with excitement alright you son of whore what has you all a flutter brodin said rather annoyed with his human companion grab your gear and lets head back to our room and i will tell you all about it lets just say that i found my calling and i am sure you will approve marcus said with enthusiasm he then proceeded to talk about all the things they will need for the road brodin was only half listening as they walked down the street with the setting sun at their back he managed a brief glance down the road that myra and her daughter left made a quick prayer to solar for his protection and continued down the road with his friend toward a new adventureplayed by lex hokata character name azureal anubias talonflame gender male class mage age 125 born 140 race feral

streaks after my eleventh birthday my mother left me to go adventure the world around her she was never given this opportunity as she had studied other areas of magic she was also unfit to be shaman as she had a reputation of being power hungry the current shaman saw potential in me he was also my godfather and he took care of me when my mother could not he knew my mother was a powerful spellcaster so there should have been no reason i couldnt access the magical arts he quickly enrolled me in shaman training and in his spare time he taught me a few things personally in my training i was picked on by most of my classmates i had not yet unlocked the potential to physically utilize magic while everyone was slinging spells or talking with spirits i was in the corner fumbling with the limited mana i could store as i eventually got stronger at manifesting magic however i realized everyone else had surpassed me one of the other students nicolas came to me and wanted to help me nicolas and i became best friends over time but i still wasnt strong enough to fully manifest my magic nicolas actually became more of a bodyguard for me as he defended me when someone wanted to bully me he was nice but i was arrogant and didnt need his help so i trained with a sword to better protect myself i met a feral syndar female who introduced herself as alana and we hit it off nicely we really bonded over the fact that because the feral syndar are first born we should be at the top of the hierarchy it was around this time my group had completed our basic magical training and learned all we could about being a shaman i was picked as one of the leaders in training as was nicolas there were ten of us and each one had the potential to be the next shaman of wolfgang i knew how to pursue it right after graduation i married alana and had a child with her and named the baby girl naxala we were then sent off to learn about the world around us for a number of years the shaman somehow managed to secure an education for me within the kingdom of fawyth for a while so i was without my wife for and daughter for a number of years my wife wrote to me often to tell me the details of what was going on in the commune my wifes letters started to show up less often so i was getting worried i was learning a great deal in fawyth building small mechanics and timepieces and selling them i wasnt as good as my mentor he had taken a shine to me as i was interested in combining magic and machine i was still worried about my wife and daughter so i wrote often to make sure they were well a few years later i had gotten a terrifying letter from my daughter stating that i need to come back as soon as possible as the current shaman was dying and they will be holding some sort of trial for whom will be the next shaman i had learned a lot in fawyth and i believe that an election would be better for this purpose all the shamans that were sent out got the same letter later that year but i got mine first thanks to my daughter being close with the current shaman i arrived into the commune later that year so i could mingle with the people i was feeding them the idea that i would be the best candidate and i gave each person a small mechanical trinket they were all amused by the item i visited the shaman and he did look unwell he looked sickly and i wasnt sure what caused it i then visited my wife and daughter and they were happy that i was back i gave them a cool gift as well later in the year the other shamans in training came some looked tired others looked pretty happy nicolas however looked terrifying he got bigger and more intimidating the current shaman finally died a year later and thanks to my involvement he had told us to host an election instead of a ritual trial to see who would become shaman some of the candidates disagreed with this but didnt argue with the decision nicolas did not like this at all so he cursed under his breath and walked away i had left the commune for a while to think of a speech i also went to fawyth to go purchase some blueprints for a ship and a few books about sailing so i can teach the commune what i know i had taken naxala with me on this endeavor so i can show her how beautiful fawyth was she enjoyed our trip and she actually took an interest to sailing we came back from our trip to realize that 2 members of the election were murdered the commune was in a panic and some of the other candidates tried to calm the people down i wouldve tried too but naxala and alana urged me to stay home i did as i was told as i was the weakest of the candidates and i did not have an itching to die i began building a small hut to house myself for protection a few months later the 3 candidates that tried to help diffuse the situation earlier also died there were only 5 of us left now so i had sent out a letter to a friend in fawyth to help me out i had also written a few letters to some of my master craftsmen friends to start working on a ship i moved myself to my small hut that i built nobody knew this existed except for me and naxala my contact in fawyth knows as well now a month went by and my contact showed up to not only protect me but to rally the people on my side i had received a letter telling me that i needed to to run away from this commune and start a new tribe i did contemplate this as i had a ship that i was working on and i could take refuge in fawyth if i needed sadly i stayed because i wanted to play the hero and i believed i could handle this threat i also assumed that nicolas would take care of this as well a month later the other 3 candidates had been murdered however the killer had been sloppy and revealed that he was the killer the killer was nicolas and he had demanded loyalty from the commune or they would suffer the same fate he then began to torch my house with alana still inside he pulled her out and tied her up he began to scream my name and i wouldnt budge as i didnt know this was happening until there was a search for me and someone stumbled upon my hut he told me what was going on and i rushed to the scene nicolas threatened me that i have until next year to leave or my wife will die he took her captive and left some members of the commune began to run away others stayed as they saw my guard was strong and bulky and had a big sword it looked like some members believed in me because of my mom the few that were left all looked to me for guidance i recited the speech i had written talking about change and sailing the seas i also talked about loyalty and building a home for us all i talked about the threat at hand and that i would personally deal with this i tried to look confident so the commune was at ease but really i was very nervous i cant fight nicolas hes much too strong now a few months later nicolas reemerged with my wife and he saw that some members of the commune were still left and they were all on my side so you didnt leave he said alana will suffer as he was about to strike her down naxala came from behind him and hit him in the head it didnt do much he grabbed naxalas throat and slammed her to the ground the distraction bought my friend enough time to rush in and disarm nicolas as alana managed to run away however that wasnt enough so nicolas used his magic to toss both my friend and naxala away and he proceed to produce a devastating black magic ball and launched it at me alana quickly rushed in and stepped in front of the blast hugging me she was dying in my arms and the commune was in shock looks like i missed he chuckled i had enough in my anger i attacked him my contact joining me in the fray as the other villagers stood back and watched the fight unfold nicolas slung a few spells at my contact and i was prepared to fight alone to both of our surprise however the spells simply dispersed around a shimmering blue aura i hadnt noticed before protecting my friend from harm we closed with nicolas but my old rical had a few tricks up his sleeve throwing us both back with his spells before conjuring yet another black orb this one found its way into my contacts torso and with no more magical protection he collapsed nicolas was nearly spent now and i seized my chance to close with him relying on my skill with a blade to win out blow after blow struck him until he finally fell at my feet i turned to smile at naxala when i saw the color drain from her face i heard the crackling of arcane energy behind me a moment too late as i turned i saw nicolas rise one final time a last ditch effort to win manifested in the form of another death bolt in his hand i tried to dodge but his aim was true my shoulder took the bolt as we both collapsed to my fortune naxala was there to stop my bleeding as she began to tend to my most grievous wound i had survived the day if only just though nicolas had succumbed to his wounds i was the last remaining candidate to be the shaman so despite the brutal means of attaining the rank there i was i had told my tribe that i was building a ship and that we need to start anew somewhere else at sea my tribe was wary about me being shaman but since i had a means to get silver they followed me to fawyth to be honest i didnt feel that i even qualify to be an actual shaman but according to the shaman code it doesnt matter how many people are in my tribe to qualify as an official shaman so i took my small tribe of 30 people to the coast near fawyth where my ship was being built i had then written a few letters to some of my sailing buddies and asked if they wanted to command my ship a few years later i got word that my ship was finished to my exact specifications in my blueprints and my tribe and i traveled to the coast to examine it it was massive i named the ship alana after my wife and we began to set sail some of my tribe stayed behind in fawyth to study and some of my tribe stayed with the ship builders i had hired some crew to sail my ship and teach my tribe how to sail my tribe was quite small now about 15 of us were left and we set sail to a new land over the years we took turns throughout buying and selling wares we also learned a thing or two about sailing and being on a boat a few humans offered to come aboard and help we let them on as the more hands the better we stopped at a different port town infested with both humans and serous syndar we again bought and sold what we could we even learned more things naxala met a funny human male out here she didnt like him though because this town had some syndar and we knew they were magical we decided to finally practice some rituals and offer our services in the magical arts some years later we set port at yet another town and the crew partied hard year 200 was a momentous occasion it was the turn of the century at least for the humans it was fun nonetheless a few of my tribesmen made the mistake of impregnating a few human females i was told that i should get out and have fun but i was still brooding over my wife and my old friendssoon we got out of that town we did make a killing in silver though ive never seen so much i was then told by the old captain that i was ready to sail on my own and that in the next town he was going to buy his own ship he gave me his tricorn and told me to have a speech prepared for his crew i presented my speech to the ships crew and told them what was going on a few followed the old captain while some stayed aboard i stayed in contact with the old captain though hawk letting him know of my endeavors we finally set port near the kingdom of vandregon only to find the most horrific sight undead and hordes of them quickly we raised the anchor and kept going to warn the nearby villages we knew of the undead but seeing them was truly terrifying i didnt even believe they existed until now we picked up as many people as possible along the way and we became more of a transport ship at this point i stopped at every port selling my wares for cheap some of my men decided to help out with the war the deeper i got into human territory the more people didnt believe that i was a captain i kept selling wares and porting people across faedrun as we were recruiting for the ship i was asked to personally join the war i declined as i would be useless the best thing i could do was transport people and buy and sell goods we nearly sold all of our wares and some of my crew who had sustained wounds in the war began dying due to their infections and injuries the best thing i could do was have my clerics cleanse the body but that wasnt enough as too many people were afflicted i stopped taking wounded men on board as it would be pointless after a few years of being a transport and merchant ship we began to have a rather large crew and a boat filled with people so i sailed away from faedrun once i got word of mardrun i was one of the first boats to arrive and i became a shuttle service for the survivors repairs became costly for my ship and i was running out of funds to feed my crew so i dropped off a few of my advisers to establish a foothold in mardrun so we wouldnt just be known as a transport service i knew my ship wouldnt last long on these waters my ship was on its last voyage to mardrun when it started sinking as we were getting closer to mardrun my ship washed up on the coast and broke down little more than a pile of debris by the time it tasted the shore i got every person off and i began to send out dinghies that i had in storage i then hopped in my own dinghy and sailed to the continent i began working as an adviser for awhile thanks to my knowledge of how politics worked i reunited with my tribe and we began work making some mechanical crafts and selling them i was still working as a politician until word got out that i was a feral syndar and i was dismissed im not sure how they found out as i was making sure to conceal any signs of my heritage over the years we continued to sell merchandise and help with the coalition as much as possible i began making stuff for free as i wanted to be in good favor with the survivors and the ulven i made no silver but my tribe continued to create for silver i was a politician after all and i was also trying to establish a new tribe of feral syndar and feral syndar sympathizers i have to look good to recruit more people some years later my tribe began to be separated as we were out helping in different areas so me and naxala began working some odd jobs to make ends meet while working i caught the eye of a fellow feral syndar named alexander vallen he worked in the guard and we had a nice conversation about the homeland i had no idea he was my brother until he talked about mom i was really young then but i still remember her features and it sounded just like her i began to ask him about her origins and he told me that she was from fawyth and she was part of the wolfgang tribe this kid was definitely my brother as no one here knows about the wolfgang tribe but my tribe so i told him my story one night and it was a joyous moment i also told him my plans and would love for him to join once my settlement was established i knew the path that lay ahead of me but the cost of living in newhope seemed to get in the way at every turn before long our funds had run out almost completely and i could no longer afford to feed or shelter anyone but myself and naxala i spoke to those who had remained with me this far telling them to go out into the world to make their own way because i could not help them now some were reluctant but my insistence was enough to drive them away one day ill find them again when i can afford to help them live the lives they deserve i had done some research and found a few mage guilds in the area i figured this would be the best place to hold up for awhile and stop scraping from the bottom of the barrel i had started to go check out the spire as i would rather stay with young humans than condescending syndar at least i can infest their minds about which of the syndar is truly the master race we traversed to the spire which opened its doors to us for the time being a courtesy provided by alexander vallen as he was a valuable member of the archons i dared not question as the reasonings as to why he chose the spire when he had a cushy job being a guard but i know he made a better choice here he had a lot of untapped power and i wanted to teach him but i also had untapped power myself i did teach him a thing or two about rituals i spent my time at the spire researching magic and teaching young minds about my race i had been finally called upon to help the archons as i heard troubling news that alexander was going to help with new aldoria and he left me his silver to go pursue it he told me that i should re emerge and tell people that i am a shaman i suppose it is finally time to show my face to the world and help once againaramaeyis was born a small frail syndar child in the kingdom of tielorrien in the year 245 but loved by his parents nonetheless miraluya whisperwind was a performer recognized for the fluidity of her movements that made her feral syndar traits much more acceptable to others around her her husband korvarric whisperwind owned a small tavern that was always filled with the sounds of music from his instruments and laughter from the patrons they worshipped the goddess lunara and it showed by the love and care they showed one another and even more so to aramaeyis as he continued to grow aramaeyis developed small fangs and claws much to the dismay of his mother who worried it would be hard for him to fit in even though syndar always inherit traits from their mothers she had hoped and prayed that aramaeyis would be different but the only serous trait developed from his father was his normal skin and one green eye while the other was blue like hers when the undead plague started to ravage the syndar lands his parents sold and traded what they could to book passage to the new world hoping to keep aramaeyis safe as they made their way to their escape point his father was caught by a a pack of undead he fought and clawed against the creatures begging miraluya to take aramaeyis away save our son my love he screamed and when it is time may lunara bring our love into the mana stream once more the image of his father being ravaged by the undead and his blood quenching the earth itself bore itself into aramaeyis mind it would be something he would never forget and the sight of blood itself brought up a feeling of disgust in his gut upon arriving to madrun they found a small home in the settlement of new hope fearful that he would grow to resent other syndar for being shunned for his appearance miraluya started to teach aramaeyis about how important the mana stream really was to their people and also started to teach him to dance grief was taking her at the loss of her beloved and she had to leave aramaeyis with some way to deal with the disgust of others and instead turn it into something passionate and raw she was surprised how easily he was able to take to her teachings his body moving in ways even she couldnt he had such control  such emotion and such beauty to his movements that it left her amazed aramaeyis was always at home amongst the flowers and the trees he danced everyday within the forests claiming the mana stream guided his body and filled him with energy and love as his mother approached one day aramaeyis bowed his head closed his eyes and greeted her in the way syndar were normally accustomed to siala kay nu mother it shook her to see her son in the light his fangs and nails had grown longer his eyes shined brightly among the sunlight peeking through the trees and he was growing into a man she sat aramaeyis down and started to tell him stories of what she did before she met his father her dances were a way for her to gather money enough to survive she danced in taverns and even personally for men and women alike and watched as they looked upon her in awe you must remember my love and my life our dance is a form of art and will show people who you really are you can also use it to alter the emotions of others all syndar are born with magic and you will learn to harness yours through your movements make them feel them music the emotions and the passion your dances bring the only thing i ask of you aramaeyis is to promise to never take the life of another your heart is large and grief is a deadly poison to our people my prayer is that you never have to experience the destruction of taking anothers life looking upon his mother aramaeyis grew worried but he nodded his head softly and said i promise mother i will only bring joy to those i come across a few years later miraluya grew sickly aramaeyis remembered her stories of dancing for money and saw it as a way to try and get some medicine for his mother even though she pleaded and begged for him not to go along the same path as her he wouldnt listen losing his mother was something aramaeyis could not stomach knowing no tavern would take him now he started to perform in the streets drawing small crowds at first that grew larger everyday as people started to be entranced by his movements he soon started to learn that people sought him out for more than dances they wanted a companion which to aramaeyis who was shunned for always being different was an appealing thought he soon learned however that companionship meant more than he thought it did men and women alike requested him after being entranced by his dances but it brought about the money he needed to care for his mother aramaeyis soon learned that those who he shared a bed with also liked to share the secrets of others while relaxed he also found out that some people would pay quite well from secrets learned from others among those he danced for aramaeyis met an eccentric man by the name of thanderion he aroused the curiosities in aramaeyis with his stories of dueling and fencing and boasted that he himself was the most famous and well known fencer among the land as aramaeyis spent time with thanderion and learned more about the world they were in he learned of a place called the brown chicken brown cow an establishment that excelled at the skills his mother used to display and that he started to learn himself it was run by a woman named marrah whose beauty was only matched by the sharpness of her tongue it intrigued him to learn that everyone there was excepted by her as long as you had something to offer her eventually the grief took miraluya the loss of her husband and loss of her sons pure nature became too much for her her only wish was that her son would find happiness in everything he did the loss of his mother however stung aramaeyis like a blade to the heart she was the only person that truly accepted all of him and loved him for it and now she was no more even though he knew she would be returned to the mana stream the thought of never feeling her warmth and her love again became a pit in his stomach as the years went on he turned to joys of the spirit and his dances became more feral more raw thanderion visited once again and upon seeing aramaeyis in this state offered to travel with him to see marrah he hoped that finding a place where he would be included would keep maey from going down a darker path as they traveled they grew closer as friends and the smile that once used to light maeys face was brighter than before as they traveled they came upon the company of an ulven camp maey had always regarded the ulven with a large amount of respect knowing that even though the ulven were large and beast like honor was the highest priority to them as they approached he realized they were armed and the symbol of a great wolf was shown among them its the wardens of the great wolf thanderion explained they are a band of warriors healers and the like who believe in honor and justice among all things it would seem we are lucky young maey marrah is one of them maey grew excited upon seeing how diverse this group was they all seemed to enjoy the company of one another and even upon seeing maeys fangs and claws looked upon him as they would any other thanderion led maey to a beautiful woman who he soon learned was marrah herself he tells me you have a gift of movement as well as the gift of tongue marrah looked upon maey studying his appearance i heard of a certain feral syndar dancer who had a way with secrets we were actually hoping to run across you among our travels you must know that serving me has its perks however you are mine the wardens are a group who believe in honor and justice but we realize that passion and pleasure also bring in necessary coin be mine and i promise you a life of thrills secrets and music to rile your very soul maey couldnt resist her the woman was a master of words and before he knew it he was nodding his head as marrah placed a collar around his neck youll come to love it trust me as maey traveled with the wardens he grew quite fond of those he traveled with they all came from different lives and had their own tragedies and they understood him even though thinking of his parents always drove sadness into his face he remembered his oath to his mother to always bring joy to others and never harm some of the wardens were indifferent about the oath but respected it nonetheless marrah wanted to prepare maey for a grand event they were preparing for as the group prepared for their journey he couldnt be more excited to see what life among the wardens and his new friends would bringanariel was born in the year 216 in the maykar desert her parents were very loving with her and

other phoenix her dad was a hunter and gatherer in the commune they were a part of and her mother traveled a lot with the caravans the phoenix organized and ran the caravan to help themselves and the humans of the desert to always stay in supply of the things they needed it also provided them with travel and new stories to hear from their surrounding friends she lived a happy and contented life surrounded by kind and caring friends and family she would float around with what ever may hold her interest at the time she would go out and gather plants or hunt for animals with her dad he taught her how to use a bow or she would travel the caravan with her mother when she wasnt doing her studies in the village when she was ten she was tested and found to have magic on the arcane side as a present her parents gave her a young camel which she named clementine she would spend a lot of time with clementine and would go for days just wandering around the desert with only her for companionship after the required year of training had passed she stayed on to learn even more of the arcane magic she was usually a good student when she was paying attention when she was 16 the news came that the phoenix were to leave the desert and trek into the unknown both of her parents had decided they were to leave the desert and urged her to come with scared but ready for an adventure she packed all of her belongings and set off with her parents and clementine at her side the trip was nothing like anariel had experienced in her life before food was rationed her parents didnt want her to wander off too far it was repetitious slow moving and it restricted her roaming when they reached the docks of aldoria the noise and numbers or people were almost overwhelming the stares the sneers the open awe from all the people she didnt understand why they looking until her father explained that what they were doing was not normal and what they were asking for was unheard of but this is what solarus told us to do daddy yes my bird but not everyone understands him the way we do but he will provide for us like he always has wont he he provides a way but it is up to us to get there sometimes

she has found a way but she needs our help she needs your help what can i do to help she found a captain but he wants money from us more then we have so yara is asking us to part with anything we can

yes daddy can i please say good bye to her first of course my dear solara will be proud of you i am proud of you most of the trip was a blur anariel was still mourning the loss of clementine and didnt notice much else she stayed in the lower parts of the ship listening to what was going on but not really understanding the consequences the other ship was lost a sickness was going around then yara passing away it didnt mean anything to anariel she was still lost in her grief one day her mother came down told her they had found land and that they will be upon it soon anariels response was the same as it always was to just lay there unresponsive you need to stop being selfish anariel we have all lost something precious in our life we can mourn and then we must move on it is life i need you

from the ship skinny weak and pale the protectors that used to guard the caravans back in the desert were scouting ahead seeing if there was a threat on the new land when anariels eyes adjusted to the bright sun and her feet were on solid ground she looked around so much green trees bushes shrubs everywhere she looked it was greens or blues from the ocean and sky a glint of color caught her eye it was a beautiful bird he looked like a rainbow blue and yellow with a bit of green on his head he had a big curved beak he looked down on her thru one eye with his head tilted how strange he was anariel looked around the strange land again looking through different eyes she saw the beauty the wonder and the promise of a new land she looked back at the bird and with a smile walked further into

shall see if there are any issues he needs help with or any other necessities day 4 today this one has shown phaedra what some of our normal duties in each town will be we had nothing exciting to deal with today some farmers wanted us to officiate a start of the harvest with a prayer to lunara there was a land dispute that this one had to quell by having magistrate arowen find the documents of purchase this one really does not mind the easy days he remembers a few days under his old master where we were rushing to keep up with our demands this one even remember officiating over a rahd noc that was an experience this one will not soon forget day 5 we will head out to our next town either in the morning or that of the next day we have had only a joining ceremony to attend and say a blessing at risoul is run well and does not need much help from us day 6 magister arowen has asked this one to stay in town one more day in case of any emergencies that may arise this one agreed to do

eye we are headed out in the morning to faywerth it is only a days walk out towards the coast day 7 we have just arrived in faywerth and given residence with the magistrate his name is rowjak this on

livestock ownership issue as well as sitting in on a trial of a thief this one did make sure to help when phadrea did not know what exactaly to do but he did not have to help overly much she seems to absorb her information quite quickly and quite well day 9 we had a few more trials to sit in on today it seems that some humans are trying to move towards the coast and are causing an issue while passing through thinking they can take what they want within this town humans seem to cause much more trouble than this one would care to deal with phaedra again took the lead today and only needed minor help from this one this one is thoroughly pleased with her skills day 10 phaedra has surpassed all expectations this one is greatly impressed with not only her intelligence but her grace and tact as well she has had a hand in answering many disputes brought to us she has truly exceeded what her instructors have said day 20 this one is hearing rumors in every town that we are losing this war against the undead it would seem to this one that each town has less hope than the last morale has dropped since the maykar turned this one knows though that solara and lunara will see us through day 30 we met some survivors of an attack by the undead this one has never seen a group so full of despair this one thanks lunara that we have phaedra she tended to some of the wounded and went about boosting their spirits day 31 a human child died in our care today phaedra was greatly saddened by this event she has told this one that his name was iain he was so young phaedra has asked this one to accompany her to the funeral this seems to be difficult for her day 32 the service was short the child was buried in the cemetery west of town phaedra cared for the family this one laid flowers upon his grave today is a day filled with sadness day 33 the young boys sister emilia this one believes has really taken a liking to phaedra its no wonder she is a great comfort their family is staying with us for the moment her mother and father thank us profusely for the hospitality but this one informs them that it is our pleasure in helping them day 34 the family has left us today to find some short term home they were talking of heading to the new continent this talk is becoming more and more common mayhaps that time will come where it is the only option but this one still holds hope in the gods emilia was forlorn in having to leave her now good friend phaedra she still remains a comfort for the girl and for this one day 35 this one did much running around today there were still many injured to tend to and this one is no healer this one did his best to make sure all was running smoothly there were a few conflicts between some of the refugees this one is surprised at the petty behavior of some of those who have barely escaped death phaedra was looking exhausted so this one told her to rest she will need her strength later on we all will day 36 this one is absolutely appalled at the behavior he has witnessed today the reason these men have come back injured is clearly due to themselves this poor human girl who was helping tend to the wounded was being harassed and called after those disgusting amoral excuses for men should be cast out from their ranks this one stepped in and asked the girl to leave and tend to a different group this one is furious and will have a few words with the commanding officers tomorrow day 37 this one spoke with their commander today ser reginald this one felt great pleasure in seeing those men get reprimanded and forced to apologize

spoken with the commander and they are to stand trial tomorrow for their crimes they will be placed in a holding cell for the time being this one will make certain they are punished to the fullest extent of our laws this one will have phaedra help on other matters tomorrow so she will not be burdened by the disgusting behavior of these pigs day 40 this one is shaken we were evacuated from the town the penitent were to be marching there soon this one must not show fear this one must remain strong for the group for phaedra day 41 we had to make do with taking shelter in an abandoned cottage the penitent are not far behind more and more cities are falling to them and the undead they must devour the bodies of the fallen or bring them back somehow it seems to this one that as our strength decreases theirs increases it is unnerving to say the very least this one must remain strong and unshaken this one must carry on for the group and for her day 107 more and more reports of people fleeing to the new continent this one is weakening but this one must be strong for her the gods will protect us wont they we are their chosen children day 160 this one does not know what to do why do the gods allow such a travesty to continue we came across an attacked village the corpses were mutilated there were women and children this one must remain strong but this one does not know how day

least day 300 phaedra and this one were able to finally find some peace today we walked along the coast at twilight this one talked of his time as a student phaedra seemed entertained at the notion of this one as a student she says this one is a know it all this one was also able to discuss his teaching styles and phaedra reassured him that he is doing well it was a nice day to have and it did this one good this one will truly be saddened when he is no longer her teacher maybe this one will not petition after two years we shall have to see day 361 the undead have taken these lands we must flee

was born to the caravan lifestyle and traveled as a child with her parents and her tribe learning desert survival and the ways of trading alongside practical skills like alchemy and herbalism which always served a syndar in good stead be she in the desert or the plainsthe phoenix lifestyle in the desert suited her well but as a young adult she began to undertake special trading trips to locations off the typical routes as an excuse to wander one of these trips took her to a section of road that she shared with a young naran mage he was on the cusp of taking up travel as a way to better himself she found him both interesting and entertaining the two took to traveling together exploring bits of faedrun in the outskirts of naran territory they bordered on scandal the young native mage traveling alongside the bold and blunt phoenix apothecary a combination of the young narans curiosity and rindis own wanderlust led them beyond the borders of nara pentare permitting the two to make enemies and friends abroad from both of their homelands it was a sad day when the message arrived for rindis naran friend though in the same heartbeat it was a message that gave him the path to making his own way as a true adult and not just a mage traveling to learn more about himself thus rindis returned to the maykar desert and her tribe while the young naran reported to vandregons 5th for his final proving rindis help would only have brought doubt to his honor and that was unacceptable it was two years later that she regretted not continuing to travel alongside him

those who resumed the running of trade routes and began to travel the length and breath of mardrun in many ways it was much like traveling faedrun and in others it was profoundly unlike anywhere she had ever been before it was the lands around serai that her heart belonged to following the maykar settlement being built it reminded her of the desert she had been born to and the past she would never be able to forget she made friends amongst both the maykar and the kaerim who traveled in the desert and built no settlements eventually one asked her to come with him to marry him contrary to the typical phoenix approach to this she said yes al moalej her healer was someone she cared deeply for and wanted no technicality to ever separate her from him the last dear friend shed left alone

made any difference i know that but i would not have this guilt on my conscience that is why i took the rahd noc i will never let anything like that happen ever again in the name of the galendhidur

coming to new hope although conflict was avoided tension from both sides still created injury both purposeful and accidentally after much work in new hope and the surrounding area i now travel to practice my healing and swordplay to protect the innocent i hope the gods watch over me and allow me to do much work i have been traveling around the interior of clan nightrivers land offering my service as a healer for a few years now there is one thing i must say from my few years of practicing my craft by myself the two most harrowing sounds are the cries of a parent as they lose a child and a lover losing their other half to the cold grip of death i have heard both up close and personal and have caused more than my fair share from my failure to save a life hopefully the gods can forgive me and take away the screams i hear in my nightmares every night i pray the gods will allow me this last hope i am making my way towards the front line of the grimward invasion as a way to repent for these losses and to offer my aid to those in need i hope to survive on the hospitality of others and offer my services cheap or no cost at all but i will have to see how that works out for mecharacter ivar player joe pierce race human class warrior origin richtcrag bio born to helga and braun wolfspliter life with them was short and ended tragically during a late night raid victims lost to slaughter in this cold night of resolution this village had been fighting off the undead hoards productively for years  many proud and famous warriors sprung from the loins of this settlement carving their way writing their stories of valor and glory in pools of enemies blood but not this night  this night there would be no stories to tell  no glory to behold this night there is only darkness an end of this village as the screams of the first victims alerted the others helga took her son and hid him in the food storage locker sleeping softly nestled in a basket of bread loaves and honey rolls too young to understand what was happening around him as the undead slashed stabbed and then chewed their way from one end of the village to the other till all were processed into an unrecognizable version of their former selves when the dawn broke and light shined in var ran from his hiding place the next few years where not much more than a blur for var work small jobs earning coin and always moving running in his fleeing he found himself on this new continent he still worked and moved restlessly but with less fear in his movements working for a few weeks at a time instead of days even staying a few months in places but still always packing up and leaving when that restless feeling would rear its head it was on one such of these moves when var was 25 that it happened his party was raided vars group had stumbled near enough to a mordok settlement where the occupants were none too pleased the group had been either killed or ran off only var remained he had been slashed beaten battered and bruised within an inch of his life but the mordok seemed to have a use for him in this state a commanding figure walked forth and looked at var it seemed to bark some guttural orders to those around and they dragged var into a wooden cage and locked him inside var passed out soon after var has no real account of how long they kept him locked up they kept him in a weakened state they barely fed and watered him it seemed it was only enough that he wouldnt die many would come and stab at him or scream at him once in a while the same commanding figure would come to look at him it would seem to mumble to itself and cast some bones then shake its head and leave it appeared to be a shaman one of these visits the shaman seemed excited by the casting and there was a large uproar with the others after however long of living in wretched filth for only the gods know the mordok seemed to have their use for var he was weak his head spun but he knew this could not be good for him in their hasty preparations they had finally left var without a guard he worked as hard and fast as his sickened body would allow he finally got the lashings free and slipped out of the cage that held him for so long he ran away from the camp as fast as his feet would carry him he was a good distance away when he heard their shouts of rage he knew they would catch him and quickly he came to a small stream and tried to wade through but it was much deeper than he expected he started trying to swim but was easily swept away var barely held on to his thought he was fading fast he drifted for what felt like days but was in reality only an hour he felt something lift him out of the water and he slipped into an unconscious state he awoke in what appeared to be a long house surrounded by people it had been so long since he had seen any one else he was shocked he did not know what to do the eldest male stepped forward what is your name he asked it had been so long var had lost so much of himself there he could not speak his throat hurt the man saw that it was a struggle for var and said i brom pointing at himself var was able to force out i var ivar it is said brom with a smile in his new home  now ivar had relearned how to be human how to talk and how to write how to hunt and how to farm all the skills he had lost in captivity finding his place in this tribal warrior community his ferocity got him far amongst his peers the simple fact of the matter is his old family on the happiest holiday of the year was rougher than this races worst day ever this gave him an edge in the warrior department all the time trying to fit in  trying to be the best warrior  hunter provider but it was only a matter of time before ivars restless nature grab hold again and he

from beneath your feet seen the bedrock your beliefs are based on dissolve i have i wish i could say that i came through it as a better man but among the things i deny myself is lying the king had risen from the grave he had welcomed the undead and the penitent with open arms and the vandregonians reacted without hesitation i wasnt there when they finally destroyed civilisation i didnt even know it had happened till months after the fact i was camping in the vandregonian forests hiking through the backcountry and it wasnt for recreation i cant blame the vandregonians for attacking saresh or even for breaking our nation we did betray them in their hour of need they didnt stop there though they smashed our artwork they toppled our minarets they burned our libraries and even that could have been forgiven but they believed that just because we didnt defect to the vandregonians that we embraced the undead they made it their crusade to put to the sword all of us who remained and in doing so erased from the earth the chance to rebuild heaven unacceptable and so we found ourselves my wife and i and a few others far from any road and making our way to aldoria our hope was to leave this all behind to catch a ship heading to mardrun we crossed vandregon in secret fearful of contact with others lest we be judged by the color of our skin we were scarcely over the border when we met the undead line advancing southward and were turned from our goal it seemed at times that we were mere steps ahead of the undead as we flew to the south ever fearful of approaching vandregonians again it felt like it took a lifetime to get there but we finally made it to a working port we had even managed to find some of the few remaining maykar along the way buying passage on a ship headed to mardrun was out our means so we opted instead to work for our passage as crew we were lucky to have that chance as i am unaware of any ships that have sailed from faedrun since after our arrival on mardrun and with it the completion of our duties my wife and i joined with the other maykar we had traveled with in founding a settlement to call our own with saresh destroyed and so few of us alive rebuilding heaven on earth was beyond our means we opted instead to find a secluded corner of wilderness to call our own and to preserve what was left of our cultureplayed by ryan jopp character name

shape he pledged to the stormjarlnew aldorian contract enemy not wanting to be left behind when the gallant feathers went to fight corruption continued to wrack his body and fester his wounds making death imminent the last patrol in during the second month aimerick refused to stay back at camp or with the supply wagons and ended up succumbing to wounds taken to the battle his body was burned on a pyre alongside other fallen warriors of the campaign bio  background history aimerick was born to a normal family his mother was involved in some of the affairs of nobility but mainly as an assistant to many different business contracts his father was a professional mercenary a member of the iochlaocra what began as a romantic evening of swooning and courting between a lady and an intriguing mercenary quickly turned into a broken family of raising a child amidst growing gambling debt and drinking problems needless to say aimericks parents had no love for each other growing up in the bustling districts of aldoria saw all sorts of adventures and trouble for aimerick he commonly ran with the wrong crowd and ended up working off many petty childhood crimes or debts of service his mother grew cold and was busy working so their bond never really took hold although she loved him he was a constant burden on someone trying to make a living his father on the other hand would return after being away for many months on some sort of contract he loved to play with his son and to aimerick he was a legendary hero in a funny hat this further drove a wedge between aimerick and his mother she worked hard to provide for him and his attention was fixated on his father the sporadic times he visited before disappearing to the nearby casinos taverns and brothels as aimerick grew older he took random jobs to help around the house and began to live a rather normal life on his 15th birthday he received a letter his father had been killed on a contract two nobles squabbling over some property hired opposing mercenaries to fight it out resulting in the death of aimericks father there was no grand explanation no epic battle to detail his final moments just a note about taking an arrow through the throat and a small severance package of silver coin for his service this is when the war with the undead became real they marched on aldoria tearing across the land and the kingdom was about to be lost during the fall aimericks mother bought him passage on a boat but was forced to remain behind he still does not know if she survived or not if she made it on another boat but with no word for years it does not look hopeful upon arriving in newhope aimerick took up random small jobs and eventually took up mercenary work it tugged at the experience he gained from his rough life in the streets of aldoria threatening to engulf him in crime and petty fights it wasnt until the gallant feathers mercenary unit made a visit to newhope that aimerick found his true calling he fondly remembered the days of his father the prestige of being in a real and professional mercenary unit he volunteered and eventually joined becoming a member of the gallant feathers

rehabilitation program in starkhaven and then banished to the fire isle of the phoenix to spend no less than 1 year doing community service during the many battles of the war against the undead on faedrun a caravan was sent to the people of the maykar dominion a symbol of good will and solidarity from the people of vandregon my mother was a part of that caravan a ranger in the service of the vandregonian army pressing their way past the undead surrounding the border of saresh the caravan was immediately greeted with open arms and ushered into the city food and water were brought to the visitors and clerics were sent to tend to the wounded my father was one of these clerics such is young love that my mother convinced my father to return to vandregon with her to ensure her safety in the war their timing could not have been better as the month following their departure saw the betrayal of the maykar dominion fueled by his belief in a balance of the world my father sought to bring new life to faedrun to help offset the death caused by the penitent undead and now his own people for seven years my parents tried to conceive although they grew increasingly depressed as their efforts remained fruitless my mother turned to alcohol terrified of the possibility that she might never have been a mother that no life would follow her my father growing concerned for my mother informed her that he would begin to meditate and pray for an answer for two days he neither ate nor drank deep in prayer when he emerged he took my mother in his arms a look of determination and purpose filling his eyes and whispered my prayers have been answered that night i was conceived the months passed and my parents moved from outpost to outpost my father providing healing to the wounded soldiers there my mother scouting and hunting for food all was well until four months after my father awoke from his meditation riding from the small village of thornborough to the nearby yewford outpost a pair of bandits spooked my mothers horse throwing her from its back my father no stranger to combat though no friend of war drew his mace and slew one of the bandits causing the other to flee before he returned to his wifes side her head was bleeding from the fall and although shallow her breath was clear my father held his wife as he rode to his destination apologizing to none for depleting his mana trying to revive her instead of healing the soldiers he brought healers to her side though they could not divine why she would not wake a cleric of the order of arnaths fist stationed in the outpost tried his hand at healing my mother to no avail desperate my father even called upon the serous and feral syndar in the region offering a substantial reward drawn from his earnings as a healer to bring his wife back to him try as they might none could rouse my mother from her slumber my father began to spend more and more time in prayer locked in his room as the months passed with no progress five months of loneliness followed my father though he refused to leave his wifes side again he decided to enter his meditative state losing himself in his prayers asking for a miracle those close to him grew anxious as he prayed with nearly a week spent in meditation we was finally awoken by the screams of my mother finally returned to consciousness by the labor of childbirth he returned to her side rapidly grasping her hand throughout the ordeal when he was finally allowed to hold me he wept openly thankful that where he thought he had lost a life he now had two my mother exhausted by the ordeal returned to her sleep although her breathing was even and she awoke the next morning as i was growing up my parents taught me about many subjects i learned of the balance and patience through my father my mother taught me to reason and infer my curiosity amazed them and i would never be satisfied that i knew enough they were kind to me and answered any questions i could think of until i became old enough to wonder about my last name why was it so different from the other children where did it come from those are questions that we will answer when you are older my child they would say to me youre only four when we know you are mature enough to handle the answer we will tell you for three years i would bother my parents and any townsfolk who would indulge me with as many questions as i could ask one day i noticed my mother beginning to swell around her belly and decided to find out why i asked my father why is mommy getting bigger she has a child growing in her my dear he explained the healers think itll be a little boy youre going to have a brother i practically squealed with excitement and couldnt wait to tell everyone who would listen my father tried to grab me as i ran out the door but i was small and eluded his grasp i ran up to the first person i saw a tall thin man with the hood on his elegant robe pulled over his head im going to have a brother i shouted to him to which he drew back his hood and smiled at me i noticed his large pointed ears and couldnt help myself i had heard of the syndar but never actually encountered one are you a syndar why are you wearing that robe where did you come from a brother you say well that certainly is cause for celebration he calmly told me looking up to see my father running down the path behind me clearly flustered i am terribly sorry stranger my daughter isexcitable at times my father apologized shiloh dont bother the man im sure hes plenty busy without having to worry about you no need for apologies the syndar assured my father this one is in no rush and new life is always good news this one is called talvor and is a mage from tierlorrien my father extended his hand to the syndar faisal dalrashid this is my im shiloh i interrupted drawing a scowl from my father you have quite a lot of energy dont you young one talvor asked stooping to look me in the eye tell me child what do you know of the arcane not much i responded although the fire of curiosity had already been lit my daddy taught me all about divine magic but i was never really good at it the magical arts are not for everyone child talvor explained he then turned to address my father your daughter is curious and passionate this one would very much like to help her develop into a very capable mage with your permission of course all this one would require is a meal and a roof during the training oh please daddy can i i begged my youthful excitement getting the better of me well have to discuss it with your mother shiloh my father replied then offered his hand again to the syndar talvor was it if you feel so inclined we would be happy to have you for dinner perhaps you would be more capable of convincing my wife staring at my fathers hand talvor instead bowed low it would be an honor and privilege this one graciously accepts talvor joined us for dinner that night and after a long discussion with my parents they agreed to give him my fathers old study for a room and keep him fed if he would teach me the ways of arcane magic my lessons were simple at first learning to meditate to focus my mind and will i struggled with these lessons for nearly a year before i was finally able to concentrate my baby brother was born during one of these lessons and it nearly killed me to not be able to run and see him but talvor convinced me to sit he will still be there when you finish your lesson be patient and the fruit you pick will be ever sweeter from there i learned the basics of harnessing mana how magic flowed through everything in the world it was simply a matter of finding and redirecting this energy eventually talvor showed me a few basic spells mostly things to protect myself such as stunning an enemy or throwing them backwards giving me time to run or cloaking myself in a shroud of protective energy shielding me from an attack your father has taught you that life is precious correct talvor asked me one day to which i nodded silently good he is a wise man your father and most certainly correct your life is the most precious thing you own as such you may someday come across someone who wishes to take it from you whom the spells this one has shown you will not deter this next spell is intended to hurt another and if used in certain circumstances can even kill this one prays you will never need to use it but is also of the mind that one is better served by being prepared for the worst he showed me how to create the ball of energy and hurl it at a target landing a blow one might expect to see from a mace i was shocked by the power i now had but promised talvor to only use it if necessary i noticed around this time that my parents seemed to be growing nervous though they would never tell me why one night when i heard them arguing from my room i snuck away to listen to their conversation we cant stay here faisal the penitent are practically at our doorstep in numbers we cant possibly stand against we have to take what we can and leave and where do you suppose we go andrea were already deep in vandregon territory the syndar have fled to their homes to the north most of the maykar have turned on us even aldoria is struggling to survive we have nowhere left to run well theres always andrea weve talked about this we dont know what kind of people are already on this new continent ive heard some rumors about wolfmen there attacking any settlers who set foot on their shores those are just rumors faisal and you said it yourself we dont have many options we need to go to mardrun and pray for the best my father sighed i suppose not but how will we tell shiloh by now tears were streaming down my face scared of what was to come i drew a short breath clapping my hand over my mouth once i realized that any chance of stealth i had was now completely gone my mother glanced in my direction it seems we wont have to dear come on out sweetie youre not in trouble i ran into my mothers arms and cried until i fell asleep all the while listening to her tell me over and over that everything would be okay i knew she was just as scared as i was but still her voice made me believe her words and i knew she was right we would all be fine the next morning we left for the coast packing as many of our belongings as we could carry as we boarded the ships to the new world i had heard rumors of terrible storms and ghost ships destroying the vessels carrying refugees but was happy to say that my family made it to mardrun without incident we landed then joined a caravan heading to the city of new hope it would appear that our arrival came at a most opportune moment as just a week before the colonists had declared a truce with the ulven in the region making our lives significantly less stressful and much less dangerous for six years my family worked and survived in the new city my mother once a ranger opened a small tavern to tend to weary souls while my father lent his healing talents to many of the soldiers and guards of the town my brother as he was growing up made known his hatred of his schooling preferring to wrestle and play with his friends i quickly found work helping in the citys library content to spend endless hours poring over tomes and stories of old while taking any opportunity i could find to discuss what i had been reading with anyone who would listen the librarians paid me a small wage for my work not enough to live off of alone but enough to help out my parents we were content although my thoughts would often drift back to talvor and his teachings i had grown to love the syndar as an uncle and heard that he had booked passage on a separate ship though i had not heard of his fate nor had i seen him in the city on my fourteenth birthday i had grown too curious about talvor and wanted to continue my training so i set out to find him i began at the library talking to anyone who looked like they might know something before i knew what had happened i had followed a trail of whispers into an alley in a part of town i had never seen before well well well what do we have here looks like a little rich girl how about you just hand over that little coin purse youve got there and we can all walk out of this happy hmm i heard a voice from behind me say i spun on my heels to face the source seeing a man in a leather breastplate walking down the alley towards me he had a scar down his cheek and wore a pair of daggers on his hip though i could tell that he wouldnt need them to hurt me thinking back to my training with talvor i drew my magical protection around me prepared to cast another spell if he drew closer the man took a step forward now now these streets are dangerous for a young lady like you to be wandering alone another step towards me do you know why theyre dangerous little girl another step i was frozen in fear and he was no more than five feet away from me now its because of people like me he lunged forward drawing one of his blades and striking with it colliding with the magical barrier before he could recover and land another blow i threw him backwards with a burst of magical force turning to run away i rounded a corner praying the man wouldnt follow me soon enough though the man found me although i had enough time to throw a stunning bolt at him knocking one of his feet out from beneath him and blinding him for a short time again i turned to run but found myself in a dead end with the man close behind me out of mana and out of options i curled up in the corner not ready to face what was about to happen with my head buried in my hands i jumped when i heard a crash next to me sure that my assailant was coming to end my life instead of feeling the steel pierce my skin though i heard a voice a familiar voice an urgent voice run i looked up to see talvor standing in the alleyway with my attacker laying in a heap next to me though he was starting to stir and rise i bolted from my position and hugged my old friend around the waist before moving to stand behind him as he primed another spell the last one he had taught me before he left the bolt flew from his hand and struck the man in the ribs knocking the wind out of him and tearing a hole in his breastplate as the man started to rise talvor conjured another bolt and knocked him back down this time causing a nasty bruise on the mans shoulder twice more the man tried to rise and twice more he was struck down until his crumpled body rose no more talvor strode over to the man unsheathing one of his daggers and handing it to me it is never wise to be without a plan awestruck i could barely manage talvor hhow did you find me i was afraid you were gone this one heard you asking questions questions that should not be asked in these parts it is fortunate that this one came upon you at this time or else this one may have had one fewer student talvor drew a small vial from among the folds of his robe you are drained drink child you will be refreshed i took the vial and quickly swallowed the bluish liquid it contained a warmth grew through my extremities as i felt mana surge through my veins once more amazed i asked my old friend what was in the vial its a mana potion he told me seemingly shocked at my inexperience it restores ones mana in a pinch these are incredible where do you get them can you make them can i have another still just as curious as when the path this one walks departed from your own this one will try to answer your questions firstly most alchemists can make these potions although the prices for them are often quite steep this one is not an alchemist and therefore unable to produce these potions although there are contacts within the city finally no you may not have another they are expensive and take time to acquire now follow this one there is much to discuss before you return home talvor led me through the streets of new hope saying nothing as we meandered between shops and buildings finally coming to an unmarked door down an alley he led me through the door locking it tightly behind him the room we entered was small a kitchen of sorts a small stove squatted in the corner staring blankly at the table around which we sat short spent candles were spread around the table and every inch of every surface was covered in scrolls and paper talvor looked at me almost through me for a moment before he began this one is terribly sorry my dear but you are very important to my research you see long has this one felt his connection to the mana stream fading perhaps it is this ones old age perhaps it is something more regardless this one had been searching for a source of mana when you came forth it was like a sign from lunara that this ones quest was destined for success and my how you learned such a bright child talvor whats going on im sca silence this one is sorry child but you must learn your place as this is your fate now you see there is a skill one can learn where the mana in one being is transferred to another normally this is a willing gift although this ones research has led me to believe that it may be possible to force the process i stared at him terrified of what was about to happen he rose striding to a small chest of drawers along the back wall removing several sets of manacles returning to me apologies child but these are for your own safety this one worries to think of what would happen to you should you leave his statement struck me like a hammer driving home the realization that he had threatened me that he was no longer the man i knew the man i thought i knew with my wrists and ankles locked to the chair on which i sat talvor began to explain to me what would happen among the syndar there is a process known as hollowing through it one is stripped of their connection to the magical forces of the world it is a most dreadful fate this one however has discovered a way to scale back the process the ritual will draw upon your connection to these forces but will not sever it channeling the power elsewhere in this case to this one talvor began to chant as i began to struggle hoping beyond hope that i might be able to escape the manacles wouldnt budge and i screamed as i felt the icy fingers of his ritual magic caress my temples before plunging into my mind drawing out my mana ripping it from my head i slumped over in the chair physically and mentally exhausted by the ordeal talvor apparently not satisfied drew forth another potion offering it to me i refused pursing my lips together and turning my head away he grabbed me by the chin and forced the edge of the bottle past my teeth clasping a hand over my mouth and nose i fought against him but my body gave in before my mind swallowing hard for a breath of air i felt the mana surge through me again although i knew it would not last again apologies but this one required mana to save your life the mana must be returned again he began to chant and once more the icy fingers penetrated my mind i blacked out rather quickly losing consciousness before the ritual was complete when i finally came to i had a chance to truly look around the home there were no windows very few furnishings and any light that might have shone under the door would be blocked out by the shadows of the alleyway in which the door stood i was alone in the house keeping a watchful eye out for my captor confident that he was gone i scanned the house my eyes coming to rest on the key i believed would unlock my bindings unable to walk with the restraints i scraped along the floor on my chair until i was able to grab the key from its resting place on the table after much fidgeting i managed to unlock the manacle holding one of my hands then the other soon enough my legs were free as well and i rose to leave being drained like i had however effected my body as well i stood too quickly and my legs were unable to support me falling to the floor my back convulsed with short quiet cries i was still sitting on the floor when talvor returned i recoiled from his sight expecting retaliation for my attempt to escape instead he sat on the floor next to me and asked why i would try to flee were it not for this ones actions your life would be at its end does that not mean you owe this one a debt of gratitude but why are you doing this talvor why me why now your will is strong young one there are those that could not survive the process but this one feels that you will endure as for why this is happening now do you remember what this one told you when your brother was born be patient and the fruit you pick will be ever sweeter this one has been patient now it is time to reap the rewards no words could accurately describe my emotions at that point which was for the best none would have been able to cross my lips anyway i felt broken i felt ashamed i felt exposed but more than anything i felt tired i clung to consciousness just long enough to be lifted back into the chair from which i had just escaped sliding into blackness as i felt the restraints on my wrists and ankles fasten once again for a year this continued i would only be allowed outside with talvors supervision and only to run errands the rest of the day was spent confined to that awful chair while talvor would lose himself in his scrolls researching his rituals and performing experiments on me day after day he would drain the mana out of my body only to have it forced back upon me with another potion the warmth the rush of power i felt after consuming the potion was the only point of my day which was a release from my life as i had come to know it i grew to look forward to the dose i grew to like the taste i grew to crave that rush i grew to hate myself for it after that first year talvor believed that he had reached a breakthrough in his research this one knows why his experiments have been failing he exclaimed he quickly reigned in his excitement however you are too weak your connection to the mana stream is too weak this one will teach you strengthen your bond then we can continue so began my training though i would struggle and resist my natural curiosity got the better of me i succumbed to talvors instruction learning more powerful spells and training myself to harness more mana the experiments continued daily at talvors insistence because he didnt want to miss the threshold or something like that with each day my connection to the mana stream grew stronger as did the rush which followed drinking the potion in a few short months talvor had taught me all he could about arcane magic and the rush i found from the potions now was nearly overwhelming talvor kept bringing me these potions he kept giving me this sensation sure he treated me like a slave for that was what i had become but those small moments of ecstasy surely outweighed the bad i actually began to look forward to the experiments because i knew that a potion would soon follow the months continued to pass although my training was long since complete talvors experiments remained fruitless but his frustration grew daily i was close to him so i bore the brunt of his fury the bruises began to emerge but it was a small price to pay for my daily potion talvor began to trust me with running into town for small errands i would be given a few silver and would be sent to fetch bread or reagents for spells on one such trip i was stopped dead in my tracks a sheet of paper was stuck to the side of the building one i had seen many times before this time however my eye was drawn to the missing printed across the top of the face my face drawn on the front i tore down the paper and shoved it in my pouch afraid of being recognized i hurried about my business and ran back to talvors home tears starting to fill my eyes i flung the door open and threw the poster on his table i need to go see them talvor i cried you cannot child they would not recognize you they would not accept what you have become he replied and what am i you are mine on my seventeenth birthday talvor allowed me to join him on an expedition outside of the city walls we would be collecting a rare mushroom for one of his spells he told me we wandered past the gates pulling our cloaks up high to block our faces from the prying eyes of the city watchmen following a small dirt path off of the main road talvor and i came across a small cabin this is it child in there were going to find your mushroom inside a cabin do not question me child follow me talvor pushed past the old wooden door and led me inside the cabin where i was surprised to see four large men standing around a table torches in one hand the other on the hilts of their swords i did not see the figure sitting behind the table however until she stood up and walked towards me tall and thin her pointed ears protruded ever so slightly past her blonde hair her clothes were worn but still retained all of their previous elegance each step was accented by a slight jingle from her skirt her face bore a scar down one cheek and a wicked smile that was as far from sincere as a mortal could muster is this her talvor right down to business faelyn this one admires that talvor stood by the door as i remained helpless staring at him like a lost dog as this new woman approached me poked and prodded me asking me questions about my abilities after what seemed like hours faelyn reached into her pocket and removed a small pouch and tossed it at the ground by talvors feet he shot me an apologetic glance quickly broken as he bent down to pick up the bagwith his gaze averted faelyn motioned to her guards who drew their swords and approached my mentor i screamed trying to warn him to run but it was too late before he could stand back up my mentor was cut down before my eyes terrified sobs wracked my body as i started to channel the mana to begin to avenge my mentor when i felt a sharp pain in my cheek faelyn had slapped me drawing my concentration away from my spell and snapping me back to the overwhelming reality of the situation in which i found myself i knew that resisting would be futile and perhaps lethal so i made no moves as she placed a leather collar around my neck instructing me to follow her we werent even out of the cabin before her guards began to ransack talvors still bleeding body and i had to avoid looking at him overcome by a single emotion certainly not the one i would have expected i was thirsty never again would i be provided with the mana potions i had come to crave so much as we walked away i asked faelyn how i could acquire another just one more to satisfy my urge in midsentence however one of her guards had come running up to us a handful of scrolls in hand maam we found these on the syndar they look like they might be important good work charles faelyn responded unrolling one of the scrolls her eyes lit up as she saw what was written on the parchment yes these will do nicely girl you say you want another mana potion i think that we can work something outplayed by jacob beardsley name nico tizdra gender

238 i have an older sister and a younger brother we live in both the southern part of vandregon and northern part of the maykar dominion we move around a lot so it is sometimes hard to tell but we all consider ourselves true proud maykar as for the watchdogs we recruit from anywhere that will join its like a large second family right now the war is getting really tough and the winters are even worse its been thirteen years since the maykar betrayed everyone i wasnt born at the time so i dont remember anything but i do remember never having a true home the undead are worse than ever and its getting harder than ever to stay alive whole towns are left broken and bloody from the undead the watchdogs track and kill undead and do our best to stay alive thats easier said than done just last week we lost three and we lost ten the month before that were down to about twenty people from the fifty we had traveling with us a year ago well its time to pack up and move again so i got to quit writing for now september 16 249 some of my recent entries were ripped out of my journal i dont remember doing it or where they might be but i dont have time to worry about that now we found some survivors south of a village called carriagestead in the southern end of vandregon that brought us back up to about thirty people and so far we are holding that number november 02 249 we have just received reports of a large undead force moving to the north my father and the rest of the engagement team are planning to intercept them im not worried because they are all clerics and my father is even a witch just like my grandfather november 10 249 the engagement team just met back up with us they are badly hurt and broken the undead were too strong there were more cultists and greater undead than anticipated my father tried but had to give the order to retreat there are only a handful left out of the fifteen that went out january 20 250 winter sucks like usual less food every year and even less in winter so hungry but hey cant complain we found more survivors willing to fight were at twentyfive strong now the watchdogs have become more of a refugee caravan than an undead killing force but at least we are still helping people july 01 250 there was a vote last night to send me and my little brother away to the coast where it would be safe once there we were to learn life skills and trade skills the vote was unanimous and so im getting packed to move once again august 05 251 this was a surprise i found my journal in a box i had lost over a year ago where should i begin i

at alchemy im a man now a lot has changed for the worse of course the maykar is for a lack of a better term destroyed we are still blamed and ridiculed for betraying the vandregon shortly after aldoria closed its borders they were crushed from the inside out no word if they made it out or not the vandregon split its forces to fight on two fronts and we received word a couple years ago that the southern army has fallen the watchdogs have linked back up with us at the coast my father not with them he fell in battle against the revenant king he sacrificed himself to save the rest he left

small town in the kingdom of vandregon imara lived a simple life with her family she helped raise her brother and sister milked the cows fed the animals collected eggs and foraged for fresh food in the woods there were always clothes to patch up or a sibling to help out imara was very close to her father who would carve wooden handheld puzzles that she delighted in solving her older sister razel was married with a child and lived in the capitol of vandregon as a seamstress imaras town was remote but comfortable especially since she never asked much from life nor was she really aware of what else lay out there when she was 17 a small group of undead were sent to destroy the nearby village imaras farm had the bad fortune to be on the way they entered the home while the family was sleeping and attacked her family struggled to fight back as she fled to the village to sound the alarms for help once they were alerted the villagers were able to assemble well enough to repel the undead from the town sadly they were too late for imaras family when she went back to her farm it was burned to the ground her family was slain and all of the animals were either dead or gone she was left with nothing she buried her family with a silent rage building inside of her that was the night she never forgot she learned how cruel life can be to those who didnt ask it she held onto her rage she took what little money her family had buried in the yard purchased an old sword in poor condition and went into the forest looking for undead they would have to pay for what they had done as she was striding through the forest looking for anything to use her anger and hurt against a small band of bandits spotted her she realized through her rage that she had no chance at winning she tried to get away but they were faster and soon caught her even with low odds she fought them but they had the skill in swords that she lacked they quickly disarmed her as they were tying her up the undead that she had been looking for suddenly set upon the group in their fear the bandits never fully finished the knots on imaras wrists she fought and struggled against the ropes trying to get free and run with the undead closing in on her she gave a vicious snarl and ripped the ropes from her wrists drawing blood and skin away from her hands and ran for her life from the undead yet again after that encounter she realized she was not ready for revenge being in the country was her life but now she had no home and no way to protect herself she was able to move into the nearby village and live off the generosity of the people for awhile working for any money food and shelter she could she was a hard worker proficient in sewing caring for the villagers children and knowledgeable in farming she became involved in an orphanage helping care for the children whose parents had been taken from them just as they were from her after a time she took herself to the capital of vandregon and moved in with her sister and husband razel and stephan helping her with their home and shop she became the book keeper for stephan for very meager pay for a few years she made a simple living not letting anyone become too close but she paid attention to the terrible things happening in faedrun over time she worked on collecting some weapons and armor for she still wanted to get her revenge on the undead and to help stop evil from hurting the innocent in her spare time she would look for someone to help her learn how to fight the going was slow by then any able man or woman had already fled or was helping to fight the losing war against the undead times were hard even in vandregon food became hard to attain even with silver to pay for it no one was willing to go out of the cities gates to farm what little food they did have was given to the soldiers trying to keep the city from being sacked tired of constantly living on edge and worrying about the family she had left she begged her sister and brotherinlaw to take one of the few ships still going to a new land called mardrun imara had heard it was a new place where folks could start again a place with no undead around and families werent torn apart it was a long argument for her brotherinlaw did not want to leave he had a small business as a merchant and with supplies being so limited he enjoyed the raised prices at last his concern for his only daughter leah and the possibility of a bigger business with the new settlers that he finally decided to leave faedrun stephan spent most of his earnings to secure their passage on a ship the trip was hard and long scavengers and thieves took anything left out and food was hard to come by after the long journey they came to new hope in mardrun and imara felt hopeful for the first time since most of her family was killed in new hope the going was still rough it was a big city not many wanted to travel into the wilder places because of that there were a great number of merchants and stephan was displeased he decided that if he was going to make a living they needed to go to nearby villages that didnt have as many merchants razel didnt want to go into the wilderness anymore then they had too but agreed to her husband they packed up their belongings and started the trip their group was small and slow moving travel took several days as much as they tried to cover up their trail it attracted a small group of creatures the creatures caught up to them just as the town was in sight their group scattered and ran for the safety of the town the nasty creatures chased them there were a few big ones but mostly small ones crouched over almost slinking across the ground and they smelled badly of dirt and rotting meat mordok stephan tried to take as much of his belongings as he could carry slowing him down razel was holding and running with leah she yelled at him to drop it all and run a small mordok took advantage and came after stephan who was struggling under the weight of his greed and wares imara yelled at razel to get leah to the safety of the town as she grabbed a sword pulling it out of a dead mordok she stabbed the mordok as it attacked stephan the wounded mordok turned and pursued imara her knees turned weak as she fought the urge to turn and run with the rest of the travelers but she knew she had to keep it together until razel and leah could get to town then something strange happened her vision turned red her body flushed with heat and anger there was no way this mordok or any other was going to get past her and take all that was left of her family she raised the sword bellowed out a challenge and charged the already wounded mordok it flinched giving imara a small advantage and she took it her swordsmanship was clumsy at best but the mordok was young and already hurt it got a few good swipes at her cutting her upper arm and drawing blood on her calf but imara was relentless and kept swinging the sword until the mordok was down with a final grunt imara stabbed and killed it she looked up and saw the mordok were pulling back after half of their group had been killed by the travelers she helped the wounded into town but it was too late for stephan imara never forgot what it felt like to kill that mordok it was power power where she could really make a difference in this world that mordok she had slain was never going to kill anyone ever again since most of her family had been killed she was only surviving and nothing more she liked this new feeling it gave meaning to her otherwise drifting way of life no mordok werent the undead that had killed her family but she could help other families and she felt her father would approve of her choice telling razel was difficult she and leah were the only family she had left she wanted to make sure razel would be ok without her they moved her and leah back to new hope where the defenses were better and mordok attacks were few razel set up a shop as a seamstress and developed a good business imara refused to take any of razels money and set out with very few belongings in a foreign land this time her anger for revenge on evil burned she had heard of a group of adventurers where she could join other humans she hoped she could learn to fight and help take down any evil that stood in her way but she was also nervous for she had heard there was also ulven and syndar with them she has never seen them she only knew of them by stories and rumors was she really ready for this character update retired after serving alongside william of vandregon and helping the vandregon cause grow imara took a permanent position as a political representative and assistant to baroness katherine she now spends most of her time in the colony of newhope

captains activities i am known on the high seas as mordecai mad morty blackwaters i am captain of the fearsome blue ruby and her crew shes not the prettiest ship or the fastest but she should have sunk a few times by now and still sails on we were feared by merchant vessels and battle ships alike for we took no prisoners and gave no quarter our plans never went astray and we always ended up on top i remember a few months back we were docked in the village of oarsmeet once a quaint little fishing village now a wretched hive of scum and villainy we fit right in as we were docked though a group of rival pirates from that damned graybeards ship stowed away in our hull hiding in crates and barrels until we shoved off when we were all asleep they burst out slaughtered my crew to a man signalled their ship not far from us then boarded and pillaged what was left of our rightfully stolen booty i myself was dragged from my bed tied to their anchor and dropped overboard as i saw them burn my precious ship to cinders when the ruby made port the next week we once again unloaded our cargo onto any fence willing to pay us this time however we made sure to check the hull before returning to the great blue mistress of fate then there were the bloody syndar oh the stories i could tell of those flighty little bastards alas those are different stories for a different time right now were talking about me we were back in oarsmeet after another successful raid our hull packed to bursting with the pelts of many a young squirrel prepared to sell the furs an aldorian war ship appeared on the horizon heading straight for the dock well thats not good my first mate remarked at least its just a ship its not like they brought an army or something my knife found his heart and he fell to the floor but i was too late i heard the distant thunder felt the ground shake under thousands of boots now i shouted to my crew standing on the dead mans chest anyone else feel like tempting fate i ran outside expecting to look over the hill and see lines of aldorian soldiers green and blue flags flapping in the wind what i saw through my telescope was much more unnerving lines of men and women in peasant clothes holding makeshift weapons and shields a black line down every cheek throughout the mass were disgusting creatures once living men now their flesh had been rotten showing the bones beneath jaws and fingers were missing and they trudged forward with eerie determination i looked back to the sea for once hoping to see the aldorian navy closing in but all that had approached was a small dinghy with six figures on it the main war ship turned at sailed away when the dinghy ran aground i saw a young woman in leather armour start calling orders to the sailors who had joined her on the shore they rounded up all the villagers they could find barricading them in the town hall next they set about finding all of able body and arming them with swords and shields finally the woman went around the village finding the owners of any ships in the harbour they meant to abandon the town and evacuate all of the residents naturally i decided not to speak up as the locals began filing out of the town hall and towards the docks one of the sailors gave a shout the penitent are attacking prepare yourselves the villagers ran to the ships as any who resolved to stand and fight advanced toward the oncoming army the woman started calling out commands to the men and launching arrows across the field i decided that perhaps it was time to do some good for a change so i ordered my men to join me as we stood with the other villagers against the foe swords and spears were drawn and clashed against the penitent shields we killed many men in the fight but alas my crew was simply overwhelmed by the sheer number of the enemy every soldier and fighter who stood to delay the attack was cut down slaughtered to a man ships were shoving off from the dock but most were too late of the twelve anchored near the village only 5 made it clear of the dock and two more of those were burnt down by flaming arrows even my precious blue ruby was not spared a massive man with a bigger axe chopping his way through her hull until she sank i was run through as i watched my love slip below the surface of the water a single tear falling from my right eye    no wait i had the patch on the right eye that day so it was my left eye yes from my left eye the next morning when i awoke aboard the blue ruby we were well on our way to the new continent a place called mardrun lieutenant cash as she called herself was taking control quite nicely a little too nicely for my taste this was my ship after all relationships captain of the aldorian pirates rumors mad morty is probably not the most

my father and i he taught me how to sail how to shoot and how to survive on my own not so with my mother she was always upset that i would rather be dirty than pretty youll never find a husband if you look like a pigsty she used to tell me she would yell and i responded in kind i slipped on the dock i would lie to people the sea spray leaves the planks slick i should really be more careful my father was not only my only real friend but also my protector my mothers rage could be cooled in an instant by his calming words but such a good thing can never last one evening shortly after my twelfth birthday when we were out checking our snares for rabbits my father and i were spotted by a large silver wolf seeing a threat to his free meal the wolf lunged at my father who could only barely reach his dagger before the beast sank its teeth into his neck i fell too many times to count as i fled through the forest tears burning my eyes branches stinging my skin as i broke through the brush at the edge of the woods i collapsed in a quivering heap i was bleeding from a small gash in my forehead and countless other cuts on my arms chest and legs tomas a city guard and a good friend was making his daily patrol as he came across me he dropped his shield and spear reaching my side before they hit the ground i felt his arms around me as he lifted me off the ground carrying me back to the guards station to settle down he was still a young man only twenty years old but his strength and size always reminded me of an oak tree he wrapped his cloak around me and offered me some milk which i finished all too quickly when my breathing had evened out and my tears had dried he asked me what had happened my father i started feeling another wave of sadness coming he was attacked by a great wolf i was so scared i just ran tears flowed freely now stinging as they ran over scrapes on my cheek your father was a good man and a better friend he practically raised me too tomas said fighting back the tears i could see welling in his eyes well come on then lets get you home annie no i cant go home what why not im sure your mother is worried sick about you she doesnt care about me she didnt even care about my father all she loved was his money and title she was only nice to me when he was around if he had seen the things she did to me while he was away she would have lost everything i shouted ashamed that i had spoken so terribly of my mother but relieved to have finally told someone of her wickedness well im sorry annie but the guardhouse is no place for a little girl even one as scrappy as you he explained messing my hair is there anyone else you can go to i stared so intently at the floor one might have thought i was trying to dig a hole with my vision alone only you tomas i mumbled only you i love you annie youre like a sister to me you know that but this i could be tried for kidnapping if they found out i wont take you back to your mother and ill try to keep an eye on you but im sorry theres really nothing more i can do he sounded defeated tomas was a good man with a good heart but he was a soldier through and through and disobeying the law like this was so out of character for him that i couldnt expect him to do even as much as he already had for me thank you tomas ill never forget this i whispered in his ear as i hugged his waist with a final wave goodbye i ran from the guardhouse and returned to the edge of the wood from which i had emerged strewn across the ground were several of my things an old leather pouch i would keep rations in while hunting half a dozen simple arrows most of which were broken and the bow my father had given me when i was still learning how to shoot the bow was beautiful in its simplicity a slight recurve on each end molded over the years to fit my palm like a glove hickory wrapped in tan suede to keep the wood warm and dry during the cold wet months it was the one piece of my father i still had everything else being left at our home where i would have to confront my mother i pushed my fear to the back of my mind taking my first steps back into the forest where my father had only hours ago been slain before my very eyes every shadow was a ghost every tree a demon looking to bring about my end but still i pushed on fearful of the alternative let the demons have me i thought their hell can be no worse that what i would face at my mothers hands after an hour of walking i came across a small clearing by a creek and decided to stop and rest i climbed a nearby tree and started drifting off with plans of the future dancing through my vision tonight i would sleep tomorrow i would find a way to live out here as i rubbed the sleep from my eyes in the early hours of the morning i was greeted by a familiar sound faint though it was a young deer had made its way into my clearing stopping for a drink from the creek feeling the emptiness of my rations pouch i knew what needed to be done i silently grabbed my bow and nocked an arrow praying that the wrappings would keep the wood from creaking time seemed to stop for a moment as i lined up my shot i held my breath and released the arrow lodging itself deep between the creatures ribs it fell with a lifeless thud and i dropped from my perch in the tree to examine my shot i smiled wide knowing my father would have been proud of me for such perfect placement although i knew it was luck and that i would never be able to do it again in a million years as i looked at my kill my heart sank for a moment i had no knife to clean the bones no rope to string the carcass up and out of the reach of predators and no money to pay for any of these items my mind was racing trying to formulate a plan but the only option that came to mind scared me to even think about my fathers dagger the one he used to fight the great silver wolf i spent the day trying to work out another way something else that would keep me from returning to that grizzly scene as night fell i realized that soon i would have no other choice food would not be easily gotten and a knife would be worth its weight in gold in the forest i climbed my tree again and waited until morning to set off in search of my father that he might once again save my life something big came during the night the deer i had shot had been dragged away taking one of my two good arrows with it by the time i could have gotten to it there likely would have been nothing but bones left and i had more pressing matters to see to i had been hunting in these woods for as long as i can remember and knew them like the grip of my bow it wasnt long before i had approached the scene of my fathers demise bow in hand i slid my last remaining arrow from my quiver and nocked it prepared to fire at a moments notice i felt on overwhelming sense of fear as i neared my fathers body as if something wasnt quite right although i couldnt quite put my finger on it as hard as i tried to steel my resolve against the sight i knew awaited me nothing could prepare me for the aftermath of the struggle with the wolf my father or what was left of him lay pale and lifeless on the ground his eyes frozen in an eternal agonizing scream one his stoic face would not allow to pass his lips even on the brink of death his throat was completely missing torn out by the beasts massive jaws claw marks had torn through his tunic and deep into his chest a now dry pool forming beneath him on his belt was tied an old lantern with a few matches lashed to the bottom in one hand he held a tuft of silver fur a memento from his fight with the wolf in his other hand the hand which drew the daggernothing his ring and coin purse were still in place so he was not looted by a passing thief i searched the area wondering if the dagger had been cast aside during the fight to no avail where could this knife be i was hit then by a wave of emotions rage at the wolf for taking my father from me and at any gods listening for taking the dagger from him sadness for the loss of my father made ever more poignant by his proximity to me but most of all i felt shame i had practically looted my dead father and was furious over the loss of his dagger almost as furious as i was over his death the emotions tore at my body and mind and soon i had fallen to my knees resting my head on the bloodstained torso of the man who was once my closest friend to this day i thank the light or arnath or whoever it was who caused the light to play exactly as it had a glint of a sunbeam peeked through the trees and reflected off a puddle of stilldrying blood just as i rose to clear my eyes i cant believe i hadnt seen it while i was searching for the knife too far from my father to be his this was a trail of blood faint but certainly there leading away from his corpse i ran back to grab my bow and the lantern set my arrow and followed the trail as quickly as my exhausted legs would carry me following the blood for hours i finally came to the mouth of a small cave at the foot of a large hill cautiously i inched my way down into the darkness slipping twice despite my efforts i lit the lantern and strung it through my belt causing shadows to dance along the walls the light made my quest easier by far not only allowing me to avoid loose rocks and keep my footing but gleaming off small drops of blood on the floor i otherwise would have missed the cave was deceptively small although i walked through in the dim light bow at the ready for a little over half an hour when i happened upon a sight that made my blood boil laying on the floor in front of me was the great silver wolf that had only days ago slain my father in front of me my fathers dagger protruding from his flank still oozing crimson from the fight i had made no attempt at stealth as i approached and the beast turned to look at me admitting defeat with his striking green eyes he would die soon he knew and had accepted his fate i could feel him pleading with me to end his suffering i was more than happy to oblige although mercy was second to revenge in my mind i drew my arrow back and let fly sinking it deep into the wolfs haunches far from a killing shot tears of fury streamed down my cheek as i walked up to the wolf roughly seizing the dagger from its side time and time again i plunged the now dripping knife into the beasts neck long after i knew it had died this was my closure although afterwards i felt more empty than ever every stab drained a little of my resolve until i dropped the dagger and sobbed again it was morning before i had the strength to move again my lantern had gone out but sunlight still filtered into the cave taking the dagger from its resting place next to the dead wolf i washed it in a small pool near the back of the cave wiping it clean on the wolfs pelt i tucked the knife into my belt tore my last arrow from the beasts thigh and proceeded to leave the cave as i emerged a warm summer breeze brushed my face and i realized just how refreshingly cool the cave was with one way in and out it could easily become a new home for me certainly more stable than the tree in which i had been sleeping now was not the time for worrying about shelter though now was the time to hunt as i had not eaten since tomas found me outside the woods i drew my bow and set off into the forest once again more than a year had passed since i took my vengeance upon the wolf who had slain my father i was just over thirteen years old now and had honed my skills to better survive in the forest i had become a wonder with my bow learned how to clean and dress my wounds and a few simple snares to use after weeks of trial and error i figured out how to make my own arrows they were by no means pretty but they flew straight enough throughout it all always at my side was that dagger the one used to end the wolf the last thing my father held before he died as good as i was though there were things i could not make or find on my own i had tried my hand at clothing although the result was pathetic at best bandages were hard to come by and were used often as life alone in the forest can be dangerous eventually seeing no other options i decided to return to town to see what i could find there i made my way to the edge of the woods outside of town and looked around for any signs of movement sure enough a few guards were on patrol so i waited until they had passed to make my way to the town the town hadnt changed much since i left and i quickly found my way to the marketplace i managed to hold on to a few coins before i ran away that i used to pay for the essentials stocking up on arrows a basic tunic as mine had grown too small in the past year and was in a horrible state of disrepair and purchasing a length of rope by the time i had run out of coins i realized that i had forgotten to buy food venison and berries start to get old after a while and i would have killed for some bread or an apple desperate for a change in diet i told myself i would do what it would take to get what i need i approached the stand of a local baker and waited as soon as her back was turned my hand darted for a small loaf of bread mere inches away from my goal my hand was stopped a firm grasp held my wrist fast struggle as i might to break free i looked up to confront the one who would stop me but stopped when i met his face the eyes of a friend watered when they saw me the little girl he had thought dead aannie tomas asked incredulously youve been gone for a year we all thought you were my hand slipped from his grasp as he tried to wrap his head around the situation i told you i couldnt go home tomas come with me we should get you out of here i cant stay tomas what if someone finds me what if they try to make me go back to my mother well at least let me help you here he pressed a small pouch into my hand ive been saving for a new sword but i think you need it more than i do besides im joining the navy soon they pay better than the guards anyway tomas i cant youve done so much for me already it just wouldnt be right annie youve lost your father you wont go to your mother youve been living alone for a year and youre what twelve im thirteen thank you just take the money annie get some food get a sack go somewhere since you apparently cant stay here just please take care of yourself tomas go thats an order annie as i turned to leave i glanced back at my friend his back was to me but i could see in the hunch of his shoulders that he was crying i walked back to him and hugged his waist just as i had the last time we parted ways yes sir two years had passed since i last left aldoria with tomass coins in hand i had managed to feed myself well coming into town every few weeks to load up on food and make repairs to my equipment i did however also learn how to not get caught when acquiring things that werent mine in the technical sense it was always my style to learn how to do something before there was a need in order for it to be a second nature by the time it was required if tomas knew that i had been stealing food and the occasional arrows from the armory he would have had my head on a platter for those two years i had only been taking what i needed although i soon decided that i would try to find the money to move to a different city where my survival wouldnt rely on a bow shot or sticky fingers as a result i took to taking small items of value small rings the occasional coin purse and the like i would hide them away in my cave bringing them into town long after they had ceased being missed to find a buyer i dont know what possessed me to step up my game going from picking pockets to sneaking into a store at night but i did it was the shop of a candlemaker new in town but wellliked by his customers i waited until after nightfall and approached the shop through an alley behind the building took out my picks and quickly opened the lock as i stepped inside my eyes darted from piece to piece trying to size up the most expensive item i could take without raising much of an alarm a noise behind me caused me to jump and i spun around dagger in hand to be met by the clouded eyes of the shop owners old guard dog now just a shell of its former self i relaxed and sheathed my dagger walking up to an elegant silver candlestick my fingers wrapped around it but as soon as it cleared the table on which it rested my world went black i awoke who knows how much later bound to a chair in the shop the shop owner stood in front of me a solid plank of wood in hand only after managing to put two and two together did i notice the dull throbbing pain in my head well look what weve got ere he said talking to his dog but pointing at me weve caught us a thief whaddya fink we shoul do wif er brute the dog gave no response which was enough for the shopkeeper yeh i sppose yer right th guards ken deal wif is one but firs he approached me a slight limp in his right leg how the hell did this man sneak up on me i didnt have time to think about it any more though as he plank he held slammed into my temple again sending me back into darkness i didnt know where i was or how long i had been out all i knew was that it was dark and i was wet as i groaned against the shock of the cold water another wave splashed my face a lantern was lit and i saw three shadowy figures standing before me one holding the bucket used to assail me with water wwhere am i i asked fearing the worst shut up bitch the one with the bucket responded im tied to this chair pretty tight im not going anywhere the least you can do is tell me where i amunless youre afraid that information will help me that is the man dropped the bucket and raised his hand to strike me only to be stopped by the man in the center gentle with this one the voice said and my heart sank alliston take boris outside and get him some air let him cool down for a while tomass voice was more confident than i remembered it being and less gentle i can handle her as the two others left the room tomas pulled a chain up in front of me and sat down i could not bring myself to meet his gaze for i knew how disappointed in me he was what the hell annie stealing really your father raised you better than that what happened to the money i gave you a tear rolled down my cheek shame burning my face into a bright crimson hue i cant get you out of it this time you understand that youre in trouble and theres no one who can come to rescue you im sorry annie but this is on you tomas wait he didnt im sorry tomas i let you down i called to him as he stepped into the door frame he paused for just a moment yes you did with that he was gone the day of my trial arrived sooner than i had expected normally the penalty for a first offense of burglary was simply jail time and a substantial fine due to the weapons found on me my fathers bloodstained dagger a pair of throwing knives and a short sword i had managed to sneak out of the towns armory during one of my more recent trips it was assumed that i was there for more than just loot the severity of this crime led the prosecutors to push instead for a more severe punishment with the kinder ones asking only to have my hands removed as i was brought before the judge in the rags of a prisoner hands bound behind me i knew that i was finished i had been caught and tomas was right there was no getting out of this one even if all they took from me was my hands i would no longer be able to hunt to feed myself and would die soon enough i fought back the tears for as long as i could but it was no use by the time the trial had started i was a convulsing heap of flesh dirt and shame on behalf of the kingdom of aldoria i the honorable judge reichert shall now hear from both plaintiff and defendant in this case the judge began plaintiff present your case oy sure ting yer honor ere i was sleepin in me room above me store i hear ol brute me trusty guard dog get up and ead downstairs now e normally dont do at so i were a mite suspicious i grabbed me plank and went downstairs jus as quiet as a mouse yer

zactly ow it appened yer honor i had managed to stop crying by this point although underneath my calm facade i was screaming despicable the judge spat a knife on a dog what have you to say for yourself miss cash anne cash cash you wouldnt happen to be the daughter of henry cash would you that was my fathers name yes what does that have to do with anything nothing my dear but he was an old friend we served together in a few battles my condolences i heard he had passed away when you were younger with all due respect your honor id rather not talk about my father it still a sensitive subject for me of course do you have anything to say on your behalf miss cash i dont suppose an apology will cut it at this point  ell no it wont off wif er ands off wif er ands the candlemaker tried to convince others in the gathered crowd to join his chant order i said order the judge shouted over the rising chorus i have made my decision miss cashs life could easily be taken for her crime it will not however be taken this day or by this court her life is forfeit and the court will enforce her punishment a lifetime in prison as penance for her sins or a life of servitude to our country i hear commander ridgebon could use another deckhand the choice is yours miss cash after the trial the judge returned to his home near the courthouse as he sat at his table he looked towards the heavens and quietly said to himself there henry now were even i quickly became a fixture aboard the ias interceptor a relatively small ship in the aldorian navy they gave me a set of leather armor and were more than happy to supply me with arrows i could shoot which helped turn the tide of more than one battle raining arrows from the crows nest this skill was proven all the more useful when we went ashore when i would return with fresh meat to fill our stomachs i had much to learn from the ships medic though my willingness to absorb his teachings shocked him and i progressed quickly i even came to replace the ships cook much to the relief of all on board i will say this of the cook he had a remarkable ability he could prepare any dish imaginable with what he called the four basic food groups beans bacon whiskey and lard sure it all ended up as the same grayishbrown paste but everyone had simply learned to not argue anymore when he told them it was cod or beef stew or a salad our ship had an important task we were to hunt down the pirates that frequented the local waters and send them to the briny deep we were good at our job too my first month at sea we sank three pirate vessels saving many more merchant ships from meeting with a salty wet fate the second month we destroyed five of the ships all under the watchful eye of commander jackston ridgebon he was a brave and handsome man fair in his dealings with the crew and forceful in a fight i wont lie and say that i never developed any feelings for the man but i was just a lowly deck hand and he was a commander he was also a dozen years my senior i was still just a little girl in his eyes after a year or so on the ship my history was finally revealed to this new family of mine i had become like a daughter or a little sister to most of them and they wanted to know more about me i told them of my father and his fight with the wolf i described my mother although i may have embellished a few of the warts i told them of my time in the forest of tomas and of how i got caught and thats how i ended up here looking back i dont know if i would have changed a thing i had noticed early on that the commander was almost unnervingly interested in my story when i was finished and our medic was telling his tales of past battles commander ridgebon placed his hand on my shoulder and asked me to meet him in his chambers i followed him trying to avoid as many curious eyes as possible because i knew what this looked like when i entered his cabin he offered me a chair and told me to sit he was pacing trying to find the right words commander i just wanted you to know if this is about the thievery those days are hold on anne youre not in trouble its just that iwell i knew your father well great i thought another fan of my father opening up that old wound youve been with us for what a year now youve certainly shown me that you can handle yourself better than most of the men on this ship i also owed your father a favor before he commander ridgebon started to trail off sir is everything okay he was troubled and i wanted to go to him but was frozen in his chair he shook the emotions from his mind then looked back at me yes everything is fine miss cash he pulled something out from his coat although i couldnt quite make out the shape or should i say ensign cash he held out the item to me it was a small pin denoting my new rank i thanked him several times and each time he laughed saying i had earned it and that my father would be proud i saluted him and spun to return to the rest of the crew i was met with whoops and shouts some congratulating me others asking me how many times i had been in his chambers before i got the promotion i heard none of them for i was on top of the world a year had passed since my promotion i was seventeen now and had grown into a woman my archery had been honed even more although with my new leadership position i was forced to learn discipline and the commander kept us on a tight schedule today we were to make port in the small town of waves edge to investigate rumors of pirates among the locals as we dropped anchor and prepared a small rowboat to go ashore the lieutenant and i both volunteered to go with a small crew having the utmost confidence in us the commander sent us both ashore with three other sailors each dressed in light armor and armed with a simple sword i of course wore my leather and carried my bow in hand dagger in my belt as we made the pier we ran through the same process as we always had one sailor would jump out and help another out of the boat one of them would tie us to the dock as the other would watch his back in case of an ambush when that was finished they pulled the others ashore i was the last to leave the boat bow in hand for cover fire should anything go wrong when we were all on the dock we noticed a distinct lack of commotion normally our visits were met by some excitement good or bad there was always movement the men were uneasy but were trained to do their job we advanced as a unit towards the town two sailors in front then the lieutenant then me and the third sailor behind as we approached the center of the town we finally heard something although it was far from what we had hoped for a young girl screamed from inside an old warehouse nearby i nocked an arrow and bolted for the door determined to save this poor child my crew mates called for me to wait to let them go first but i didnt have time for that and neither did the girl i threw the door open and ran inside seeing nothing but old crates thats when the door behind me slammed shut and i heard the dulled thud of a bar being placed across it the windows were boarded and the warehouse was in darkness i heard feet shuffling and shouts from outside anne anne they called to me but a hand from the shadows closed over my mouth before i could respond another pair of strong hands pulled me to the ground held me down as i was bound at the wrists and ankles bloody pimmph i tried to yell as a rag was forced into my mouth oy shes a mouthy one capn a short mousy man said grabbing my chin not the prettiest but its been a while can we keep er aye i sppose that would be proper go take her out back lou i struggled against my bonds as i was lifted from the floor and thrown over a surprisingly muscular shoulder he walked saying nothing soon we were back outside through a side door on the building just as with the light glinting of the drops of blood that led me to the wolf a higher power must have been looking out for me as the lieutenant managed to spot the man leaving the building with me over his shoulder and gave chase with the others not far behind the man practically a giant noticed his pursuers and dropped me to draw his sword i groaned at the fall although i managed to work my dagger out from my belt to start to cut my bonds the man had incredible form dodging and parrying every swing from his four assailants occasionally lunging forward to strike although it never amounted to more than a small scrape snap my hands were free and i started on my legs the sailors pressed harder trying to bring this massive foe down snap my legs were free now too i looked up at the battle raging over me just in time to see the man raise his sword over his head with both hands two sailors ran him through but it was too little too late the sword came slamming down on the lieutenants skull splitting it with a sickening crunch i screamed and lunged at the man plunging my dagger into the back of his knee then prying his own sword free of the lieutenant making a clean slice across his massive throat the lieutenant and i had never been very close but he was a good man with a family waiting for him back home someone would have to tell his wife that she was now a widow everything had happened so fast i fell to my knees in shock one of the sailors managed to grab me and carry me in an all out run back to the rowboat as another grabbed the body of the lieutenant we were pursued but only to the pier as the sailors pushed their limbs to row ever faster only when we were back aboard the ship did i realize i still had the mans sword in my hand it was beautiful blade solid black with a falcons head carved into the pommel a wicked curve near the end made it flow like water i decided i would keep the sword for the lieutenant and to remind myself to be more cautious in the future the commander approached me asked me what the hell had happened out there i moved to speak but instead collapsed into his chest and waited for his embrace well he started wrapping one of his arms around my shoulders i know its a bad time but looks like were in need of a new lieutenantplayed by tyler s dubey character

the word a drop of liquid a puff of smoke a plume of dust all of these can inspire fear which makes sense any of those that i mentioned could kill anyone from a farmer to an emperor which may explain my childhood a childhood routed in death torture and that sweet mysterious word that brings fear to entire countries i was born not to any family i was simply born and abandoned left to live in squalor in the streets of the capitals shadow it wasnt till i was about five that the other street waste and myself were rounded up and herded to a building in the countryside you all have been given a glorious chance to serve the royal family if you decide to agree you will be given food a home and even a job said the officials they were not lying but they for sure never told us what we would be doing for the next eight years would have been nothing but horror to a normal being we were used as test subjects for poison addiction magical torture healing and the study of disease in the first year out of the thousand that were brought in 749 died a painful agonizing death those of us who remained we continued our pitiful station as mere playthings for the alchemists who worked for the vandregonian royal family after three more years only fifty of us remained by this time i had started to develop a resistance to the poisons they were issuing to me but there was another talent a talent i kept hidden for the better part of a year i could taste it the different ingredients yes the flavors became so familiar to me over the years that i could tell what was different and what was similar this secret became public when they looked in my chamber carefully they found that i was recording the poisons i was subjected to of course they were not happy at first and i was punished to the point of physical impairment my left eye became so damaged by the magical poisons that all it can see out of it is now in shades of grey to top this pain off they made sure i would never forget hiding such information from them again they tore away my identity as a male and turned me into a eunuch after this event i began to show potential to handle arcane magic maybe it was due to the trauma maybe it was always within me i may never know the truth of its origin i am however thankful for the change in my body for it got me out of the bowels of that experiment in return i was seated with a rather respected alchemist and mage that helped out the guards of the royal family it is during that time that i was really able to begin to hone my skills for the art of alchemy i finally was able to put names to the ingredients that i could taste in each concoction that he showed and allowed me to sample the feelings of joy during those days were countless the learning the experimenting on solutions mixtures antidotes poisons all of it precious to me at one point i believe i was about nearing twenty we got word of some terrible news we had to evacuate and run to the port however on our way to the port my master and myself got separated from the flow of the crowd by a swarm of undead the horror the terror the beauty i never seen something so interesting and mystifying we had to run and we ran for sometime before we got to safety the safety of aldoria during the frequent travels from village to village my master finally gave into both exhaustion and old age i did him the favor and burned him after his death not before i took all of his notes and journals that he kept hoarding i finally made my way to an aldorian boat and snuck onto it knowing it was heading to this new place that people kept trying to go to i then found myself in the colonies a place of hopeless people having to fight to survive i didnt do much during this time other than sell some potions from time to time but when the war ended that changed i began to set up shop in some gods forsaken alleyway in new hope it is here that i ply my trade and study my passions my passions of alchemy particularly poison being the fruits of my hard labor yes that funny and fearful word that brought me such pain is now my obsession and my most profitable item people would come from all over the city and sometimes from the other colonies for my products all of those people came for different reasons some to save others some to save themselves others to make other suffer sometimes even kill them i gladly provided them what they needed and do so to this very day so that is why i am here my good patron so what can zhao cao bi do to make your dreams come true please note that the above may or may

thing forgotten i never saw my home my true home of nara pentare but i often hear of the colorful cities and beautiful mountains the way the grass would flow with the wind and how you couldnt go ten feet without something new catching your eye i was born in aldoria after my parents escaped the undead the safety didnt last long though i remember hearing the screams and seeing the fear in everyones eyes as if it flowed like a river into an ocean and left no room for hope i could hear more and more the clanking of metal and cries of anger and less and less of sweet laugher and music i saw the houses in flames and the ashes dancing on the wind i try to remember as much as i can but at the same time i dont want to my life became blurred once i saw death it happened all at once at first i had only heard of the undead my parents were far from the port cities so they had to go over the mountains and across the continent to escape people said we were safe here that aldoria and vandregon were strong and would save us i couldnt tell if they believed it themselves or said it to convince the young it wasnt long before things were different before the stories stopped altogether along with the art dancing and my favorite music with remaining culture of the nations slowing dying people lost hope eventually the undead reached us and no wall could stop that we were lucky enough to be close to a port this time the journey wasnt long but our feet didnt stop with death nipping at our heels when we got there we realized there was hope the ships were loading up with people in lines to get on my parents soon realized that there were limits on how many people were let on we would not get spots so my parents did something terribly dishonorable for a nara pentarian they paid a family to pretend i was one of theirs and take me with them i guess desperate times make desperate people because the family did it although i dont think they liked my kind i hate remembering my past and i try locking it away in my mind in a room with the key lost and a keyhole that darkness creeps from allowing no light to be seen but the darkness tortures me with the fact that while i ignore it the best i can i can still remember my parents screams and the sound of their flesh being torn apart a time later we arrived at the new home with the few nara pentare that didnt go with the rest i became an orphan the moment i stepped foot on mardrun since the family that claimed me as their child during the trip wanted nothing to do with me i lived on the streets of new hope finding out what makes happiness in people and trying to get a hold of anything from the old world that i could when i became of age i worked small jobs until i gained enough coin to buy a djembe pretty much an artifact from the old world at this point and then took to the road i dont like staying in one place but luckily i wasnt alone i made a friend on the road and we traveled as a duo playing everywhere from semigrand halls to small town taverns life was good but naturally it couldnt last one day while traveling a road near the mountains we were ambushed by bandits money or life my friend chose to fight and i chose to run the price of survival was his life another person for the locked room in my head and i was determined to keep it shut this time i used my remaining coin to purchase alcohol to blur the keyhole but it also blurred the lines of my music though one day a child seeing my drum asked me for a song it was the first time i denied the bottle so i could bring happiness to the boy the smile on his face when i played him my song the young boy reminded me why i got this drum to begin with it wasnt to make money i became a bard to make sure that we dont forget where we came from i do it to bring hope to those who have none to create light where there is only darkness i will not let the old world die with its heroes and history i am zeke ravana and this is not the endplayed by kallie bain name wren duncan gender female race human age 21 class rogue wren duncan i never thought id end up where i am today when i was a child i was sure id have a home of my own once i reached adulthood i knew back then that i wanted two things out of this life to be the best swordfighter in all the land although of course back then i was thinking of a different land and to have a family well here i am i will always have room to improve my swordwork and i have still not managed to find anything approaching a family when i was hardly older than 3 my father died while fighting in the vandregon army i have no memories of him but feel i missed a chance that many other people had a chance to have a loving father who could guide me through my early years and provide support in the later ones my mother was no more help she passed not long after my father having caught a strange disease at a time when we had no money to hire a healer i was left alone in a world i could hardly understand but learned enough to survive fairly quickly living on the streets one cant afford to learn survival skills slowly i learned that watching and listening were the best ways to discover anything whether that be information or new techniques for blade work i learned how to kill with a single jab of a knife by watching another man do so it took me a few tries to get it right but eventually i found the precise spot then expanded my knowledge from there my true passion became the sword the stealth required for knifework has never really appealed to me mostly because i am incredibly clumsy when care is required but the longsword i knew after my first time climbing the wall of the training yard to watch the soldiers that was my weapon i cannot say to this day what about it drew me in but i couldnt imagine ever wielding another type of blade quite as well or with as much pleasure after the first day i decided to return every morning to watch the soldiers train and every afternoon i would find a long heavy stick to practice with replicating what i had observed that day as best i could i practiced my sword fighting in this way for about two months before accidentally receiving professional training it shouldnt have happened at all the only reason landon faulken ever found me was through my own singleminded swinging of that stick it was general practice among the children of the streets to flee the area when a soldier turned up but on this particular afternoon i was practicing a challenging feint on a post and didnt notice the children melting back into the shadows or the man in red and gray striding up the street hand resting on the hilt of his sword so intent was i on my exercise that it took me several seconds to register the fact that that same man had come to a halt some ten feet away and was watching my determined attempts to beat the post into submission i stepped back glaring at the post and glanced around finally noticing the soldier nearby i froze ready to bolt if he tried to come any closer but he raised his hand off his swordhilt in what i took to be a gesture of peace i still didnt relax of course but i was now willing to wait and hear this man out at least until i stopped liking what i heard child the man began that is a rather crude weapon i glared at him however you wield it well of course there are huge flaws in your stance and technique but those could be rectified with a bit of proper training he was smiling seeming to invite me to do  something was he suggesting what i thought he was suggesting come with me child he said gently ill get you some food and clean clothes then perhaps we can see about equipping you with a worthy weapon i regarded him warily sorely tempted by his offer of food and a weapon although at this point in my life i could hardly care less about my state of cleanliness i was so encrusted with dirt from the streets that hardly an inch of skin could be seen i considered for a long moment finally deciding i would never get a better chance to learn proper sword fighting i nodded once and the soldier smiled again a kind smile nothing hidden in his gentle open face i didnt trust him not yet this could still be some sort of trap some strange effort to rid the city of another homeless child i wanted to believe that this man was really going to teach me though i wanted to believe he would feed and clothe and care for me so i followed him back to his modest home which looked like a castle to me at that point and allowed him to guide me inside hand on my knife the whole way but only as a precaution not because i really wanted to use it his wife drew a large amount of very hot water into a brass tub and scrubbed me down until the water was black and my raw pink skin could be seen beneath the grime of years it took a total of three baths to get me completely clean which was just about the least enjoyable experience i had gone through at that point as well as a very long attack upon my very long hair which hadnt seen a comb since my mother had died finally i was clean and dressed in clothes that were quite a bit too big for me belonging to the son of the baker who lived next door i was grateful the soldier didnt try to force me into a dress as one of us would not have survived that experience as i soon discovered that someone would most likely have been me landon it transpired was a superb sword fighter at least to my untrained eye and mind not to mention limbs by the end of our first training session i felt as though every muscle in my body was made of rubber over time though i became used to the motions of the short practice sword he insisted i begin with my body adjusted to the actions and soon they became almost instinctive landon was a mentor to me always kind when talking to me demanding on the training field jubilant when i mastered some particularly challenging move i respected and trusted him more than any other person before or since i dont think he ever really understood me but he seemed to be alright with that after the first week or so he stopped asking questions knowing he would get oneword answers at best or more often no answer at all at first i kept my secrets to myself hardly speaking at all lest he learn something about me beyond what he did through having me under his roof by the end of our time together i like to think i would have answered any question he asked me but he was always polite and never pried into my past how i wish there were more people like landon faulken but all good things as they say must come to an end with the undead hordes ever growing landon was called out to fight for vandregon he went away for long periods of time only coming home for brief visits perhaps once a year for the next three or four years eventually the army of the undead was at the gates and pressing forward landon told me to go with the other women and children to flee in the ships headed to the new continent but in my 10yearold stubbornness i insisted upon staying with him for the battle i remember telling him i can fight what was all the training for if not to battle opposing armies he was still unhappy about it but for his own reasons allowed me to stay perhaps he could already sense the weakness inside of me perhaps he already knew i would run perhaps he saw that i would give in to the fear inside of me let it control me allow it to take over my limbs my brain my very soul and cause me to flee perhaps he knew even then that i was horribly despicably weak after that day i swore never to run from a fight again not without trying first i never found out what happened to landon but i have a guess and i might have been able to prevent it if i had just stayed beside him theres a part of me a logical little voice that says if you had stayed you would be dead too or worse undead but i still feel somehow responsible this mental argument has tormented me for years ever since i came back to my senses on that boat to mardrun and my new home our ship landed in davens reach after what seemed like years at sea although it was probably only a few months i was seasick the whole time having to run up on deck to vomit over the side every few minutes since then ive avoided sea travel as much as possible only having to set foot on two ships in the last ten years and then only briefly i lived in davens reach for several years working as a blacksmith and learning everything i could about the new society the colonists were building here on mardrun i left after the city was overrun with bandits though not wanting to live with those people on my doorstep since then ive been acting as a mercenary of sorts although i like to think i have more honour than most mercenaries protecting caravans and nobles when i cant find work i steal but only out of necessity it seems dishonourable but it keeps me alive so i suppose its worth that shame wren is not a trusting person shell be very unwilling to say even a few words until shes watched you interact with others for a while she doesnt really know how to handle new people if she doesnt feel she knows enough about how they talk and act to find this out she takes to sitting on the edges of rooms or camps and staring at each person present for several minutes watching their actions listening to their speech patterns learning as much as she can about them before they even notice she exists when people do notice her staring many are unnerved and look away quickly while others will try to hold her gaze in an attempt to make her move on to someone else wren will continue to stare whether the other picks the first or second option refusing to look away whenever she feels as though things are getting too lighthearted or frivolous she will turn and leave not looking back or telling anyone where she intends to go this last is generally because she has no particular destination in mind she leaves because she despises immaturity and excessive displays of cheer she will wander for a while perhaps practice with her sword a bit then return when things have calmed down it doesnt make her angry its just a mild irritation when people start being very loud wren likes to use all of her senses and is perhaps a little paranoid she always expects an attack and uses more than just her eyes to locate any possible dangers therefore loud noisespeople put her on edge because there is always a chance their noise is concealing an approaching bandit she also dislikes the tradition of building a campfire every evening believing it to be a hindrance to her ability to see in the dark in the winter her desire for night vision is often outweighed by her need for warmth and comfort but in the summer she will remain on the edges of the firelight staring out into the surrounding terrain wren usually shows very little emotion preferring to hide what she feels behind a tough mask of blankness she very rarely laughs this could become something of a game when in the company of certain people that is attempting to make her laugh and tends to take sarcasm literally becoming disgruntled when she finds out it was just a joke again it generally takes quite a lot to provoke her because she has had so much practice controlling her emotions but when someone does manage to anger her she goes very quiet and still glaring at her provoker her hand will clench around the hilt of her sword prepared to draw it if she is given a reason no matter how slight if you do make her angry enough she is likely to attack you more with the intent of frightening you into silence than maiming or killing if you do get injured though she wont feel too guilty about it the best way to anger her is by insulting her pride of all her emotions that is the one she feels most strongly overridden occasionally by fear of which she is ashamed her policy of never running from a fight puts her life in danger fairly often there is a constant battle of pride and selfpreservation going on inside her when she is engaged with an enemy a war between fighting and dying honourably or fleeing and living another day so far she has always chosen the right moment to flee although every time she does so she is effectively useless for the next few days because she is mentally berating herself she is very secretive about her past in particular although that may stem from the conviction that any information about her can be used against her in some way she will open up to someone only after shes had several incidences that cause her to trust that person often over several months or even years it takes a lot to make wren trust it isnt a state that comes easily to her she doesnt get along well with most people especially bubbly and open people she thinks theyre a bit foolish for the most part divulging information often without realizing it to people whom they hardly know she occasionally makes friends with other silent people although this can only be called friendship if one stretches the term to breaking point seeing as two silent people will rarely talk to each other it is difficult to call them friends she is generally uninterested in political affairs unless of course they directly affect her she will take notice of politics only if it is absolutely necessary and doesnt think much of noblemen or kings believing them rightly to be dishonestweylan was raised far from other people secluded in the mountains of faedrun his father was the last known warrior of an old now mostly forgotten order of warrior mages known as the order of the emerald shield roughly 60 years ago the emerald shield was disgraced and hunted down no one was sure of what caused this some theories say that the penitent saw them as a threat and chose to eliminate it others say it was another group following the same line of thought yet more believed that the emerald shields leadership had become corrupt the end result was the same the emerald shield was accused of perpetrating foul and dangerous magic against the rest of mankind and its members hunted down one member of the group however survived and lived the rest of his life in hiding where he started a family when the warrior mages son weylan began to mature he recognized his own magical talent in the boy and saw him as a way to carry on the emerald shield and his own proud lineage he trained weylan in the ways of the emerald shield and told him all about their history some years later his parents fell to the undead plague that had by this time conquered much of faedrun weylan buried the only family hed ever had and moved on to have his own adventures as he crossed faedrun he took his revenge on the undeadall the while hiding is loyalty to the long lost emerald shield eventually he wound up in vandregonheld territory and boarded a ship for the new continent on the long journey he struck up conversation with a human girl nighen and began traveling with her once they landed on mardrun from there the two met up with ryla and tylon and began the mardrun trading consortium affiliations the order of the emerald shield many many years ago a bloody feud between two mage orders took place in secret no one can recall why it took place or which side started it but all those involved claim it was for knowledge and power over all the world the orders clashed with such ferocity that it shook the foundations of reality both sides found themselves using immensely dangerous spells and creating powerful artifacts and weapons to use on each other however eventually this hidden war became too much for many of those involved too much was lost and no ground given skilled mages of both sides of this conflict banded together sick of the depths their once proud leaders had sunken to they demanded an end to this pointless feud so they formed an order of their own to bring an end to this bloody battle their order the order of the emerald shield dedicated itself to keeping peace among those gifted in the art of magic and those who were not for years they kept mages with foul intents from gaining power and protected those without power from the maddened whims of magic users when the undead plague broke out in faedrun the emerald shield did all they could to face this new threat head on they focused primarily on trying to find a reason why it was starting so they may put an end to it however due to unknown eventssuch as corruption in their ranks or the forces of the undeads followers the penitentthe order of the emerald shield fell into disgrace and its memory lost to time although that is the accepted history of the emerald shield there is also a legend told in the darkness in whispered voices this is that story many years ago before the golden age of peace that everyone speaks of there was a time when the syndar and humans were at war with each other massive armies from each kingdom faced each other on battlefields where the earth ran red with blood from both sides arrows rained down like water and the sound of sword and shield could be heard for miles from the battlefield magic would enchant many weapons and light up the battlefield in rings of fire lightning would often be seen during war regardless of what the weather was magic was used as a more brutal and uncontrolled weapon then when the force of men could not break the lines mages on both fronts would summon forth beasts without name from the ground creatures whose roar chilled even the bravest warriors heart footsteps that shook the very ground and eyes glowing brighter than any gem or torch ever seen on land air or sea both kingdoms were laid to ruin no army ever truly wondespite what some scholars preach the losses on both sides were too many to count bodies lay as far as the eye could see in every direction such careless waste of life sickened both kingdoms beyond words after one of the bloodiest battles yet both kingdoms lay barren and batteredafter a century of war and no end in sight the kings on both sides were weary of war but tireless in their efforts to make the other surrender yet in this tense silence no army was rallied no calls to war were sound the two kingdoms lay in a quiet stand off for many years with none left to fight their war for them meanwhile in the wild mountains of the north the kings each sent an envoy in secret to meet sickened with war and knowing that the world would not survive with another war of that scale they formed a secret alliance they were still hesitant of each other and wanted to make sure that any vow or pact would be truly honored by both sides but were unsure how to make it so the legend tells that people saw a great green beast flying overhead to the wild mountains in the north and feared it was an omen of more war to come yet no war came the beast arrived at the camp of the alliance surprised to see the enemies united in a common goal for 5 days the beast listened to the agreement and bound the pact insuring the members that it would last for many generations to come when the beast bound the pact he breathed a great white hot fire onto a pyre of wood lighting it instantly the beast then removed one of its emerald scales and placed it on the fire each member of the alliance placed their hand onto the glowing scale and watched in awe as brilliant light wrapped up their arm and throughout their body binding them to the pact looking down each member saw a fresh symbol on the forearm they repeated the oath that the beast spoke in the old tongue the only truly sacred source of power left untouched by both races out of respect or fear of the gods of old the beast told them to pass along the stories of the fate the world nearly suffered to their children should the pact survive they would bring children once every 5 years to the scale and place them before it if the scale glowed the child would be taken by the order to begin their new life several months later the alliance set out to each kingdom with the news of the pact and what must happen for the world to survive after several attempts the kings of each land agreed to an alliance with one another years later word had spread through the land of warriors from the great northern mountain with the power to summon the creatures of old the order of the emerald shield was the name that came to be known throughout the land people told tales of the day the giant dragon of a world long forgotten had returned to aid man and syndar the tales say that farmers remember seeing the sun reflect off the great beast whose skin glistened like the brightest emeralds some claim to remember the multitude of beings that were controlled by either side during the wars the emerald shield remained secluded in their mountain home as each kingdom rebuilt itself and began to once again prosper they feared that if they remained in any kingdom too long that jealousy and suspicion would build and war may begin again many generations passed since that day in the mountain the politics within each kingdom had begun to influence laws that were set down long ago the truce that was struck over a hundred years before was being questioned by both sides talk of betrayal and war began to surface as the first encounters with the undead had been seen each side blamed the other and fear began to trickle down through the townsfolk as it often did the kings sent messages to the mountain for aid even with the emerald shields aid the undead were difficult to drive back and defeat sometime during the battles a lich cast a powerful ritual of an old and dark magic on the emerald shield this curse corrupted the emerald shields magic so their spells didnt work how they should and harmed the caster just as often as the intended target the dead mages rose again as undead and turned on their former allies the emerald shield numbers diminished quickly but not all hope was lost as mage after mage fell to the curse the mighty winged beast appeared once again the lich and the beast battled and as claw rent bone magic twisted together until the hideous twisted power that was the lich disappeared in a beam of incredible light when the light dimmed the beast emerged with several grievous wounds and took flight without a word to the emerald shield the people of the mountain tell of the beast returning to the peak and collapsing with a crash that shook the earth within moments the body of the beast began to glow and vaporize into white embers leaving only the skull with an eye of emerald in its placeplayer

plate armor chainmail and an upturned mustache notable traits can be heard from a notable distance due to armor very flamboyant style accent is extremely strong bio deep in the north of the culclaimete of richtcrag in the northern most lairdship called deighcraig where summer was just a thawing of the ground and the rest of the seasons were snow and ice was where volrok was born now volroks mother is unknown to him but what he does know is that she died protecting him from a swarm of undead when they invaded deighcraig this left his father to care and protect him as a mere babe as they fled the massive wave of undeath at least this is what his oclaochra father torcoll the crimson hinrich told him but that did not matter what mattered was that he had a father that was willing to raise and teach him the ways of the local oclaochra now most oclaochra were fairly similar in culclaimete  drunken battleproud warriors whose capacity for drink was outmatched only by their love of fighting but the small group up in deigcraig were of a slightly different breed they were some of the most honorable and gentlemanly warriors when not in battle not like the rest of the culclaimete oclaochra they viewed that a constant stupor of alcohol could dull the senses and weaken them in battle however there was another tradition that made the oclaochra of deigcraig different it was rite of passage seen by the warriors of deigcraig as the most common  and some say honorable  way to join the ranks of the oclaochra those whom completed this rite are called battleborn in the words of volrok being a battleborn is a grand honor as for what it means it means to be born again through battle a baptism of blood if you would to become a battleborn one simply has to go into and stay in a blood rage for an extended period of time as for volrok his rite happened rather unfortunately on his second paid engagement as an oclaochra he was to guard a lairds daughter from brigands neerdowells and others who might wish to exploit her station and threaten her family while she went to the market while he wasnt looking the young lady was pulled into an alleyway and was about to be taken by several hired blades thankfully the young lady could scream quite loudly loud enough for volrok to hear over the din of the market place disgusted at himself for letting her get pulled into the alley the sight of the thugs dragging his charge whom he sworn to protect being dragged away volrok went into his very first blood rage sadly even though he killed one of the thugs and mortally wounded another he suffered a heavy blow in return severely injuring his right knee to this day it will occasionally lock up due to the cut ligament when the young lady spoke of this to her father the local laird as well as torcoll volrok was given the the honorary title battleborn despite his youth and inexperience a year after this torcoll heard of some promising work over on the new continent of mardrun before volrok got a say in the matter his entire oclaochra company of twenty strong warriors went to cross the sea when they got to mardrun the promised wealth failed to appear  instead they found only chaos clashes between the ulven and the colonists happened constantly and the company was given little to no pay for their services at this time lumped in with the other desperate refugees seeking to flee from the undead and even called scoundrels for adhering to their code of requiring payment for their services over time and after the death of ten of their men the fragile peace between the ulven and the colonists gained traction this put the company practically out of business  at least until the threat of the mordok grew large enough for the colonists to take notice the mordok as his father said were a blessing from the battle father this put the company back in business and they were beginning to make a nice profit their final job as a company was to be the one that finally found them with enough riches to outfit even the highest of lairds  escorting a caravan from starkhaven then it happened a massive mordok raid took the caravan by complete surprise slipping past their posted watch volrok was ordered to escort the surviving merchants to the nearest village or outpost for safety to this day he still remembers his fathers final words as a mordok arrow pierced his heart  come beast if i am to die then let my blade be soaked with mordok blood for honor and glory for the battle father now volrok did not turn around to aid torcoll nor did he go to try and avenge him no he was taught better  the contract always came first he quickly rushed the merchants to davens reach and then returned to the site of the ambush with a small company of guards no bodies where ever found that event was nine cycles ago and volrok has matured into a fine oclaochra he continues on the tradition of the battleborn name and gives his praise to his chosen god the battle father now here in mardrun the battle father is practically unheard of  except for those scant few survivors from culclaimete to explain this rather peculiar religion one must start at the beginning according to legend all the deities wished peace for what they created but the battle father was wise and knew if there was nothing but peace for these creatures they would perish if ever faced with true hardship so he went before the rest of the gods and spoke his wisdom to them the other gods laughed at what they deemed foolish nonsense but soon their people began to perish due to plagues and the violence of wild beasts so they went to the battle father and begged him to save their works with a single swing of his sword he cut the veil of peace that was laid over the world to this day you can still see the scar in the night sky the great scar whose glory shines even brighter over mardrun from here it is said that only a select few were given knowledge of his deeds and spoke little of the battle father but eventually a cleric in deighcraig came forth and gave this knowledge to the local oclaochra after a vision of the battle fathers legendary blow to destroy the weakness that had once threatened all creations of the gods they came to see the battle father as the one that gave them the skill and strength to survive in such a warravaged land currently volrok is one of the very few oclaochra known to be left on mardrun and is still adhering to their ways and traditions after working for a caravan the silver raven trade company he worked on as a guard for the outpost for a few days he enjoyed his work there getting to fight mordok and even gaining honor by saving the tavern from a mordok raid sadly his contract is now expired and will most likely wander from location to location looking for work that is worthy of his skill honor and price during his travels he is alway sure to send out a summons for any remaining oclaochra to rally to him with a war on the horizon the time for honor money and glory will soon be at hand once again for what better way to make a profit than to hire out an entire company of oclaochra for a reasonable price given the circumstances personality out of battle volrok is a man of honor and duty who will go above and beyond was he was contracted to do he can have a crude sense of humor and will occasionally knock back a single mead however if his honor is ever insulted or questioned he will become rather enraged and may attempt a brawl if the insult is serious enough he may just outright kill that person in battle he tends hoot and yell at the enemy taunting them to come into his reach as a trained mercenary he is willing to work with groups and will gladly take point so that he may attempt to claim glory when the chance is viable when fighting an opponent there may be a chance that all logic will be thrown to the wind as he enters a blood rage relationships best of friends battle silver and mead actual friends none at the time ulven interesting folk i find honor in battle with them i especially find joy in battle with them for other reasons like the mutual dislike for mordok yelling and taunting the enemy and a love for a good hard fight syndar have yet to be paid well by one have yet to battle with one sidebyside so i find syndar uninteresting humans humans are difficult i trust ulven more than fellow humans simply due to the lack of honor most humans have rumors this lone oclaochra is looking for others who are of like mind as he other oclaochra or those that may desire to become oclaochra that may wish to band together and introduce mardrun of their skills and services    for a hefty price of course constantly speaks of a god by the name of battlefather will fly into a blood rage while in a fight very possible he could be a bard on the side as he is often found singing when confronted on the subject he replies if wanted to be bard i would not hire out my bladeplayed by andy andersen name

birthplace in the kingdom of vandregon on faedrun appearance wears the vandregon colors under a cloak relationships none rumors from his studies some think he is too close to the undead bio i am not out to claim glory or power i am vladimir saint of the ivanovitch family my mother and father sent me to the arms of the church during the undead plague back home at the age of 7 but i did not despair they were not as loving as they could of been the church offered me knowledge and a safe haven on the new continent of mardun once the boats started to set sail for this new world the priests who had taught me for most of my life took me and the rest of us and boarded the first ship to leave i enjoyed the trip the crew had such stories to tell and some had stories of the undead or being attacked by the penitent i was so interested in them and helping those of the ship that they gave me the nickname saint when we finally arrived on mardun things were very much as i thought it would be a land also in the middle of a war for at this time the humans and syndar were in a bitter war with the native ulven the priests whom i had come to call family quickly moved to establish a new homestead in a small village outside of the newly established settlement called new hope days here seemed to go by fast just as the people who rushed back and forth from the front lines and from the shores and before we knew it the war had ended some say we won others said the ulven prevailed either way the war was over and i thought maybe now i can continue my research and studies i was always one to take things apart and figure out how it worked and the one thing i longed to study was not as available here i wished to study the undead i had learned all i could from the books in the library and i wanted more than anything to study them me being just a boy of fourteen i wanted to do this more than anything and i pandered to the others i even went as far as talking to the head priest calder calder was as religious as he was ruthless he had fought on the front lines of the aldorians and the vandregon he has seen the undead scourge for himself this made him my favorite place to go to answers but unfortunately he did not give out information on his battle experiences easily so when i came to him telling him i wanted to study the undead he was furious he said the undead are not to be studied rather they needed to be destroyed by the light i was a man of the cloth as much as the rest but i was also a man of the sciences so anyone can imagine the conflict that this caused me inside even though calder would not allow me to study the undead i still found ways to keep myself entertained a stack of books arrived all on the battle tactics of the armies of the old and new one book was on the aldorian army several on the vandregon army and one or two that really interested me were on not only the tactics of the ulven and each of the clans individual tendencies and specialties in battle but one was titles mordok hunting it talked so low of the mordok it made perfect sense that more people think of them as animals i took all the tactics and worked to apply it to my combat strategies my training took me years to perfect and by the time i was eighteen i felt ready to set out and join the world i hade planned on joining new vandregon in two months then one day a group came to our church in search for a blessing on a journey they were embarking on balder was the first to greet them as they came up the steps i was not concerned about what they needed i was preoccupied with my training and meditation later that night calder asked to see me he had never asked to see me before but i went anyways calder lived in a secluded part of the homestead with his wife whom i rarely saw and his son who had a grudge with me when one day his father yelled at him for not being as committed to his studies as i was i had no problems finding calder he was standing in the doorway of his study in a corner i noticed a chest i had never seen it before calder turned to face me and saw that i had noticed it i see you noticed the new chest those people who were earlier left it in our care why we have no need for it and who is the lock supposed to keep out calder looks to me with a blank stare those people left it in our careit is imperative it stays locked away from those who are not worthy so what did you want to see me about i called you here because i know you are planning on joining the vandregon army i know you were planning on leaving us here without any explanation i almost jumped when he said that but i let him continue however thought i would not be mad at you for thisi too served for the vandregon they are an honorable group and they would be lucky to have you but first you need to prove that you can fight this brings me to why i called you in here those people need a cleric to go with them and a blessing for their trip i told them i would send my best and brightest cleric and thats you now youre not to let them stray away from this path he handed me a map of mardrun here is onsallas outpost i have heard from a reliable contact that two vandregon warriors from the militia known as the myrmiden will be there one day earlier than the vandregons current leader william maybe there you will be able to join them now get moving you leave tonight and should arrive to the outpost in three days time i couldnt have been more excited about the pleasant turn of events later that night i met up with the group i will be traveling with there were a total of fifteen of us this chest must be very important if they managed to gather so many people the journey took all of two days to go to hell on the night of the second day we were all woken up in the late night by a man on watch called brueter brueter had with him a traveling companion named rachel i had no doubt that the two were engaged in relations with each other he was screaming hes found us rachel we must get the chest and make hast to the outpost they can protect us there i had no idea who he was so i pondered who could have these men and woman who had seen death and killed in such disarray then i felt as if something was there and odd feeling crept into my body as i noticed that another woman was with us her shadow was taller and leaner like a man and held a spear my brain moved too fast for my body to react her chest erupted with crimson red blood covering the spear tip as it slid back through her body and a man appeared behind her but he was not really a man his face had almost no color or flesh on it his eye sockets were void of any eyes just black holes this was an undead i became excited here it was standing just as i had thought it would void of any emotion but i had to wait till it was dead for me to study it i thought to myself my mind was suddenly taken by fear as it lunged towards me spear in hand ready to thrust its sharp head into mine i side stepped the thrust but not before realizing that someone was standing behind me and was not in the cross fire and before either of us came to our sensed it was too late and the spear entered his throat and exited out the back of his neck when it retracted it pulled out strands of veins and muscle soon the others were aware of what was going on a panic quickly set in each man and woman was working to get away at any cost but this foolish effort ended up killing more and more of them some were set on fire stumbling into the still burning fires other ran into each others drawn weapons this mass hysteria was soon calmed and controlled by an ex vandregon soldier i had learned of him when i met him he was an older man in his late thirties called axas he was dishonorably discharged due to a crippling injury he sustained during a drunken brawl he started none the less he started barking orders and soon rallied us into a line only ten of us were left after the beginning panic one man moved to lunge his great sword in the undeads stomach but the undead was unfazed by this and moved forward onto the blade until he was face to face with the man who stood petrified soon the undead made its move and it thrusted its hand around the mans face and began to squeeze slowly and painfully the mans head started to crack and bleed his eye were being gouged out and squeezed the blood curdling screams could be a nightmare in and of itself but it wasnt long before the undead had squeezed the life out of his victim and let his limp body fall into the dirt but axas stood tall weapon drawn before he called for them to rush the undead the undead had thrusted his sword into another person but this time he let it go reached for the handle of the great sword in his stomach and pulled it out the battle began axas did his best but no one in our little group had the minerals to stand up to this seemingly invincible enemy i was trying to convince axas to hand me his sword so that i could bless it but before i could get a chance the undead made a strong powerful swing for axas and knocked him back the undead were swinging slowly but it would connect on almost every swing and these swings were powerful at one point he swung hard for axas and it connected with his big tower shield and it cracked and splintered right up the middle one by one they started to fall like flies axas finally gave up his sword so that i could bless it i ran for cover in the tall grass that surrounded us but as i started the ritual i noticed that the undead had not been so interested in me until now i heard its heavy footsteps behind me as i turned around to catch him but instead i found a knife in my side i blacked almost out instantly from the pain when i regained consciousness i looked around to see if there were any survivors i only found the reanimated corpses of the others i had to get away or else i would be next i looked over and i could see the undead has its hand on bruters head and all of a sudden his dead body began seizing and jerking for two minutes till the undead staggered away almost in pain i thought to myself this is how an undead is madei had learned about the dark energy that coursed through an undead but i never had seen it in play this undead was able to make its dark energy into a dead body i saw the undead move to me as he got closer and closer i knew i would have to endure more pain than i ever sustained if i was to survive as the undead reached me i reached up and grabbed the undeads arm and bought it close to me i took the dagger out of my side and trusted it into his chest i then kicked him away i ran as fast as i could into the dirge swamp i knew i could not go back so i decided i would hide out in this swamp till i could regain my facilities i foraged off the land and meditated and thought long and hard on the battle then one day after so long by myself i met someonecharacter bio name vincent fallencry played by nik knight age 35 race human skills bio vincent fallencry is the youngest of the fallencry brothers vincent is also the most introverted among his brothers vincent strongly distrusts everyone he comes into contact with and sometimes feels this same attitude toward his own brothers basically shutting himself out from the world and relying heavily on his own strength and way of thinking vincent often got into conflicts with his brothers over his attitude this attitude developed when vincent and his brothers were moving to the coast vincent and his mother had fallen behind and the coastal town was being raided by undead and the penitent vincents cousin henry ran back to help them feeling the pressure of the undead henry grabbed vincent and cut his mothers ankles saying she is nothing but dead weight now as henry left her behind vincent struggled against henry as hard as he could lashing henry in the eye until dimitri came over to help them dimitri saw their mother being devoured by the undead and worked quickly to drag vincent to the boat later once they had fled the shores dimitri went to check on vincent when he walked in he saw vincent over the top of henry with a bloody knife in his hand and blood all over the cabin when dimitri asked what had happened vincent simply said he was nothing but dead weight now in a cold emotionless voice viewing his actions as if they were justified vincent didnt expect the ships crew or his family to lock him up in a makeshift cell for the murder of his cousin henry this harsh treatment not only surprised him but furthered his distrust of people he had by this point become completely disillusioned in his brother for their unwillingness to believe him as each day passes vincent spends the voyage to mardrun in his cell slowly believing that there is no one he can rely on and begins to push his brother away each time they visit upon arrival to the new land mardrun vincent was freed from his makeshift cell by his brother dimitri as soon as vincent set foot on the solid ground he ran for the woods fearing he would be locked up again making no attempt to cover his trail vincent then collapses due to exhaustiononce he awakens he realizes he is not alone as he sits up he sees his brother dimitri after a long discussion vincent goes back with dimitri to his family and feels forced to follow his brotherbut as each day passes vincent wonders who will betray him next and how will he escape before this happensname vazra played by drake nelson gender male age race formless identity human how did this begin i think back to the last moments of my life my opponent is mighty i cannot win as it strangles the life out of me i resort to my trump card scatter with me into everything and then i am lost vanished into the mana stream where i have languished ever since realizing i was trapped i quickly erected a series of barriers to shield my essence against those that would unknowingly drain me for their spells as the years drag by i have abandoned all hope of rescue i have simply resigned myself to endure the never ending onslaught of time a prisoner devoid of form identity and even a physical presence this never ending everything i am omnipresent scattered across the vastness of the mana steam every instant i endure the collective perception of innumerable lives yet retain no more than few fleeting moments it is a mercy my fragile mortal mind would burst in an instant if exposed to even a moment of omniscience i have placed wards to resist even those fleeting moments i might otherwise retain sometimes even then under the overwhelming strain an experience evades my barriers and sticks with me each haunts me for every memory a salmon struggling upstream the pained screams of a wounded soldier the grief of a mother whose child was born still steals away the place of one of my own and pushes me further into madness it has been so long my life in this place has long since exceeded the life that came before i have outlived the expectancy of a human and it is terrifying for now it has become clear that even the freedom of death lies beyond the reaches of time i feel so very old i feel so very trapped the years pass like this perhaps there was life before all of this came to pass but it has been so long i can scarcely remember nothing but fragments remain of who i was and i cant shake the feeling even those pieces are wrong too i have even forgotten the choices i made to find myself here that feeling eats away at what little is still left of me what a cruel fate to suffer with no memory of the cause what did i trade this for perhaps if i could only know why i might be able to make peace with this i now long for death any escape from this eternal madness the barriers i first established to protect myself now shackle me to this existence and i am powerless to undo them i can only wish they shatter so that i might interact with the physical world one last time as i am drawn into a spell and consumed i surrender my mental wards i surrender to madness i am no longer anybody i simply experience i have accepted my fate i will simply be content to observe without purpose i see now that i have always been free from this moment on i will revel in this fate there is so much to feel and yet never know and then one day it came to an end in a blast i emerge immediately assaulted by an onslaught of physical sensation that i had grown unaccustomed to every touch is overwhelming every sight is blinding every sound deafening the world screams and swirls around me the simple forest appears as a maelstrom to me strangers approach i do not trust them but they are kind and calm and i am a stranger to this reality as i regain my bearings a terrible reality sinks in i have reemerged into a new world lifetimes after my disappearance on faedrun i can remember nothing but the screams of those left behind loved ones i was helpless to save but whose names i cannot even remember the guilt tears me apart and i sink into existential terror i watch them die over and over time passes my sight is plagued by hallucinations both profound and insane between conflicting layers of reality great truths of the world dance alongside warped alien and bizarre thoughts amongst them lurks the dark remnants of a storm that has clawed its way into my heart fragment memories of innumerable lives haunt me and i am powerless to discern which are my own despite this agony i have found new purpose in this world they call mardrun perhaps i will never regain the clarity of a mortal man but i have become something far greater in time i will use my power to make everything right again after all i am vazra the greatest mage to ever livecharacter name valerian played by max

rangers as a mercenary age he doesnt like to talk about it because its older than guthrum bio i was born back on old faedrun my family came from richtcrag  one of the few families that were moved south due to the undead and to live in a single place and possess farmable lands my parents whose names i could never remember were killed when i was very young in a dispute of ownership the farm was lost and i ended up an orphan left to wander the steppes between small settlements i eventually made my way to the more permanent settlements in the south of faedrun where i made my living as a cutpurse as i grew older i started to perform more serious tasks for various groups suffice it to say i made sure their message was heard loud and clear to whoever they figured needed it once i had established myself with sufficient experience and coin i traveled back to my family home i delivered the current occupants a message that was long overdue they caught on fast enough though and the remaining few fled for a time i returned to my roots content to farm the land as my father had whenever i grew tired of the mundane affair of farming i would venture back south for some more exciting work this cycle continued for a time until the dead came i imagine many stories are now told this way i survived the ordeal like most alone and penniless in a new world with new rules there was plenty of work for those who had my skill set in this place the peace with the locals had broken down and there were always plenty of messages that needed to be delivered as many different factions vied for control and influence over their new home the day came i was approached by one of the strange local inhabitants of this new world claiming lineage from some clan grim something or another it mattered not to me he had a message to send and the coin to see its deliverance that message proved to be one of the more arduous affairs of my life i had to track down a lion as they called them who were roaming about the countryside and make it look like they was casualties of war as it was you see it was easier then than it would have been now relations with the locals bad as they were nasty armored zealots prattling on about their god of such and another even as they drew their last breaths this started a downward spiral in my luck on my journey back i constantly came across various other unfriendly individuals my wounds began to grow deep their toll was heavy i found myself wandering in a daze of sweat and fever dreams until one day i awoke in a small camp a man by the name of isa had found me unconscious in the forest and treated me i questioned why a stranger would go to such lengths to which he responded got enough dead back home it was through this man i found my way to the brotherhood of the long winter it was led by a man they called jarl ivar he led us north and established a small camp that was to grow into a settlement those days did not last the brotherhood was beset with hard times and harsh weather and soon began to erode into something twisted i left when it became obvious that to stay was to fall with itplayed by mike hale character name uthyur gender

backstory what are you searching for have you ever really thought about it you have spent your whole life chasing experience why you can use the experience you gain to better yourself if you try but is that your goal are you merely trying to amass skill wealth and power like some sort of parasite competing with the rest of your kind to see who can be the fattest while your host languishes under the combined weight of you and your ilk i know my answer peace not the peace of nations or two people settling a feud i care nothing for the pains of others inner peace is my aim the peace of balance of stillness that lets your living mind feel the silence of the grave i am no tick to take the life blood of those around me for my own uses i must make my own spiritual sustenance for i will be eternal i remember when our king rose again i recall the terror when he ordered the gates opened and the confusion when we were not killed the penitent walked through the city as if they were on parade they looked so proud i still sometimes wonder if they thought they had conquered us the undead merely walked corpses even walking ones have no need for pride although it could just be that they knew the truth i was still a girl when the gates were opened but i had lived my whole life trying to conquer my fear of the undead and their followers when i was suddenly confronted with the reality of living side by side with my nightmares and the worst did not come to pass i was forced to look at the enemy in a new light the undead were not what i expected they were gruesome sure but they just didnt do very much most of the time they were just still i was surprised to learn that despite their formidable power and martial prowess they are actually quite fragile most of the times that i did see them moving they were engaged in activities to preserve their bodies the undead with flesh did things like stitching together cuts and oiling their skin like i would care for leather armor those without would pad their joints with leather to prevent the bones from wearing they seemed particularly concerned with preventing rot i imagine they found the dry desert air of saresh comforting it turned out that the real monsters were the penitent i am not sure if they felt entitled were stupid or had just never spent time in civilization within the maykar dominion everything has a price and nothing is free i remember on that first day when the gates were open seeing a group penitent arguing with an innkeeper about having to pay for a room one of them became so enraged at the idea of having to pay they struck the innkeeper a passing lesser undead shambled over and the group of penitent started to grin i suspect that they thought they were about to see a show it turned out that they were right the lesser undead grabbed the hand that had hit the innkeeper pulled it and the arm from the penitent and beat him with his own arm till he stopped moving then it just walked away as if it had been window shopping and decided the price was too high on the item it was looking at i had thought that the lesson was clear that violence against the maykar would not be tolerated i was wrong the next morning the innkeeper was found on the spot the penitent had fallen her body parts had been cleverly rearranged to form the distinctive teardrops that the penitent had tattooed on their cheeks the real lesson was that violence against the maykar would not be seen i knew many people who tried to leave saresh for the villages or even the other nations but every time someone would try to leave there would be tears on the road when the gates were opened in the morning while we were no longer under siege from without the siege from within was much worse it wasnt long before the vandregonians came and it was not just us that were trapped within the walls of saresh the penitent numbers quickly dwindled since they seemed to prefer fighting the vandregonians head on to letting the desert do the fighting for them perhaps they were bored perhaps they had something to prove perhaps they just didnt understand the patience required to weather a siege i was almost happy the vandregonians laid siege to saresh for 17 years before they finally broke us as a people i dont know how they broke our walls my husband and i had found a way out of the city before it fell but that isnt the part that matters anyways what matters is what the barbarians did once we were defeated they lined my people up and asked them if they would fight to stop the penitent and their undead gods as if they didnt know that we follow mashi i wonder if they phrased the question that way on purpose i could almost overlook the genocide if it werent for saresh itself you would think that it would be enough to destroy our people and scatter us but no they burned saresh and toppled anything that was left they destroyed our libraries poisoned the wells and desecrated the statues of the gods the vandregonians made sure that we could never rebuild the glory of the city that was heaven on earth after saresh fell everything was different i was 25 and on the run with my husband through the great forests trying to find a safe place it was the first time i had been outside the walls of saresh and the outside world may as well have been another planet for all i knew of it it was years and a lifetime before we found ourselves on a ship bound for mardrun by that time we had found other maykar and it almost felt like we had a real family again all of us were infatuated with the idea of saving our culture from annihilation we decided to settle in secret far away from the other human colonies and to try and rebuild the best we could from memorycharacter trevor lafont player andrew berner class mage trevor lafonts family were some of the first humans to see mardrun when the nation of aldoria began sending colonists to the new continent the lafont family went in search for a new life away from the undead plague word of the new continent had reached them and the promise of escaping the coming darkness was all they needed so years before the mass exodus from faedrun the lafonts braved the ocean to land on mardrun beekeeping and meadbrewing were the endeavors that had won his family its wealth as well as more than a few academics and they had never had a taste for conflict the family packed up what they could of the apiaries and gathered any willing household members and retainers the journey was mercifully smooth but when they landed they were met by bestial warriors who called themselves ulven when lord lafont made his intentions of settlement clear he was struck dead on the spot fortunately the lafont family had always had a matriarchal structure anyway lady lafont then boldly stepped forward and offered a gift of mead to the ulven who took it and departed without further bloodshed the lafonts took this as a sign that they had befriended the ulven though in reality this was not the case and proceeded to build their new home the ulven returned a few weeks later but chose to leave the family at peace due to the martial force that had arrived from faedrunwith the help of the aldorian soldiers and a few of the neighboring families the lafonts were able to erect a small fortified estate over the years where their bee pastures could produce honey for the various wonderful products that were enjoyed so much though they had taken a risk abandoned their nobility and left so much behind the lafonts had survived and created a peaceful if harder life for themselves time passed the estate thrived and trade with the ulven became common after the peace treaty was signed trevor grew up slightly sheltered from the harshness of the new world due to relatively comfortable life on the estate the chores were hard but there was always food and the ulven along with the few lafont guard kept most of the dangers away he excelled in many academic pursuits enjoying the library that had so carefully been transported from faedrun true to his lafont blood he showed an aptitude for magic and medicine as well as a touch of madness unlike a typical lafont trevor did not shy from combat as a boy he spent much time training with his half brother heinrich at the age of 12 trevor fell into a deep coma when he was kicked in the head by a cow that he was trying to milk his mother and sister cared for him during this time but it was all they could do to keep him alive he experienced several vivid fever dreams in that time fantastic adventures against monsters and to places he had only ever read about if not made up entirely after nearly two full weeks he awoke and has since recovered if not fully after that time passed trevor grew up the exodus from faedrun happened and many of the things young trevor read about became real his half brother the person he was closest with left to become a mercenary conflict broke out the mordok had been the only real threat but now thing had become more complicated the feuds and politics of the faedrun spilled into the new continent everything was changing but maybe it wasnt all bad he decided to join the larger world he knew his younger sister and mother could run the estate fine without him there were people to meet places to explore and mysteries to solve he would be there when they honey caravans were running and the mead needed bottling but for now there were too many other things to do it was time to leave the safety of his familys estate it was time for his real adventure to

young i do remember they got to us one day my mother handed me my baby sister bonnie and told me to run i tried to argue with her but eventually i ran after days of running and hiding i made it to a boat crying hungry and tired from carrying my little sister i snuck aboard which isnt hard to do when no one is paying attention to an orphan i sat in a darkened stairwell for what seemed like forever eventually the boat started moving the last of the food and water from the pack my father had given me ran out the second day on the boat i carefully placed my sister behind some barrels on the makeshift bed i crafted for our journey shushing her to sleep when she closed her eyes began her peaceful breathing i took my leave i had to find us some food before she began crying out of hunger i wandered around the boats making sure i never once gave anyone a reason to give me a second look i turned the corner to duck into the kitchen and smacked into a rock of a man i landed on my back and when my eyes opened there were dark grey ones staring back at me the man jurrok looked at me with curiosity i looked away at first i couldnt handle the sad look he was giving me youre the one thats been taking the bread you know how i know i shook my head you dont use a knife you break little pieces off because youre not big enough to reach the sharp knife he stated i could if i wanted to but itd make too much noise and then id be caught i spat back i wasnt about to let someone call me little after all ive been through i lost my mother my father grams and gramps and even my best friend i didnt know if i was going to make it or worse if my sister was i started to shake i was trying not to cry men dont cry and i had to be a man to take care of bonnie youve been through a lot i can see the death in your eyes must of lost many loved ones everyone has i myself lost my wife and my son they were killed right in front of me you remind me a lot of my son he said with a sad tone to his voice he turned his face towards me and smiled which is why im going to help you no one knows my story but everyone knows theres a kid on board that isnt with a family thats you im going to bring you to the captain and claim you as my son that i thought i had lost you but youve been on board this whole time you wont have to steal food and youll get an equal share like everyone else that okay with you i sat there staring at him for what seemed like hours why was he being nice i couldnt understand exactly why but it didnt matter i felt like i could trust him my little sister too i asked his eyes lit up and a smile spread across his face ive always wanted a daughter when we made it to a new land bonnie and i stayed with jurrok i took care of bonnie and helped jurrok with chores and he taught me how to fish cook and hunt i learned a lot that first year we all did when i turned 15 jurrok decided to teach me how to fight every day for three hours we practiced with shields and wooden swords we continued this way for years once i was good enough he took me out hunting one day when we were out hunting i spotted a deer i wasnt close enough to get a good shot off so i tracked it until i could i must have tracked this deer for hours through thick brush and woods the deer stopped at a small creek to drink and i got ready to take my shot when some twigs broke off in the distance and scared the deer away disappointed and empty handed i stood up to make my way back but as i looked around i realized i was lost i thought for a long time and just stared out in every direction trying to remember which way i came from eventually i made my decision and headed out after a few hours i realized that this was probably not the way back i was so lost and tired i decided to make camp i made a small fire and ate some rations i had in my pack when i was going to sleep i put the fire out and made my way up a tree jurrok was always one to err on the side of caution so he taught all the hunters how to safely sleep in the trees we are in uncharted territory and need to be careful i continued to do this for a week give or take a few days until i was caught and tied up by a couple of ulven who called themselves whiteoak when it got darker i pulled the knife i had hidden in my boot out and started cutting at the rope i know i missed a few times and cut my arms but the blood made it easier to slide my hands out when the bigger of the two guys went to sleep i made my move i pretended like i had to pee and the one that was awake angrily took me out keeping his hand on my shoulder so i couldnt run about 20 or 30 ft away from the little campsite i tripped he didnt even have time to realize what had happened as he fell on top of me landing with my knife in his gut i moved quickly to ensure he died quietly i took what little supplies he had on him i went back to the campsite only for my equipment and left quietly one death was more than enough to make my escape no sense in killing the other guy a day or two later i came across a raiding party with humans who were wearing green i did not know if i could trust them so i kept my distance the ones in green intrigued me so i decided to follow the small one who i heard them call puckerman a time or two i thought that was an odd name for someone but dismissed it after night fell and people left the area i still chose to follow this puckerman i decided i would talk with him because he seemed the most trustworthy being able to cast divine magic he had to be good right night fell and i lost track of him for some time but as i made my way towards the crossroads everyone else had gone towards i saw him with two ulven men and a guy with one eye all being attacked by bandits deciding i could help i quietly killed one of the bandits who had gotten close they finally caught up with the rest of their group i continued to watch the ones in green i followed them all the way to their settlement which they called crows landing after a few days of watching the settlement i decided i could pass as a traveler i walked into crows landing trying to seem nonthreatening but how unthreatening can one look when you happen to look like me considering i have spent weeks out in the woods without a bath or a change of clothes its probably why that woman screamed when she saw me that scream hurt my ears and when it stopped and i looked back up there was that guy puckerman staring back at me next to him was an ulven with a scar across his eye and two armed guards hello i said i didnt mean to scare anyone im just looking for a place to clean up and rest ive been lost for some time i swear they were going to throw me in jail i grabbed the hilt of my sword ready to fight when puckerman spoke about damn time you show your face ive been wondering who was following me around figured you werent bad because otherwise you wouldve attacked when our defenses were down so i let you be but hell i thought youd show up sooner almost started thinking id gone crazy you still might be said the scarred ulven if i was wrong tobias then id be dead this guy looks like he could eat me come on now puckerman we both know you can handle your own smirks tobias puckerman just shrugged but i knew it to be true if he wanted to kill me he most certainly could so what shall we do with you says puckerman weakly i respond well i could use a hot bath and meal first but after that im sure we can figure something out indeed we could come on the inn is this way puckerman shouts as he starts walking awaythe order of arnaths fist thats all ive known sure i tried living life outside of it for a while once we were on mardrun but that didnt work like i thought it would like all humans i was born on faedrun i lived within the orders borders my father was a lion he fought on our borders defending from enemies that wanted to see us fall my mother could weave the divine magics but studied herbs and healing she never wanted to trust alone in the healing power of the divine i tried to study with her but it never stuck real well i could only get so far with it i never felt as passionate about healing like she did but i always helped her like an obedient daughter should i felt at peace outside the walls hunting for food or acting as an escort for my mother and her expeditions to find new herbs i was never an extremely strong fighter but i could hold my own and my father knew i would defend my mother until i couldnt swing a weapon and even then would use whatever strength in my hands to be sure she could get away i was always proud that he trusted me with her but wondered if by letting me be the one to fall instead of her did he value her life more than mine i could understand why if so but never bothered asking that wasnt what was important protecting her always being strong when needed and not asking questions was what showed true strength by the time i reached my teen years the undead became an overwhelming force and it was apparent we needed to leave faedrun my mother would not leave until my father came with so that we all would be together no matter if that was on this earth or the next after we got to mardrun my dad helped to build the stronghold in starkhaven thats when i began to question whether i should stay or venture on my own my parents never pushed the order onto me for a life to live but they didnt deny any of it from me either with a short discussion of not having regrets i left the order to search for a life outside of it that life was much different than i expected i was proud to have been from the order but there were many out there that did not feel the same fondness or gratitude towards it ulven whose families were relocated even some killed they say the order only treats those that look just like them well i would always defend the order spreading the word to anyone that would listen that the order were the defenders of the weak this got me in many fights a couple times left beaten to a pulp from groups of ulven that didnt feel the same less than a year went by before i came back to the order i had realized that the order was in my blood and nothing would make me more proud than if they accepted me into their ranks times had been hard for the order no support from other human groups the loss of so many order members falling in battle now rejoined with my family we all worked with the rest that stayed to keep the order in as good as shape as we could i trained when i had time studied when i was too exhausted from fighting i petitioned to join the order i was first accepted into the layorder as a scout i knew my fighting was not up to lion standard but i wasnt a complete dunce in it and i could read the land and people pretty well

most ventures though when the value increases so does the hazard now that i had a firm grasp on the art of listening i needed to learn how to blend with my surroundings hunters always knew the best way to sneak up on animals maybe those same concepts would work with people i spent the next couple years shadowing hunters learning the trades of the wild this came to benefit in multiple ways i now had the skills to walk among the crowds and survive off the land when no one was buying the information i had the final piece is to create a web of contacts to spin my tales to this brings my story to

order fear leaving the old world coming to the new world to mardrun it was all i had fear of the dead fear of the water fear of the fangs fear of the monsters mordok theyre called mordok the fear kept me alive survival instincts are just another fancy term for fear bravery is just a fancy term for ignoring your fear i dont remember my parents i know they were part of the order i also know they died before we got to mardrun i dont know how i never asked i do know that i came to a new place alone and horribly afraid surrounded by adults i didnt know i know that the people i met here saved my life i know that the place they took me was the only place i felt like i could breath i know the things they taught me about arnath and his teachings the big people who wore their heavy armor suits i called them the smart ones they marched in their bravery costumes with their short hammers and courage shields i could never imagine being that close to something attacking me i keep a sword just in case but id much rather keep my distance about 9 feet to be specific but arnath demands that i stand true to not recoil before my enemy that doesnt stop the fear though it just means im better at ignoring it than i was as a child i used to hide behind those taller than me it wasnt difficult then as a child it probably isnt difficult now since even full grown im still as tall as a child i would sit close to the fire while i meditated so that i wouldnt think about how cold i was in time i learned that letting your eyes adjust to the darkness is the best way to stay safe so the things in the dark cant creep up on you i also learned that venturing outside of starkhaven was dangerous on its own but most of the time incredibly necessary i still dont like going out but bravery doesnt mean having no fear it just means looking past it i can be shaking in my boots and still protect myself ive never been the loud type or chatty or talkative at all really its always been speak when spoken to stay out of the way dont fall behind mardrun is a chaotic place full of people with far more important jobs than just me as useful as i can sometimes be besides being distracted making small talk never helped anyone quiet people are often ignored which makes it a lot easier to listen in to observe to be his eyes its important to stay aware and get the job done and to stay aware to stay

tribal village in the woods near the aldorian border appearance piercings facial hair notable traits lose cannon piercings shortbroad ferocious womanizer and lover of mead bio i was born in a village nestled deep into the forest i was named shank son of baldor the high shaman or as you would call it cleric of the shadow claw tribe my oldest memories are of a great journey across the sea however faint imagery of beautiful forests and hordes of undead haunt me are these my memories or merely visions of the past i was too young to know how my people could pay their way to the new world my people set up a small farming village near the settlement of new aldoria my training began as soon as i was strong enough to swing a stick much like the others of my age in the tribe my childhood was spent training with axe sword and spear when not fighting we were silently stalking the forest for any creature worth killing and devouring however as son of the high shaman i could not play as the other youths any spare time was spent meditating in a selfinduced trance learning the secrets of the forest and of the physical and spiritual planes after eighteen winters the youths of our tribe are sent out as a party they must spend several moons alone in the wilderness forging their own existence in the wild before proving themselves and returning to the village as men with the blood of the shaman i was afforded no such luxury for i must endure the most harrowing of passages leaving the village alone with nothing but my axe and the skins on my back i was to venture into the forest and not return until a union with ones spirit guide this occurs when you are confronted by a beast and you must engage in mortal combat and once the beast has died and passed to the spirit world you may then return to the village with the beasts spirit guiding you initially i had envy for my brothers for they returned only after a few moons confronted by the fox and the stag i however had to stalk the woods all winter awaiting my encounter meditation and preparing myself for this great duel it was a cold and dreary day almost a year after i left home when i met my fate it was an unusually hard winter and food had been scarce i was stalking a large deer when through either sheer luck or my hunting experience from my year living off the land i landed an arrow through both of its lungs as i began to dress my quarry i realized that i was not alone in this hunt through the blinding snow the dusk reflected several sets of eyes from the nearby tree line as the icy winds chilled my bones and the dense white snow pelted my body one figure stepped from the shadows it was then i realized what exactly what i was facing my time had come as the leader of what i now realized to be a pack of wolves approached me he stepped slowly deliberately towards me even in the falling darkness his black coat still shone his shoulders as broad as my own and his fangs as sharp as my axe yet as he approached he did not growl his ears were erect and he showed no malice he ceased his approach within 15 feet of me and as his final foot fell we became locked in a stare almost as if holding a conversation with our spirits he then laid his head back as he let out a bloodcurdling howl and it was with that our duel began i awoke some time later the night must had passed as it was now well into the morning my body tattered and beaten i strain to roll my head to the side did he retreat had i died in glorious battle and pass over to awaken in the other realm as i finally mustered the strength my eyes fell upon the frozen corpse of my adversary his body as mangled as my own but for the exception of the shattered remnants of my axe head lodged in his skull i passed in and out of consciousness to awaken the next dawn i had regained enough strength to hobble over to the nearest oak which was my favorite tree to meditate beneath as i fell into the trance i once again met the wolf but not my adversary as before now he was my ally my guide we conversed for many hours as i harvested his knowledge however it was coming time to return to the village i longed for the celebration of my return to feast once again in the great hall in the company of my family and tribe but most of all i longed for the warm embrace of suiteki of whom i was to marry after completion of my journey she had regularly snuck out to embrace me on the beds of the sacred river however days had passed after my combat with the great beast and to gaze into her green eyes was my only true wish the spirit agreed to guide me back to what i had known as home but i was warned not to expect any welcoming or familiar faces proudly i navigated through the forest crossing streams and climbing bluffs i finally came within sight of my home however there was not the sound of drums or smoke of fires as i had anticipated the nearer that drew the stronger the stench of death haunted my nostrils as my tribesmen my brethren lay slain and mangled across the land i could not tell if any were still alive if they were they no longer were in the village i had seen this kind of carnage once before in my life and the elders had been highly disturbed by that incident a high council was held and it was found that mordok had been the assailant frantically i searched for the one who would have been my salvation had she lived i would not have been driven into the selfdestructive actions i was about to pursue i found the remains of my beloved suiteki mangled beneath the remains of what had been our hut her hands still clutching the necklace i had given her before i left that was imbued with protective energies from what i could tell she had at least died quickly the spirits had done their job as she had not suffered nearly the fate of my tribesmen that had fell at that moment i was filled with a blood craving rage the wolf and i were now one i let out the same howl the wolf had given before our battle it was the howl of war grabbing every weapon i could reasonably carry i began on a new mission to stalk and slay mordok in the same fashion they had slain my tribesmen and my sweet suiteki until none of the retched beasts remained it had not been more than a day since this slaughter had occurred i hunted swiftly and it would not be long before i cornered my quarry to whatever violent end may come to my surprise i had caught up to my quarry unusually close to where the elders had spoken of a settlement the mordok had intentions of slaughtering whatever group of people that lived there i had only saw one of them likely scouting ahead for a much larger raiding party i knew they were not to be trifled with but i had nothing to hold me to this world i was ready to pass on to the spirit world and rejoin my kin and my love from the concealment of the brush i threw my axe crippling the knee of the mordok and with that the requiem had begun and i raised my sword charging in a glorious blood rage the battle was blow for blow i growled and screamed the chants of war as our blood stained the white snow around us and the echoes of this great fight rattled through the forest crippled and bleeding out i finally landed a great blow severing his arm as i narrowly dodged a swing that would have surely beheaded me yet he charged attempting to bludgeon me to death with the one remaining fist as i deflected with my offhand my bone shattered and he sunk his teeth into my flesh my sword dropped from the impact i was left to slowly bash his skull in with my fist all whilst his teeth were ravaging my other arm i awoke in an unfamiliar bed next to a warm fire with two green hooded and armor clad men standing over me they must have found me dying and rescued me denying me my wish to pass over nonetheless this was an honorable act little did i know that they would become my new tribe however my suiteki would never be replaced relationships puckerman tobias

known skills he received standard training with weapons and armor under the order though they have mostly fallen into disuse low level divine magic ability along with knowledge of how it is used at higher levels was picked up during his order days his lion training taught him the basics of battlefield tactics to prepare him for battle against the undead appearance a tall man over six feet with a muscular but not bulky build sarmion carries himself like a warrior brown hair is cut short then allowed to grow until it becomes bothersome before being cut short again resulting in hair length varying throughout the months his blue eyes are restless constantly flitting about missing little while his bearing may be that of a warrior his garb is not he is usually clad in simple boots pants and a tunic with a simple hooded cloak over all of it a walking stick is typically carried rather than a sword and he rarely finds himself armored relationships as sarmion has been wandering about the human settlements since his arrival on mardrun he has formed no strong connections with anyone though he hasnt made any enemies either the few that bother to remember his name probably only know him as the wandering cleric that was kicked out of the order of arnath rumors while most dont bother themselves with talk of the wandering cleric they occasionally speculate on the truth of why exactly he was expelled from the order of arnath despite him making no secret of the story biobackground history sarmion was born in the year 239 in a small village in the foothills of the celestial mountains not far from the high fortress of the order of arnath at a young age he showed what his parents believed to be an aptitude for divine magic and so they promptly gave him to the order sarmion was trained no different from any other taught to be a warrior and to defend the weak in time he proved his parents right for after several years with the order and much study he did indeed develop a small knack for the divine he was quickly made a lion which should have led him to greatness or at least the possibility to rise above his humble beginnings but instead turned out to lead to his great shame in the year 259 he and the rest of his squad were on the march to reinforce the order against the hordes of undead when they came upon what their commander assumed was a group of bandits he quickly gave the order for the supposed bandits to be dispatched and sarmion did the unthinkable he refused the order on the grounds that the men had not committed any crime that they knew of when sarmion turned and walked away from the commander his commander flew into a rage and ordered sarmion shackled and brought back to the high fortress to be tried as a deserter the ensuing trial was over quickly sarmions entire squad saw him walking away from the commander and that was enough for the judges to condemn him stripped of arms and armor and branded sarmion was cast out from the order sarmions faith in arnath was severely shaken he found the idea that his religious leaders would condemn his refusal to attack men they stumbled across deeply troubling rather than stay in a land that he believed would rather have him serve as an unthinking soldier than a shield for the weak sarmion sought passage to the continent of mardrun where he has been ever since a cleric in search of a

me do it thats what he tells everyone it makes him look good sympathetic the poor jilted man abandoned by a spoiled little girl because his facial features were imperfect and why shouldnt everyone believe it he is ugly i am spoiled i dont deny it i have wanted for nothing my whole life my skin has touched only the smoothest silk robes my lips have tasted only the finest aged oolong teas and the most impeccablycooked gourmet meals i have never slept on the hard ground or beneath the open sky i have never felt cold or hunger i am a spoiled little girl and i know nothing of the world but that doesnt make him the victim hes a liar i didnt abandon my betrothed because he had a big nose i would have grown to accept his nose eventually the rest of him is not so badlyformed hes tall and strong and carries himself well he was not impossibly ugly even if he were i would have done my duty as i was trained to do as honor demanded no if he were merely ugly i would be living in his palace now drinking my fine teas wrapped in silk robes resting in the shade of the pagoda watching the koi flit beneath the surface of his garden pond it was not ugliness that led me to dishonor it was evil he came from a fine home and where i come from that means a wealthy one with a lineage stretching back untold generations i come from such a home myself my lineage is pure untainted by commoners or foreigners it stretches all the way back to the first emperor i can recite my lineage from memory and i know with absolute certainty that i am our emperors fifth cousin thrice removed of course what noblewoman of any worth could not say the same his family is richer than ours through its connection to clan kuroda but their blood is less pure and the real nobles look down on them because of it but they are wealthy and wealth counts for a great deal anywhere but especially at home and so we were the perfect match through me our children would gain pure blood unspoiled by the taint of commoners through him they would gain vast wealth huge tracts of farmland rich in rice if only he could have contented himself with that much i would not be here today but he wanted more he wanted my familys lands he wanted our position in society i was to be his means of attaining those goals as his wife should my parents and my brother die he would inherit everything through me and so that was precisely what he arranged to do he planned to murder my entire family on the day of our wedding i was not meant to overhear but i did of course i told my father he even believed me but it didnt matter the marriage contract had been signed between my husband and my father there was no escaping it not without loss of face not without loss of honor my father knew that assassins would seek to murder him if the wedding went forward but for the sake of honor he did not flinch i wish i were my fathers daughter i wish i had such fortitude such courage but whether through fate or through my own personal failings i do not have his strength of spirit i could not bear to see my family destroyed so i ran away i stole a soldiers uniform and i ran as fast and as far as i could i ruined everything my fathers business contacts have suffered enormously he has lost face the other nobles scorn him now for raising a willful disobedient daughter for no two words are so carefully calculated to bring dishonor on a girl than those a proper young lady is obedient pliant respectful she does not get ideas into her own head she does not run off without permission she does not humiliate her father by breaking a sacred marriage contract and so in spite of years of training in flower arrangement calligraphy tea ceremony the keeping of hawks and the use of the naginata i am forced to conclude that i am not a proper young lady after all what does that make me an exile an outcast those things to be sure but what else what skills do i possess to make my way in the world though i stole the uniform and the armor of a soldier i am not a warrior not in truth nor am i a performer  no one will pay hardearned silver to hear me play the flute i am not an innkeeper though i brew a very fine dragons breath oolong the reality is that i was raised for one task and one task alone  to be a proper noblewoman i was trained from an early age to manage a household to command servants and bodyguards to fight if necessary to dictate the dispositions of armies if it came to it but mostly to serve i was trained to serve tea to important men with a smile i was trained to sit quietly and listen attentively to act as the deferential hostess a welcoming presence to every important visitor what use is there for such a creature in this terrible place so far from my beloved island in truth i am not even sure which terrible place this is i know only that i am surrounded by foreigners and by demons  demons with pointy ears and demons with pointy teeth their dialect which is difficult to follow and i miss as many words as i comprehend the pointy toothed demons are usually content to growl in my direction which sends me scurrying away from them quickly enough i am welltrained in fighting with the naginata but what hope do i have in a duel against a battlescarred demon every instinct i have has been cultivated to bow to them and serve them tea not growl and fight back if i could run home i would i would give anything to kowtow before my father and beg his forgiveness but i cant if i return home i will be forced to marry my betrothed and in marrying him i will sign my familys death warrants it may yet come to that he is honorbound to find me so far as the law is concerned i am a piece of wayward property and it is his duty to retrieve me i live in constant fear that he will come for me he will not come alone not to a place such as this if he comes  when he comes it will be with stout soldiers at his side with the finest weapons in his hands and with the force of the law and tradition at his back and so i must keep running i must hide myself in this wilderness hide myself amongst foreigners and demons i must never ever let him find me for my fathers sake for my mothers sake for my brothers sake i will never go home againplayed byemily vakos ervakosgmailcom name ryla larksfield formerly blackthorne gender female age late twenties race human hair dark brown eyes brown

parents she was abandoned to and raised by one of the local temples though her time there left her with a favorable view of religion and the religiously devout she has since found other deities that better fit her lifestyle though theyre intentions were noble there is only so much a few priestesses can do with a temple full of gaping mouths at age 9 ryla left the temple to make her own way on the streets while it wasnt all wine and roses naturally ryla found the streets more than adequately comfortable she learned quickly and well how valuable friends were and made them every chance she got when she needed protection she befriended those slightly older and stronger than herself when she needed food she befriended a fish monger it cost her dearly the last coin in her purse was almost always spent buying some new friend a drink but she never starved or froze while her peers learned the fine arts of cutpursing and begging ryla learned to trade in favors and information by the age of 19 she was well established as a capable and reliable fixer with a few more years in the citys underworld she would have been well off indeed but it was not to be eight years ago the nation of aldoria fell and ryla was forced to leave her beloved city for the unconquered wilds of mardrun in the months leading to the evacuation she spent every asset available to her buying a new life on mardrun for those who had no means of escape on their own if asked about it shell simply give you a bitten smirk and remind you that the flood of dead from aldoria was still enough to push the living off of faedrun forever she arrived on the new continent penniless and nearly friendless and certainly would have been easy prey for the tamest of mordock had it not been for a mercenary named duncan

and persistence and he agreed to play a game against her they became friends quickly meeting at the winter apple whenever duncans business brought him to the port when the undead pushed in on dellastern duncan rushed to the citys defense and the two stole a moment for a final game much to his dismay ryla intended to save one more life drugged his beer and had him dragged aboard a ship bound for mardrun though incensed at first he eventual forgave ryla and the two decided to stick together when they landed on the new continent but the princess of aldoria ryla was not and duncan would be damned if he was going to give her a free ride in a harsh new world he taught her how to use a sword and fight and the two settled into mercenary work protecting caravans and travelers rylas new talent with a blade was mediocre at best but the measured caution of her youth had relaxed in duncans company and for the first time in her life she became cocky despite duncans warnings she became more and more reckless with her safety while on a relatively routine guard job roughly three and a half years ago ryla got into a bit of trouble and would have lost her head if duncan hadnt come to her aid but in so doing he sustained a horrible wound that nearly killed him he was nursed back to health by a healer named erin and through his recovery the two fell in love when he was fully healed he and erin settled in new aldoria and were married ryla feeling depthless guilt stayed by his side through his recovery and into his new life with erin she got a job at a butchers and the three lived a quiet happy life for a little over a year but it soon became obvious that though ryla loved her new family dearly she was growing restless duncan and erin took matters into their own hands bought her new gear and forced her to take a guard job traveling to new hope they bid their farewells telling her that she would always be welcome to visit thus ryla found herself on the road

appearance longish brown curly hair 54 glasses notable traits glasses i grew up in a small modest cottage with my mother father younger sister and big brother who i idolized at a young age i decided i wanted to become a cleric so i could help heal the wounded one day when i was out healing a birds wing i stumbled upon a man with a wounded leg his face was caked with grime but he seemed friendly enough so i helped heal him and in return he gave me a bow when he first tried to hand it to me i just looked at it stupidly i was extremely confused i had no idea how to use a bow so why would he want to give me one i had no use for it he finally handed it to me and began to explain the basics when he noticed me still staring at it with confusion he sighed and mumbled something that sounded like ignorant child under his breath he took it from me obviously trying to be patient and showed me how i should hold it before handing it back to me this time i held the bow correctly but when i tried to shoot an arrow it nearly hit the man he dropped to the ground as the arrow flew over his head then stood again and dusted himself off i could tell his patience was wearing thin i was ready to give him the bow back but then he started setting up makeshift targets for me to shoot at i felt guilty because a couple of the targets were apples he took out of his mostly empty nap sack he may go to sleep hungry one night because of those missing apples and it would be my fault i started to voice my objections but he just waved them away and continued his work once he was finished with setting up the targets he stood beside me helping me aim with his help i was able to hit a target even though my success was mostly due to his help i was still excited when the arrow hit he retrieved the arrow handed it to me and told me it was time to shoot by myself thankfully he took some measures to protect himself and stood behind me this time safely out of my way i nocked the arrow drew back and let it fly but  my eyes were closed so i didnt even know i hit the target until i heard him clapping and laughing what a lucky shot and even with your eyes closed at that i peeked one eye open and saw that what he said was true next time little one keep both eyes open with that he patted me on the head and left every day after that i would go to the same spot set up my targets and practice shooting my bow secretly i wondered if he would ever return a part of me hoped he would so i could show him how much better i was now i could hit an apple half the time and my speed was improving too when i wasnt shooting my bow or healing injured animals i would spend my days playing with my sister or following my big brother around my family was extremely close and even our extended family lived only minutes away so when my brother puckerman left one day i was surprised and upset it didnt help that i was angry at him when he left brother i want to come with you puckerman shook his head you cant

there are no townsfolk left another soldier runs up from the boats sergeant all the towns people are on the boats the sergeant turns good we must wait for commander nikiri and the rest of the men go back to the boats and keep everyone calm right away the soldier runs back to the boats and the sergeant waits at the edge of the docks looking up towards the front gate the rain is falling hard drowning out almost all noise yet you can hear the faint sounds of battle in the distance several minuets pass and then he sees movement in the distance as it gets closer he sees that its the men that where fighting at the gate this way quickly we must board the boats quickly the large number of soldiers run past a few soldiers being helped or carried by others as the last man passes the sergeant turns and quickly follows as he steps onto the boat the lines are cut and the boat is pushed away from the docks as the wind catches the sails the boat is pulled out to sea he turns and looks to the small town for one last time as he sees undead poring through the gate and sweeping over the town like a flood he watches for a moment then turns away and goes below decks to rest several weeks past as they sailed no one knew how long they have been sailing they managed to stay fed with what supplies they had on board as well as what they managed to catch they encountered a few minor squalls but nothing to major as the small fleet sailed one night he is suddenly woken up by getting tossed to the ground by the ships rocking as he gets his bearings he notices the boat being thrown from side to side and the sound of wind howling rain and waves pounding the deck he quickly gets up and works his way the top deck where men are scrambling to get control of the sail that has broken lose from the wind as men clamber about getting tossed around with the boat he tries to work his way to a group of men that are trying to tie down one of the ropes for the sail he rushes over to assist but as he passes the mast a large wave comes over the rail and crashes onto the deck he gets swept up and smashed into the mast getting knocked unconscious and thrown overboard he then slowly begins to wake up as he opens his eyes he finds himself floating on a large board just off shore of unknown shores he gathers what strength he has left and swims to shore as he gets onto the beach he lays there for a while and then passes out he awakes to an unfamiliar room the house belonged to a small family that took him in and started to nurse his wounds several months later he has left the town and the family

passed on his trip be came into contact with a feral syndar named pan a while after they reached the village he was tasked with watching over the fire and to keep it going he was in the process of thinking as to what he should do next after the village is built he did not belong with these townspeople then pan sat by the fire and they talked a bit she asked if he would care to join them and he saw it as the opportunity he needed to get back to what he was good at and get away from the life of a simple wood cutter shortly after the town was secured he left with them to a city where he was able to have a blacksmith make him the equipment he needed now armed with a good sword and protected with fine armor that he was used to he felt like his old self and felt he had a purpose again he

take them to their teacher three times a week since i was already there with them i figured it wouldnt hurt to learn too in case they needed help with it at home i didnt choose healing over fighting i

the first place i wanted to see was the vast blue oceans that my grandparents came on from the old land it didnt live up to the stories i had heard about it it was just a big salty lake the vast country side was beautiful but with it came its troubles i had always thought when i faced my first enemy i would rise up and defeat it earning a tale to tell to all that would listen instead i ended up running away from the three bandits that crossed my path the second time i would face real danger would be a year later it would also be where i met my leader i had just arrived at a small village

himself the other two seemed happy to oblige standing next to the cliff i didnt see what was going on around me just the enemy trying to kill me with his bare hands i noticed a green blur dart from the woods towards the two onlooking mordok it collided with one sending it careening over the cliffs edge quickly turning to draw its swords squaring off against the remaining foe i struggled as long as i could all the while sounds of steel and wood colliding told me the blur was still fighting my strength began to wane and the mordok pressed the advantage just when it seamed he had me his attention was drawn away the blur who i could now see was a man in a green hood had just dispatched his foe wiping the dark blood from his blade the mordok got up and ran at the man intent on throwing him over the ledge they struggled until they both fell over the cliff but when i got to the edge the man was barely hanging on to a root jutting from the cliff face after i helped him up he wasted no time in siting down in front of the fire looking at me and with a big hearty grin asked so whats for supper we hit it off rather well he told me of the group he was making and how he needed strong men to help in the fight at the time he had no members and was beginning to lose faith he would ever have the brave men he needed he asked me to join him in looking for brave men maybe we can even turn you into one so i went with him and we found others to join up and serve under the green hood of the rangers i was given the position of second in command though i did not want the responsibilities i

raining the day my parents were brutally murdered by the attacks of the penitent we had heard screams coming for what seemed like hours before they finally attacked my mother marie and my father torvald hid with me in the small inlet beneath the stone staircase that connected the basement to the rest of our house moments passed like hours as the beads of sweat on my forehead slid down my face i could feel my heart pounding on my temples i knew something was about to go wrong the moment i heard our door slam to the ground my mother cupped her hand around my mouth to try and silence the imminent terror that was about to overtake me i could hear footsteps tracing their way across the floor upstairs each one caused my stomach to sink lower and lower after a few more thuds my father finally stood up he turned around with a look in his eyesa look that i was not familiar with i know now that it was the look of utter defeat but back then i just thought it was fear he nodded and without saying anything he brushed our cheeks and walked up the stairs slowly after he left mother stood up and started covering the area we were hiding in with rags and sheets in an attempt to camouflage it she settled back in next to me and went silent a few seconds of unbearable silence passed before i heard the unforgettable schlik of a sword sliding through the flesh of someones neck there were no screams only laughtera laugh that most certainly didnt belong to my father the footsteps of the invader began making their way down the stone steps mother kissed my head held her breath and pushed her way out of the hiding place a few tears ran down her face to this day those moments still haunt me if she hadnt gone out there and distracted the man he wouldve found both of us i bit my lip as my mothers scream pierced the silence followed shortly by the thud of her decapitated head hitting the floor i still dont know why the man didnt check the area more thoroughly but he left shortly after killing them i really try not to question it perhaps it was a favor from the gods i dont know all i knew at the time was that i was a newly orphaned ten year old living in the house where my parents were murdered in a city that had just been raided i knew i had to get out and with no family and nowhere to go i sought refuge in vandregon knowing that a country with a larger army would stand a far better chance against whatever it was that had raided us the trek took me many days my mother being an alchemist had been teaching me her art since i was about five years old if i hadnt known how to make basic medicines and poisons i dont think i couldve made it there by myself im still not sure how i did it i was a resilient child i arrived just in time to see that vandregon wasnt doing as well as i had hoped they were at war and the raids were already happening i had heard speak about ships leaving out of the port for a new continent knowing it could very well be my only hope i stowed away on the first ship i could find on the ship i made very few friends save one elijah cole he helped me stay hidden and in exchange i showed him my knowledge of alchemy while i claimed that i was the thing i had always strived to be the greatest alchemist of all time when we finally made it to mardrun elijah and i parted ways i began working on my alchemy hoping to make a career out of it over time i picked up a few swordfighting techniques to help me get by when times were tough after about 15 years i asked to join a faction called the rangers as they were in need of an alchemist and i was in need of a stable job they seemed like a tight family that would watch my back as i watched theirs it was then that i was reunited with elijah the one whom had actually pulled

and says what about the towns people have they been put on the boats the soldier replies yes sir theyre just waiting on us commander nikiri hmm good get to the boat i will go to the gate and have the men fall back soldier yes sir as the soldier runs out of the building the commander puts his helmet on picks up his spear and shield takes one last looks around the room then walks out into the rain

made the oath he took when he joined the guard the focus of his life to guard and protect the people of the town and people who are in need to do right wherever he can he was raised to treat people with respect and honor but he hates the dishonorable those that would take advantage of the weak he only tells his name to the people that have truly earned his trust and respect as a result of his personality he rose quickly through the ranks of the town guard and became the youngest commander the small town has had as commander nikiri runs up onto the gate he sees the men manning the watch towers firing arrows down into the undead ranks men on the ground are bracing against the gate doing their best to hold it shut one of the soldiers notices commander nikiri and shouts commander they will break through any moment now the commander shouts back everyone pull back and board the ships move it all the soldiers shout yes sir and start running back to the docks just as they reach the street to the docks the gate breaks open and undead start to pour through a soldier shouts oh crap they broke through commander nikiri shouts back double time to the boats people right as he turns to start running something hits him in the back of the head and he falls to the ground he hears a soldier shout commander come on guys pick him up we need to get him to the ship he feels them start to

hears wood crack and someone shouting for a bucket then blacks out again he awakes again but this time hes lying on a beach as he gets up he sees wreckage all around him he looks inland and says to himself these are not the shores of the mainland he starts walking down the beach in search of supplies and equipment he manages to find a spear and shield but nothing else he decides to head inland to see if he can find some food or maybe a town over time he manages to find food and a town but he has never seen these people before he manages to get some supplies he couldnt get any information from the colonists since he felt like they didnt want him there so once he got his supplies he left town and started wandering through his travels he gathers plants to make food with and eventually he was able to make more than he needs he now sells the extra food he makes and hires out as a short time mercenary for some extra money he keeps wandering and exploring this land that he has washed up on in peace occasionally stopping to talk to someone that isnt there he hasnt found any trace of his people that came with him from valdell how could they all have disappeared what are the odds that he would be the only survivor when he wasnt even conscious when the boat wrecked during his wanderings he always keeps a sharp eye for a familiar face and is determined to find out what happened to his people yet it seems he cannot escape war in his travels he has heard whispers of battles and a growing war and he feels that he will be swept up in it at some point if he is forced to join in the

recall my parents but i remember the warmth of kind hands on my face and their smell of ginger and incense they loved me quite dearly this i know when i was young my family and i were forced to flee maykar after the vandregon army wiped out the city we became refugees in the kingdom of aldoria we were never rich and most of our possessions had been left behind so that we could travel quick and light when we arrived in aldoria we were exhausted confused and quite poor i recall that we rented a very small room for all three of us with other refugees it was only meant until my mother and father could find work however it seemed that no sooner had we arrived fate would uproot us once again the undead plague that had washed across the land was tightening its noose around all the human kingdoms aldoria was sending ships across the sea to save as many citizens as possible one of my most vivid memories was of my mother and father shoving me onto one of the ships heading to mardrun the meager amount of coin that was left was sent in my pockets i have not seen my parents since i know that they now wander a ruined land with milky eyes and lipless faces i knew no one on the ship but there were a few sympathetic people that were willing to keep an eye on me however when we landed in new hope i was quite alone the pittance that i had come with quickly dwindled and i fell through the cracks to become a street child i did many things that i am not proud of i stole and lied to survive when i became older and attractive enough i taught myself to dance and sing from other ladies of the night they taught me how to smile and flash my teeth for coin i learned to give compliments to make a person feel wanted i found that selling my body and my pretty words was a much steadier income than stealing though sometimes it was just as dangerous i gained a certain amount of steady clientele and was able to afford to eat properly each day when i was about twenty i learned of a syndar with a growing business in new hope i was told it was a mish mash of a place both a brothel a shop and a pub intrigued i searched for the shop and met the enigmatic marrah faile she offered me a permanent place of employ with the assurance of food and safety i agreed to become one of her girls and wore her mark proudly marrah was quite kind to me she gave me lovely clothes and jewelry she also gave me a place to rest my head each night that did not leak she was not only my madam but a very dear friend i was quite content to spend my young adulthood as a companion and perhaps work my way up to a secretary of sorts for her but that all changed when i met her i had traveled with marrah in the heat of summer to the wolfs hackles we had set up a tent to offer comfort and supplies to the warriors there many of them were ulven i had serviced a few before but they were not a common client for me it was interesting to see so many one in particular caught my eye and when she did all thought left my head her name was brynja blackpaw a fearsome warrior with eyes that shone like gems despite my duties i found myself drawn to her as if by an unseen force and she to me  we fell madly in love and in that madness brynja purchased my freedom now i travel with her learning the ulven ways each day i am training and learning so that i may prove myself to the pack that i am worthy of being part of it but truth be told it is more about proving it to myself each day i work hard to become stronger braver and wiser my path has finally become clear to me i feel that a new dawn in my

though they taught him politics economy battle tactics and more it seemed that mordecai was living the dream life of luxury and safety inside his familys estate but that all changed on mordecais 11th birthday early in the morning hours of the day an undead horde launched an attack on the von hertz estate the undead were merciless as they slaughtered every servant and guard in their way it seemed like nothing would be able to stop the devastation that was being wreaked upon mordecais home in an effort to protect his beloved family grigori grabbed the familys ancestoral sword and shield and went out to meet the vile scum that was the undead it was the last time mordecai would ever see his father alive again finally realizing that the estate was soon to be totally lost margaret ordered mordecai escorted away from the estate with two guards through a secret underground tunnel leading out the back of the doomed home while she would remain behind to find her husband the guards and mordecai pleaded margaret to go with them and after a few minutes convinced her to abandon the house but fate was not done being cruel to mordecai on this day as they finally reached the entrance of the tunnel a lone undead had broken off from its pack and impaled margaret straight through her chest mordecai watched as two more undead appeared and began to mutilate his mothers body right before his eyes even to this day he can remember the sheer agony in his mothers voice as her final breathes of air left her body finally snapping back into reality mordecai ran down the tunnel as the two guards who were accompanying him stayed behind to buy him time to escape as mordecai reached the end of the tunnel he turned to see his once glorious home engulfed in flames not knowing what to do next mordecai turned around and started to walk away from everything he held close and dear to his heart after walking for a couple hours mordecai stumbled across a boat that was taking people to new lands upon seeing this mordecai ran to the boat to see if someone would answer his call for help as he neared the boat mordecai breathed a sigh of relief for the first time that day as there on the boat was the ships captain and a small amount of people preparing to set sail for mardrun they quickly invited mordecai onboard and offered the battered young boy some food he quickly devoured it and then proceeded to tell them of everything that had happened that morning leading up to his arrival at the boat taking pity on the young lad the captain decided to let mordecai stay the night with them the very next day the captain and mordecai set back out towards the von hertz estate to see if there were any survivors and see what became of mordecais father as they approached the smoldering estate they advanced with extreme caution for fear of any undead that may still be lingering nearby after finally feeling that there were no undead still remaining around they began to look for any signs that may help them ascertain the fate of grigori after an hour of digging through the rubble and ashes they found what they were looking for it was the charred corpse of grigori as it was made apparent by the ancestral sword and shield of the family that were still clasped in his hands apparently as grigori went out to protect his family a beam of the house weakened by the fires fell onto him and crushed him where he stood mordecais worst fear had finally come to pass his entire family was dead and gone there was now nothing left for mordecai here except memories that would haunt him for the rest of his life before leaving though mordecai decided to take the familys ancestral sword and shield from his fathers corpse as he picked up the sword and shield mordecai realized that the fire had charred the blade and shield pure black mordecai decided at that moment that he would use his familys ancestral weapons to fight and protect all the good in the world from evil so that no one else would experience the pain he had felt mordecai gave his last respects to his family and vowed to one day restore the house of von hertz back to its former glory upon returning to the boat the captain feeling sympathy for the now orphaned boy decided to take mordecai with them to mardrun after arriving in the new lands of mardrun mordecai spent the next 3 years of his life learning the virtues of a noble gentleman like honor respect and how to judge what is good and righteous that aught be protected from the evil injustice that aught be destroyed mordecai also recalled the lessons of his fighting tutors had taught him and trained vigorously night and day to master what he could not 6 years ago after spending the 3 years with the captain aboard his ship he finally decided it was time to set out and try to keep the oaths that he had made years ago on the graves of his family before mordecai left the boat the captain gave mordecai a gift to help him on his noble trek and give him luck as it had done for the captain the captains swords mordecai spent the next 7 years wandering the country side fighting any evil that he came across living off what small amount of money he had received from the captain and dead corpses he looted in these 7 years of traveling that he had done mordecai heard rumors of an army that helped the good people of mardrun and killed the wicked this army went by the name of vandregon mordecai had heard that they supposedly had a headquarters in the colony of new hope and was led by a man named william deciding to see for himself if the vandregon army did exist mordecai set out for new hope in the hopes of finding william he had decided that if the rumors were true he must join this righteous army and aid them however he could and in the process maybe just maybe mordecai could become just that much closer to restoring his family name and home but that remains to be seenplayed by juilan boehm character name moe sphere gender male

become faedruns best as his brews were enjoyed heavily among the aldorian nobles learning to transfer his brew master skills into that of an alchemist his trade took off even further as a few years passed he had become better than those he learned from moving on to newer and better towns he eventually opened a tavern all his own the pie house named after his signature brew the business flourished and he hired on help quite steadily yet he still kept the entire brewing process all to himself although people asked him many a time he kept quiet often telling tall tales about how he plucked a chicken for a single feather to mix the entire batch when word of the undead within the city reached them he wrote it off as drunken rabble the man tumbled head first through his door and onto the floor voice cracking wheezing with hiccups he babbled about the hordes as they struck down towns not too far from there handing the man a bottle of brew and a silver piece he guided the gent to the door and let him out laughter peeling across the tavern as people jested with each other ridiculing the man as they presumed he ran on to tell his tale once more undead had never been able to breach this far into the city they had taken care of them and only the outter lying towns need fear staying late that night he tended to his brew the great barrels stated the back of the storage hall were hauled up front to make room for his next batch the groans were soft as scuffles echoed in from outside his wheelbarrow full he iced the door open to find himself staring into dead eyes the monster let out a scattering screech as it lunged for him eyes wide with hunger its call made more turn shoving the wheelbarrow at it he turned for the rear entrance shuffling multiplied behind him soon a shatter of glass rang in his ears turning his head he could barely see the fire from his overturned lantern licking at the barrels of brew like a desperate drunkard his heart pounded as he ran faster throwing open the door and bashing the lock closed unable to contain his horror any longer he screamed as lights appeared so did more of the horde panic ensued as people ran from their homes and into the thing it turned into a bloodbath the central square awash with the thudding of feet and groans of monsters a loud boom roared from behind him as the brewery went up in flames undead poured from the now broken door fire coating their bodies as they walked into pandemonium the fire spread as people ran for the woods neighboring villages for safety his legs started moving arms pumping lungs burned as his instincts took him far away dodging around bodies lunging undead to the dark safety of the forest unwilling to stay any longer he boarded the boats a week later arriving on mardrun he took to his old ways brewing and running tavern but finding consistent customers was not as easy as it used to be he turned to travel both to gather more clientele and to ease his troubled

father coming home from work very stressed and angry my parents would fight while they thought i was asleep in bed i heard their murmurs about the war and undead attacks i knew my father wanted to leave the king had already abandoned us and so too did others however we stayed for my mothers sake she was born and raised in that small one story house she was always telling us that there were too many memories floating around for her to ever want to leave eventually the war got too close to home and we were forced to evacuate i remember seeing my mother screaming with tears in her eyes as father dragged her away from the only place she knew father put us on a boat saying we were going on an adventure to a faraway place the journey started out fun and exciting for my current eight year old self but soon turned into the worst days of my life sickness spread around the hall and soon my brother and i became sick i still can only remember being so sick and mothers teary eyes as she told me my little brother had gone to a better place finally we made it to land i was still recovering from the illness when we landed and everything after that is hazy to me when i came to i was at a small town that went by the name crows landing the people were very accepting of us and we fit in well at first i was a fragile young girl that had just lost her brother at the time but over the years i learned to become the woman i am today the winters became increasingly hard for the town and for many years we struggled to get by the government at crows landing became corrupt and started spending money they didnt have for reasons nobody understood this led my family to turn inwards for help and we mostly relied on our own resources to get by during these troubling times i started to develop a liking to herbology because it was the only way my parents would let me help at the time i would take long walks into the woods and pick herbs for the family to get away from everything happening in town finally relief came in the form of visitors wearing red and green they saw the state of our little town and decided to help us for reasons i cannot even explain they brought us the resources and materials we desperately needed and soon our town was thriving once again now that i am older and my parents are being taken care of i have a strong urge to spread my wings i met some people on my adventures into the woods they called themselves the rangers one even told me that if i learned to fight i would make a good asset to their group because of my herbology background i went home that day and picked up a sword when that had failed because of my petite stature i found a bow and arrow ever since then i have been honing my skills in archery so that i could one day join the odd men i

the madam of the house took care of me either because my mother was working or was too drunk to do anything the madam as she liked to be called was a ruthless and uncaring woman the only reason i was able to get food from her was because i was good at retrieving things i had a gift a deftness that allowed me to steal items without being caught or if i was caught i was able to run away good thing valinate was a maze of back alleys and blind spots in my spare time i would wander into the sewers and find my way through the tunnels making note of escape routes and what entrance led to where that

i learned always exploit a weakness always take the cheap shots to never give up and you might live to retire at least that is what he would say though he never really explained what that word meant

tall guy with a shield as big as me named bob we where an hours walk from the village when it happened i heard a sharp sound from the trees and felt so much pain in my chest it made me fall to the ground an arrow was sticking out of my chest the pain was so great i heard the sound of fighting i could barley keep my eyes open i saw five men pushing out of the woods three had bows it was then i saw that nickoli had been hit as well two arrows stuck out of his back bob had taken to fighting the two men that had ran in with swords drawn puckermen came to my side and pulled me to my feet he yelled at me fight the rest is a blur i didnt do much bob killed three of them and puckermen killed one more but the third archer ran into the woods we let him get away puckermen healed nickoli while

start this journal if i am writing about the glory of arnath or translating his manuscripts then the pen flows quite easily to write about myself is quite a monumental task i suppose i should start at the beginning of my life unlike many i was blessed with little memory of my homeland faedrun i was only a toddler when we had left my parents had been members of the order of arnath and as such had been able to secure passage to the new world for myself and my siblings i am very fortunate in this respect because some of my siblings are old enough to recall the horrors of that cursed land and i am glad to not have memory of the terrible things they witnessed most of my earliest memories are all of starkhaven the building of the keep and my little family i learned of the brilliance of arnath while sitting on my mothers knee and my father would take me out into the town and point out the little works of arnath a person sharing their coin with the less fortunate a child standing up to bullies a woman giving out food at the market to those who couldnt afford it were all blessings to be observed and lessons to be learned see arnaths path in all the good that you find my father would say for his is the path of righteousness goodness and kindness naturally i was also taught about his blazing justice i recall seeing the lions the griffins and the eagles all in their shining armor and scarlet robes how could one not love them how could one not be filled with hope how could your heart not be set aflame with love for arnath and his chosen defenders  forgive me see how easy it is for me to be carried away when i think of him anyhow when i reached an age of slightly higher reasoning i believe it was around the age of six i asked my parents to allow me to join the order naturally they were thrilled to give one of their many children to the order of arnath i was a fitting gift to the god who had guided them from the bloodstained land of the dead to the new green world we all lived comfortably in of course our parting was painful but it was a sacrifice that both my parents and i happily made upon entering into the arms of the order of arnath however i learned it would be a challenge to find my place i quickly discovered that combat was not exactly my strongest skill i nearly killed the bow instructor the shields were too cumbersome for my frame i tripped far too often to be remotely successful in stealthier approaches and without my spectacles i couldnt even scout very well after a few years of attempted combat training i was shuffled off to become a scribe and it was there i found my love of books i learned quickly that there is nothing quite as enjoyable as the smell of parchment the gentle rustle of turning pages the feeling of ancient scrolls the moment i stepped into the library i knew that was where i was meant to be i fell under the wing of a kindly older sister while i was there it was clear she had been delivered to me by arnath because in her tender care my love of our god and his knowledge only bloomed my love and devotion for arnath manifested itself the gift of divine magic when i was somewhat older and it wasnt long after that i became an official sister in the order now for the most part i spend my days happily pouring over dusty tomes scouring ancient manuscripts and squinting at crumbling scrolls each day is filled with his light as i search for a way to bring about an end to the corruption magic and hunt for hidden knowledge of the undead i really couldnt be more over joyed arnath has blessed me with a

bitter but pleasing brew marcus felt good he and brodin made it to new hope without further issue after nearly dying outside the hidden gem inn thanks to fritha and her ulven companions for saving their lives since he and brodin made it to new hope it has been a flutter of activity well mostly for brodin with him completing his task for the pheonix and now has set up a small stall with his silver smithing shop to make some coin during their stay marcus well he has helped out with some tedious paperwork for the phoenix went hunting a couple times and a few fishing excursions but mostly it seems like he just goes from tavern to tavern sampling beers and learning what gossip or information that he can a great many people suggest groups that he can join up with to find direction and purpose one shady individual with an affinity for whiskey suggested that a pirate group might be interested ha the notion marcus clearbrook being a pirate the notion felt so absurd that marcus noticeably chuckled out loud at the other end of the small tavern sat a man with a shiny dented breastplate that reflected light which shone through a nearby window is something funny sir he asked pointedly marcus turned to face the man and sized him up briefly the man was of a large build similar to himself short cropped beard and an assortment of scars that patched his face this wasnt a man to fool with marcus thought im sure that whatever caused those scars didnt live very long to tell the tale nothing at all just happy for the prospect of an early spring care for a tankard of this interesting dark ale marcus asked kindly aye i have tried the innkeepers brew before but this is definitely his best batch marcus retrieved another tankard for the stranger and went to join him at his small round table as he sat down he sized him up even more this man had a very odd assortment of clothing bright red and black clothes with all different patterns and his helm was decorated with multiple red feathers marcus thought it was odd but he wasnt about to point it out to this gentleman where are you from the stranger said new aldoria recently aldoria before coming to mardun marcus said oh really how did you end up here he asked before marcus could ask his own question that is a pretty long and drawn out story it would take us deep into the night marcus stated matter of a fact i will take the abbreviated version if you have one i have to check up on my troops in a little while he said glancing outside well i was born in little farming community called arkos my mother taught me to read and write and keep a garden my father taught me to hunt and hold many of the morals and standards that i have today my family was killed by the undead advancement into aldoria when i was 10 or 11 i cant remember i narrowly escaped with my life caught a boat bound to mardrun settled in new aldoria for the next 10 or so years that is where i learned how to inventory cargo and keep a tight schedule i developed a love of beer and a hate of many greedy and selfish people i also honed my skills for skinning and butchering for an elderly tanner eventually i was forced to leave because of corrupt guards and people who didnt stand up for me after i helped them out more than i should have i fled toward new hope during this last winter which wasnt easy i saved a now current friend of mine from a group of bandits we nearly died in last months horrendous blizzard but we were narrowly saved by a band of ulven which makes me really appreciate them all the more after that experience we made our way here where he has traveled for the phoenix for now me i am still looking for my calling marcus said as he looked thoughtfully in his dark beer no reflection or words of wisdom in the cold brew the flamboyantly clad stranger looked at marcus sternly have you killed a man he asked without feeling yes to save those i thought needed help i dont kill for pleasure or because they have something i want i am of a mind to work hard for whatever i want marcus said with passion and what do you want he asked while looking at marcus with intense blue eyes marcus looked out the window to see a man hauling wood in a hand cart a couple small kids happy to be outside without fear of being horribly cold or getting sick then he met the strangers gaze i want to help people that cant help themselves i want to make this place a better place for ulven syndar and human alike i dont have much money and dont have a lot of training in a trade i would rather know a lot of things do them fairly well than to be an expert at one thing i want to help like i have been given help i want direction without someone taking advantage of me marcus broke the man gaze and thought that either this is a very strong brew or it has been a very odd couple of months he never used to be this open with strangers the stranger looked at him and then outside he finished his tankard with one long chug and got up i must be off i thank you for the great brew and the abbreviated tale i must get going to review my troops i will see you tomorrow the stranger turned to leave his rapier clanging the chair as he turned this sudden statement left marcus flabbergasted and wanting wait what do you mean that you will see me tomorrow and as a matter of fact where marcus said excitedly and confused the stranger turned oh didnt i tell you silly of me i am going to train you to fight i have need of people like you we will be leaving in the morning be there at dawn and we will draw up papers of your enlistment and if you do not show then i will assume that you decided to enjoy your life as a futureless drifter in a land that is neither his and becoming more inhospitable by the season now is the time for you to learn how to fight so you can be either a valuable asset or a worthy challenge in the shaping of mardrun good day the gaily dressed warrior opened the door donned his flamboyant helm and strutted down the street marcus watched him leave drained his tankard got up and walked to the thin innkeeper whipping down a wine goblet i will take another tankard of this fine brew and then i must be off i must tell

in great pain my father said the amount of pain he witnessed his beloved wife and mother of his first unborn child go through made him nearly go mad with panic he didnt know what to do the only thing he did know was that his mother would know what to do he told me he went on a short journey into the dark forest to find her you see my grandmother was what you would call a hermit of sorts she stayed in the woods for the most part according to my father never really venturing into the town some of the towns folk were afraid of her but not my brave father after he had drug my grandmother out of the house and out of the woods he had to let her be alone with my mother unfortunately after she did all she could my mother died during childbirth my grandmother held me and wept this saddened my father delving him into a depression that he couldnt seem to shake my mother had died and all he had was me and my grandmother throughout my youth as i grew older i could see the sadness my father held on his shoulders he would occasionally go speak with grandmother but told me i could never meet her i never understood why and when i would ask my father would always answer vaguely i remember the day my father disappeared though my father left the house at the normal time that he did every other week on wednesday afternoon for the market it was mid fall winter slowly making its way but the sun still

option though because i needed my father he was all i had he was my teacher my friend and my father so i had to get over my fear and go into the woods i searched for a little shack till dawn break exhausted and hungry i sat down at the base of a mighty oak thats when i saw it deep into the forest between the trees i swore i saw a roof reflecting the blue of the morning i got up and started to

down my legs and dirt all over my pretty dress and hands walking up to the old shack i saw candle light through a crack so when i got up to the door i tried to push it open but it was locked i knocked nothing i yelled nothing i banged as hard as a six year old girl could smash her fists on a door giving up in the middle of the woods the early rays of morning shining through the trees i started to cry sliding down the door panel there is where i fell asleep until i got woken up by falling inside the shack looking up at a grizzly old woman she looked at me like i had just fallen into her house or something she asked what i was doing i asked frantically where my dad was she asked what i was doing and i asked if shed seen my father finally she looked at me grabbed my shoulders and whispered in my ear that my father was dead i slapped her right across the face being feisty and six not having that as an answer i screamed where is he she grabbed me and brought me into her shack first off

grandfather vazra our family has long held that he did not fall in his fight with the death knight i have personally heard accounts of a bright flash of blue light surrounding both of them as vazra alone vanished from the field if there was anyone who could have survived such a thing it would have been vazra if you work hard at expanding your mind you may be able to reach some of the great peaks of power vazra tread on before he left us you may be able to discover his fate my mother your grandmother sheila will help you do not shy away from her she is an odd woman frightening even but listen

floor crying youre not a baby jumping forward seven years im thirteen and grew up in the woods with my grandmother i can however read fluently which is glorious i found i love reading i have my things

father he did what he did out of care not spite or anger and i still love him and know hes watching over me my grandmother told me of the fond secretive love between her and vazra vazra vanished before my father was born oddly she didnt hate vazra she was just saddened by him but loved my father anyways in an odd standoffish kind of way but still love one day mid training my grandmother suddenly stiffened and informed me that we were taking a trip to the coast and that i should bring everything that i found valuable while i found this odd i packed my few prized possessions and followed her down the road after a few days travel we came to a port city and my grandmother marched us straight to the docks once there she found a man selling passage on a ship to mardrun and passed him a small bracelet i had never seen before he looked at it dismissively until she placed it in his hand and it suddenly shone with mana this will do is all he said then he pointed to the ship my grandmother started shoving me towards the ship despite my protests as her plan dawned on me i need to find out what happened to vazra i shouted she slapped me across the face and forcefully whispered into my ear things have changed on faedrun it has become a place of death you wont be able to find out what happened if you are dead the time to search for his fate on faedrun has passed if you have

except in certain cases notable traits has an accent and is very devoted to honor and to contracts relationships travels with the monk kyoshin shi and the priestess lapis rae rumors that when loosed his temper is enough to level mountains bio my story begins in my grandfathers time when the nara pentare were a strong people isolated within our mountains we lived our lives with honor and dignity at least so i am told that all came to an end when nara was attacked by the undead they fought without honor and killed many of us raising them from the dead to join them we might not have survived but so my father said our leaders were wise and had constructed a fleet of ships which carried some of our people away my grandfather and my infant father among them they sailed for quite a time eventually finding land and settling down there we began to rebuild on that land my grandfather died and my father became the head of our house eventually creating me his son and heir my childhood was full of learning about war and about our culture and history rich and full of honor i could have learned the sword but i chose to honor an old tradition of our family and i learned the warhammer instead on faedrun our small but prosperous lands were known for their smiths and small metalwork as a consequence generations of we who ruled honored the smiths by using hammers when i turned twenty my studies and practice were brought to an abrupt end when my father died and i took leadership of our houses establishment on mardrun the next few years were filled with administration and papers but one day an interesting piece of news came to us evidently there were narans on the mainland of mardrun among the colonies this caused a stir and debate began at our highest levels as to what to do about it it was eventually decided that they should be tested to see if they had kept to our ways or if the outlanders had corrupted them with their undesirable influences those corrupted would be cleansed to ensure that the naran people would remain pure and uncorrupted i was selected to accompany the monk kyoshin shi and the priestess lapis rae on their expedition to do so as we arrived we discovered that as was wont to happen the foolish outlanders had gotten involved in a war and mardrun was gripped by chaos this made our task even more difficult but no less vital a failure will not be tolerated to cleanse the naran people is a great and honorable duty and i embrace it no matter what the cost will beplayed by samantha vold name lexia age 17 occupation ranger relationships wilken little brother rauran friend my name is lexia i have a younger brother whom i recently met up with after 5 years of being apart his name is wilken when i was 12 wilken was 11 our parents had begun arguing on and off for several months and mom just couldnt take it anymore so she eventually left she took me with her leaving wilken and dad behind after we left we wandered into a little village about 20 miles south of where we previously had lived there i took the opportunity to ask mom where we were going the only response she gave me was far away honey in reality we never did stray that far from home i think the farthest we ended up was 30 miles south of that first little village we only went a total of 50 miles south all said and done i think she secretly missed dad although she would never admit it to me but we made home in one of the rooms of the tavern after mom befriended the hostess there rent was cheap and life was a bit hard we never really had a lot of money so mom did a lot of hunting to feed us when i was old enough i began working in the tavern as a server and helped the guests that came all the money i made went directly to our rent though i never saw any of it myself but it made mom happy so i guess i was happy during my free time mom would teach me and she occasionally took me out hunting with her i learned archery during those trips and even killed a few meals myself but one day our hunting trip went wrong we were deep in the forest tracking a deer that had previously wandered through we stopped to examine some tracks when i heard a rustling in the bushes i asked mom what it was and she replied saying it was just another animal passing through we held still for a few moments to see if we could hear anything more or if the animal would come out when nothing happened we started moving again that was when it happened we were ambushed by four mordok the skirmish was a bit of a blur to me mom told me to climb the nearest tree that i could find and get up high while she fought them off she took one out with her bow and decapitated another with her sword i sniped one from my position in the tree but there was still one left mom had been wounded while she was fighting and was running out of energy to keep it up the last mordok grappled her to the ground and began to tear her apart i screamed for her and shot an arrow through the mordoks arm that didnt do much simply slowed him down a bit i jumped from my spot in the tree and stuck another arrow in his arm that time i got his attention he left my mom lying on the ground and turned on me when he charged i took aim and stuck my last arrow right through his chest he ran another few feet towards me and then dropped i stayed where i was for a few tense moments just to be sure then sprinted to my moms side she was still breathing when i reached her but was losing a lot of blood from a large wound in her side she looked at me with tears in her eyes and said theres nothing you can do to help me dear but please try to find your father and brother apologize to your father and tell him ive still loved him over these years and take care of your brother he needs you now i promised her i would follow through with her request and stayed by her side while she took her last breath when she had gone i closed her eyes and ran into town as fast as i could the woman who ran the tavern gathered a group of men to help me carry my mother back to town the next day we had a small funeral for her and buried her in the towns graveyard along with her bow and the few arrows we could find i kept her sword for myself and vowed to avenge her death one day and to help protect others from the mordok as best i could so no else had to go through what i had a few weeks later i met rauran he had come into the tavern sat in a corner and challenged anyone that would play to a game even with his seemingly arrogant attitude he kept losing one gentleman stayed and played several rounds with rauran and kept winning eventually rauran got so far into debt that he couldnt pay up anymore and there was no hope of doing so soon a fight then broke out several people helped me break the fight up and i threw both rauran and the other gentleman out a few days later rauran returned sneaking back into the tavern i spotted him sulking in the same corner he had been in the night before but this time he had no game going as courtesy dictates i went over and asked him if i could get him anything he told me he didnt have any money to pay me with but he looked hungry to me i gave him a bowl of stew and walked away when i returned the bowl was empty and he looked slightly guilty i picked up the bowl and heard a muttered thank you as i walked away when i reached the bar and turned around he had gone later that week i ran a few errands for the tavern hostess when i left the market i found rauran huddled in an alleyway i walked over to him and told him id pay him a few pieces of silver to carry my bags for me he accepted and helped me back to the tavern upon returning i offered him another bowl of stew and before i got an answer went to grab a bowl we sat down a table and i learned his story he had been an orphan for about two years and had a bad streak of gambling and fighting he made his way from town to town village to village in hopes of finding some new people to gamble with and hope no one knew of the debts he had built up over the time he spent in each town he explained that gambling was the only way he could earn any money for himself although he wasnt very good at it and kept losing more than he earned and then he ended up in this tavern several days ago plans were kind of in the works for him to leave town and head out to another within the next day or so hearing his story i took pity on him and left to talk to the hostess she offered him a job working in the tavern and a room as well the work would pay off the rent and he would receive one free meal a day that was enough to keep him in town for a while longer several months passed rauran stayed in the village and continued working at the tavern his gambling streak had lessened dramatically although he still played a few games every nowandthen all was going well as we became good friends and my sorrow over my mothers death lessened travelers came in and out and many stories passed through as well rumors of mordok on the move would send search parties out into the forest and theyd return sometimes with a trophy and other times not several mordok head were displayed around the tavern as the one who killed it would triumphantly tell his story to all who would listen one day a lone and young traveler came into the tavern when he pulled the hood of his cloak down i recognized him instantly it may have been five years since i had seen him but it certainly was him my little brother wilken had somehow made his way to the tiny village i dropped the dishes i was carrying in disbelief and ran to him hugging him and rambling about how much i missed him im pretty sure tears sprang into my eyes i was that excited and overjoyed to see him butwhere was father why was he alone i ran to the back and grabbed little brother a bowl of stew sat him down and made him tell me everything that had happened over the five years since i had seen him father had taught little brother everything he knew how to fight gamble a bit hunt read etc they spent many days out in the forest tracking animals and training one day though that little escapade turned disastrous a few weeks ago they had been out in a meadow and father was teaching little brother some new swordfighting techniques but they were ambushed by some mordok that had been attracted to the sounds of a small skirmish father and wilken fought them off as best they could but father ended up mortally wounded wilken was able to take down the last mordok that father had wounded and after that ran to tend to his wounds he was able to get father back to the cabin in which they had been living and did his best to help father heal but the wound became infected and father fell deathly ill after several days of fighting a horrendous fever father passed away leaving little brother on his own he buried father near the cabin took up his sword and headed out looking for any and all mordok he could find in his scheme of revenge little brother spent quite a while wandering from little village to little village he first headed east of where the cabin was and stayed a few nights in a tavern there eventually he made a giant loop and ended up in the village where i was after his story i filled him in on what had happened with mother and me i told him we were now officially orphans knowing that father was dead and i offered to let him stay with me then at least until he was old enough to set out on his own completely but he argued he had heard rumors of a caravan that was headed to davens reach that had gone missing he wanted to check it out so thats where he was headed he was just passing through this little village on his way not wanting to let him go right away i made him stay a week with me and fill me in some on this rumor and everything else that had been going on he met rauran and they seemed to get along well a friendship had begun to form but eventually i had to let him go he set out for davens reach but i had to stay behind so i let him leave with a promise that hed do his best to stay safe and in return i gave him a promise that id join him in davens reach sometime soon i couldnt leave right away but after i had just found my brother after five years of not seeing him i wasnt about to let him go so i made the promise that id meet him in davens reach so thats where it kind of all started i invited rauran to go with me and we set out from the little village and made our way to davens reachcharacter knud saavesen aaker player nathan lloyd knud had ten years when his small fishing village was raided he and his elder brother of five years were on their way back home when they saw the smoke they both knew it would be bad when they got to shore and each were holding the two weapons available in their small boat a sharp knife to clean the fish and a long hook to help pull in nets they were separated in the chaos of the raid but both knew their way home his brother being more developed by his comparatively advanced years was already hunched over the bloodied corpse of his mother sobbing when knud finished his sprint when he finally looked up and saw knud through his sorrow that sorrow turned to fear and then that fear turned to rage knud was still in shock when his older brother ran screaming into the chaos hook extended from one hand and his knife readied in the other he doesnt remember how long he wailed over his dead mother before he realized where his brother had gone what stands out in his mind even to this day was the chill that ran down his spine when his own rage took him into the fray he wasnt as strong as the men fighting with shields and axes but knud was quick to duck through the melee hooking the occasional shield so that his clansmans axe could land true through the screams and the bloodshed he eventually found his brother enthralled in combat at his side was a large viking who treated him all the respect due a fellow warrior throughout the melee the large man blocked or countered dozens of blows that would have otherwise split knuds brother in two as the battle turned for the worse the large man tried to get knuds brother to see reason and retreat but he continued to get more and more reckless in his maneuvers and eventually even the seasoned veteran could not save the boy with an axe to the chest knuds brother fell and knud was left orphaned the large viking grabbed knud by the waist and retreated while knud sobbed that was the last knud saw of his home the viking introduced himself as ivar and knud asked if he could stay on with ivars crew it has been ten more seasons since this story began and knud does not see it ending anytime soonplayed by antonio archie gender male class rogue age 23 race human naran

traits im short feisty and adorable when i was a little girl my family and i came over on a big boat i was about 4 at the time so i dont remember much honestly i only remember people being sick all the time it could have been either from the swaying of the boat or the food that didnt always seem to taste quite righteither way there was a lot of sickness after we got off the boat we found a place to settle down and made a town with some of the other families we met on the boat for the first few years after that every day was hard work getting chores and other things done in order for the village we created to run smoothly soon though we began to thrive there was a good mixture of healers and warriors in our village along with some magi and others with different skills needed for a village to survive some of the adults with more desirable or necessary skills taught the children their trades so their skills and knowledge could be passed on for generations to come every child was required to learn at least one trade since my mother and father were both teachers of their trades i wanted to follow in their footsteps mother taught me how to heal people until i was old enough to train with my father and brothers once i was old enough father made me practice swordplay every day even when i didnt want to its not that i didnt enjoy practicing my swordsmanship it was just that father was a strict teacher once i started sword training i wasnt allowed to practice healing at allunless my father and brothers went out hunting this unfortunately didnt happen as often as i would have liked because the teachers in the village didnt go out on hunting parties as often as the other adults in the village their skills as teachers were too valuable to risk them getting harmed on hunting trips my training continued in the same way for many years until eventually i was required to go on hunting parties along with the others when i was 15 i was out with a hunting party but father and my brothers stayed behind we were a long way away from the village when we looked to the sky to figure out how much daylight we had left there was smoke in the sky after a quick check against the sun and what faint stars we could see we realized the smoke was coming from the direction of our village as one we started to run as we neared the village we could hear people screaming and see the flickering light of flames licking the sky when the hunting party and i finally arrive nothing was left the houses were burned to ruins the villagers were dead and as we stood there looking at all of the destruction ashes from the sky fell down and coated everything in a thick layer of gray the eight of us that were left mourned for the rest of the day the days that followed we stayed long enough to gather anything salvageable say our goodbyes and bury our dead we set out together to find a new home eventually some of us drifted off in search of revenge against the ones who destroyed our village and our lives others stayed in settlements we found along the way i have given up trying to find those who destroyed my village instead im fighting so no one will ever go through

precise and why are we detailing this mans past everyone has a pasta story to them so they do and we will ignore the fact that you neglected to answer my question for now the night which it all ultimately began was no different from any other he was who is he he has a name we know he must have a name ah yes his namethe mans name was kalt kalt dthidranki and he had been moving from city to town to settlement for as long and he could remember taking what he needed or wanted as he pleased so he was a thief among other things yes and this title is quite relevant to his story it all began due to kalts larcenous habits on this night he was walking with a pair of well armed men thats not it we saw this part he was running and they were chasing oh yes you are quite right he was running from the town guard after a mugging a man in the street for his coin purse now normally kalt would have familiarized himself more with a new town before committing any acts of burglary but this mark was too easy to pass up and his greed got the better of him you see so kalt was running through unfamiliar streets with guards closing in on him kalt is at this point incredibly aware of his impending incarceration but he continues running and turns a corner where he sees a caravan wagon with a man standing by it but all of this is not the interesting part what we found intriguing is what happening next when the guards turned the corner and saw they man at the caravan wagon and they asked him which way the thief went the guards again asked if he had seen a man running by here and which way he went the wagon man again you leave out names ah yes the wagon man is called ivar each time the guards asked ivar which way kalt had gone ivar told them he had no idea what they were talking about after ivar denied any knowledge of kalts whereabouts kalt heard two swords being drawn then the sound of two swords clattering to the dirt then the sound of two men in armor collapsing kalt started to move out the other side of the wagon but he stopped and looked around at the scene with ivar curiosity getting the better of him this time you see and looking at what had befallen ivar his ears certainly had not deceived him two others stood over the unconscious guards ivar then turned to kalt and said i could use a man like you and they rest as they say is history kalt has been traveling

sorry for the poor bastards launch the burning oil the commander ordered flaming pots flew over the ramparts and landed with deadly efficiency people screamed out in pain undead flailed as they burned our archers let loose volleys of arrows upon their clustered formations men would fall over screaming with arrows sticking out of their arms and faces but they just kept coming i heard the banging of a ram at the gate house the constant rhythmic pounding 1 2 3 boom 1 2 3 bang 1 2 3 thump over and over again they would only stop when we poured oil or alcohol on them and burned their pitiful siege it would stop for five to ten minutes then it would start over again but this time it was different this time they brought ladders simple wooden ladders and were attacking on all sides two squads were sent to each wall in order to stave off the attackers boys sent to defend the wall against religious fanatics most of the proper militia died defending the walls so the army commander demanded every

neck he must have been in his late 60s i thought to myself then i heard it the smack of wood on stone the ladders touched the walls scorpio bolts shot out from the tops of the guards towers picking men off the ladder but they reloaded too slowly and there were too many ladders for it to be of much use we wont let these fuckers take this wall men isnt that right men our corporal commanded the squad replied back right the first bastard made it near the top of the ladder when three spears were thrust into his chest the dead man fell over and was replaced by another eventually they pushed past the first line men and women began to scream as they hacked and slashed their way past our febrile lines somehow we manage to push them back men cheered the squad roared out in triumph piles of bodies laid at the bottom of the ladder i looked around the top of the wall trying to find john he laid against the wall with his intestines spilling out from a massive gash across his gut i scrambled to his side no john i cried out go on without me jim im not going to let your intestines spill out any more john tears streamed down my bloody face as johns body slowly went limp and his eyes glazed over i tried to stuff his intestines back in while screaming youll be all right over and over i stopped looking at the blood and green bile on my hands a hand was placed on my shoulder and i turned to look at the person whom tried to comfort me my corporals bloody eye sockets and rotating face stared at me blankly i awoke from my dream with wide crusted eyes i then reached across my bed and grabbed the bottle of mead on the night stand popped off the cork and drank what remained of the bottle stretching i stood up a cold winter breeze blew in from under the door i slipped into my work clothes and walked my way to the bar a kilt with a blue ribbon flew in the breeze i sat near the fireplace to warm up only two people sat at the counter one had a pegleg and the other sat down trying to nurse off a hangover with a glass of fruity yellow wine and a pretzel i took a piece of gold wood out of my pocket and threw it at the barkeep he picked it up off the ground and asked me what i wanted to drink and eat i shrugged and kept looking into the fire slowly the screams crept back into my head i remembered the wails of pain as burning oil covered their bodies and burned them to cinder the barkeep sat a bottle of some yellow fruity drink on the table and a steaming hot pretzel roll next to the bottle i popped of the cork it was fruity a little sour but all and all good the roll was filled with smoky bacon eggs and cheese the barkeep placed five silver on the table and took a seat next to me smiling youve been coming here for the last two months now youve come in here sat quietly eaten your meal and have taken a bottle and in those two months i havent even asked your name the barkeep said inquisitively its none of your business i said bluntly youre right i just wanted to know if you wanted a job thats all it pays well 2 silver a day and a free meal but no free drinks i know youll make more working for me than working for the lumber mill across the road the man said nonchalantly i shrugged and sighed might as well what do you want me to do cook and clean up messes that are made and if needed to act as a strong arm if shit goes down the man said smiling ok we both shook each others hand for the next two months everything was easy the people were friendly and the work was easy the barkeep was a good employer a former warden of crows landing he was an ok guy one day ivan asked me to go with him on a trip to new hope to buy some new type of liquor we gathered what supplies we thought were needed money food bed roles weapons and armor the trip was easy no mordok and no bandits thank the gods new hope had grown quite a bit since i was last here ivan lead me to this little brewery where he bought three kegs from the owner after that we both decided to get ourselves real food and a drink four men dressed in new hope guard uniforms sat in a small bar we sat at a table across from the guards men a young syndar server came up to us happily and asked us what we wanted to drink i asked for bourbon and ivan asked for a glass of mead one of the guardsmen stood up from his seat and stumbled over to us you boys look lost we ignored him what are your ears full of cotton you dumb fucks the guardsmen sounded agitated the other three men stood up and began to walk over ivan spoke up were from crows landing getting supplies and we were thirsty the leader of the group leaned in and smiled well this is a private party and youre not invited the waitress stood off to the side with two cups i shouted for her to make the order to go the barkeep asked one of the guards men to stop harassing his customers the guardsmen flipped him off the woman squeezed passed me on the right and gave me two bottles one of the men reached out and grabbed a bottle out of my hand the man smiled thank you for your generosity you crow hicks can get out now me and ivan stood up and began to walk out when one of the men pinned our waitress against a wall by her throat the barkeep yelled at the man to stop two of them jumped over the bar counter and began to kick the shit out of the barkeep the man that pinned the woman to the wall dropped his pants and pulled up the womans dress squeal for me hon it makes it more fun the leader of the group said sickeningly i looked to ivan and we stepped forward the man meant to be on lookout was too busy watching his buddy trying to rape the waitress ivan walked to the bar and slid over the counter i looked at the clay bottle in my hand it was made of clay and was thick an old trick to make people think they were getting more out of their bottle i swung the bottle in an upwards arc slamming it into the back of the lookouts head he stumbled over i clocked him the temple when he turned to look at me ivan had

bat away the foes there he found power to drive his foes back with the strength of his arms from there he focused on building his body and yearned for more power during this time the village held

enough capital to travel across mardrun practicing my trade and learning what i could about the undead from those few who fought them in faedrun and lived to tell their tales i toured with caravans

was a warship built for coastal duels raids and maneuverability in treacherous waters not lengthy expeditions days into the voyage the ship hit a fierce storm the crew battled to keep the ship above

lunara controls the tides the shaken syndar listened on intently great were pawns in a marital dispute the joke didnt raise morale as much as he hoped after hours of battling the storm they finally escaped but the ship tailing his was lost in the aftermath the phoenix finally change the vessels formally crass name to the one it is known by today blown off course supplies began to dwindle it was only on empty stomachs that the crew admitted that the ballistae they had sacrificed precious cargo space to carry were actually intended to fend off coastal pirates at last after many more hardships after weeks of starvation sickness and suicide they at last found land it would come to be known as the fire isles a village was built and isaac halragoth spent some time enjoying comfort and the

other supplies this town was coveted by all in the local are as many of the traders came back and forth between the villages soon many of these traders kept coming to see father trying to get more and more of his stores silver was not the problem there was just no food to buy soon father started to turn them away at first they left without question but as time went on things became more and more desperate the conversations started with begging and then after a while turned to anger and threats she was scared she wished they would all leave her family alone go to a place where everyone has food she wanted to give them food she didnt understand why they could not share with the strangers one night her father sat her down to quell her protests in mid conversation there was a noise and then an eerie silence her fathers face blanked with fear he knew what was happening quiet girl hide in the crawlspace take these furs bundle well never make a noise and dont come out till i come and get you no matter what her father commanded she scurried quickly into the crawlspace huddling in the small dark corner of the underside of her home noises crashing and screaming that was her mothers voice that was her fathers and many other screams she did not know their owner the traders who left angry had been captured by a large group of bandits seeking food and supplies to keep them alive to save their lives they gave the bandits information about a large store of food in the end signing the death warrant of her family and the rest of the village hours and hours of noise and fear she didnt freeze the house above her was a blazing inferno keeping her warm and awake to hear the villages final screams die into the night as the fear set in and the reality of the situation was finally understood when she realized she was truly alone stress and emotion took her racking her body with sadness passing out slowly to the sounds of death and destruction a short time later the next day perhaps the cold set in listening to her father she did not move he did not come to get her somewhere inside she was hoping he was still alive she knew better she just didnt want to believe it the chill of winter spread slowly over her body the sounds of her stomach were the only thing letting her know that the time frame she had been hiding here was longer than it should have been somewhere inside she decided she did not want to be alone in this world she was ok with just passing on to the next life the cold was the only thing that she felt the numbness caressed her body like a loving parent taking her to bed she was so scared and now as things calmed she just wanted to sleep just sleep forever as her eyes went to close for the last time there was a noise distant at first but getting closer she became aware of many footsteps and a dog scratching and panting and sniffing through the rubble of what was once her home above her she tried to make a noise but she was too weak she could barely breathe let alone move and then it happened that warm breath the cold nose and then all the licking the last she remembered was this prickly beard and being lifted from her soon to be

charlie corcoran character name isa class rogue race human background my name is isa and i was born in the year 234 from birth i was to be cursed with a life of hardship grief and being thrown aside as an outcast i was born in the maykar dominion where my mother used to tell me stories about an independent and proud people who would have known that these stories would make me the person i am today from what i remember my mother was a beautiful woman with a passion for nature and the riches it could provide she operated a small alchemist store where she spent most of her time creating potions for the aldorian armies when she had any free time she would try to spend the most of it with me i know nothing of my father and nor do i care to ever find out i spent my life growing up in the kingdom of aldoria i was too young to remember the undead turning my people to darkness but i was reminded daily by those i grew up around we were the lucky ones that just happened to be on a caravan delivering unique ingredients in exchange for medical supplies to aldoria when our kingdom fell to the undead there were twelve of us on the journey though only my mother and i did not return to our home growing up was an everyday battle from being called a traitor for what my people did to just getting my ass kicked i had to learn early how to fight just so the other kids knew that if they tried anything i wasnt going to make it easy my mother raised me alone and i helped around the shop picking up the skills that i would need later in life life went on like this until the day my life was again turned upside down i was eighteen when the cheers echoed through our small village about the defeat of the maykar everyone was overjoyed and one could have thought there was a festival being held we could over hear people walking by our dilapidated house saying well there are still two that havent been butchered yet and we knew we wouldnt be able to stay here much longer my ailing mother wouldnt make it on a long journey and anyway where would we go two months later my mother passed and i was left to fend for myself until a chance encounter would change my life forever it was a night of terrible storms where one could get lost going from one end of the village to the other when a knock came to my door normally only people collecting money would knock but maybe someone finally had the balls to come to try an make this my final night as i opened the door i saw 3 large men wearing armor like i had never seen before what was the only word i could think to say knowing i probably wouldnt live to say another he almost chuckled at me and turned around to show me 2 wounded men who would not make it without healing with no more healers around due to the war i was his only chance i stared at him and said i will save them but you must let me join you and get me out of these lands i didnt care who they were or what they were doing i just knew that i didnt want to wait for death may it be by the people around me or the fast approaching undead over the next few years we did what was necessary to survive the day we heard that aldoria had fallen was the happiest day of my life everyone else was talking about how this was the end of days and how we are doomed to the undead i was probably the only person thinking about throwing my own little festival we made the decision to take what money we could get our hands on and help us secure passage to this proclaimed new world i say whatever is to become of our future it will be better than what has happened in the past no

unknown madman jack jr grew up listing to his fathers mad stories of walking corpses and evil scripts but resented his father every day in his youth feeling that his father was a weak crazy old man that just couldnt live with the idea of life life went on as normal as day by day jack sr would train jack jr to his craft of scouting yet the crazy rantings and solo talk sessions of his father would drive him to the point of neglect towards his father one day a letter would come requesting jack srs assistance in exploring a new land dubbed mardrun jack sr would kiss his wife goodbye and wish his son luck with his life claiming that what he was doing would be important when the day came that the undead would over run faedrun this angered jack jr feeling his father was truly mad to give in to his false fears and that abandoning his wife and child was a cowards move jack jr would start to run with the wrong crowd that would lead to jack jr using what his father had taught him to become an assassin caring little for the lives of others was easy for jack and would make him a great assassin with his skills jack would gain a reputation among the assassin community and gain the name jack black for his heart was just that black upon receiving a job up to the north one day jack would enter a town that was filled with disease and plague and use this to advantage for his kill he would merely poison that mans food and watch him die jack sat and watched as the man would consume the food in his sickened and famine state in order to live only this food would lead to his death the man would twist and squirm as his insides slowly died and eventually gave out jack had done it the man was dead yes yes i have done it he thought as the man slowly arose from the wooden floor of his kitchen how could this be jack thought he was dead or wasnt he and then jack saw the undead corpse his father spoke so much of slowly arise and look back sensing jacks presence jack would run and run for his life making it back home only to find that his mother was dead and the town over taken jack traveled for years avoiding the plague till he would find a town that was still yet left standing there jack settled and began to study and learn of the undead and there plight in order to stop them one night in his sleep jack was awoken by a dark shadowy presence that told him that he would help jack learn of the undead and ways of defeating them if he wished but he would have to devote himself to all that his order would teach jack jack accepted and was later inducted into what would be called the order of the black knight society the order of the black knight society was one that considered themselves protectors of the people of faedrun in which devoted practice and study of the necromantic arts would be used to understand and defeat the undead plague however this practice was one that was shunned and looked down upon by many humans and for that reason its followers would follow the same fate jack abandoning all he knew of the assassin way took on the study necromancy in order to get his revenge on the undead plague he would also abandon his old name and dub himself helgin black in memory of his mother but not enough time would be given in order to stop the undead plague and in time would be forced to flee in order to study his way elsewhere helgin would dawn the appearance of the penitent by marking his face for life and brand himself a traitor for all time to helgin this way his only means to sneak through their forces and gain passage to the new land helgin

out to anyone who would have me my first master was a torchmaker i spent two years coated in pitch before running away my next master owned a livery but in finding me ill suited for the animals he sold my services to alfedro the locksmith being alfedros apprentice amounted to being a slave he fed me well enough and the lodging was better than my previous accommodations of tar and straw but no bed or bread could make up for alfedros cruelty i scrubbed and cooked and cleaned and farmed but only rarely was tasked with oiling a mechanism or grinding a new key alfedro had few books and all of them dedicated to his trade i was a poor reader but i studied the drawings and diagrams of the locks at every opportunity patiently waiting the day i would escape his yoke the day came when afeldro was called by a wealthy nobleman to install a new safe alfedro was so flustered by the late arrival of the movers that he forgot to lock me in i left with everything i could carry and a spare set of master keyspausing only to grind a key to the safe alfedro was now installing that day i whisked away into the slums never to look back i made quite a splash in the thieves guild and was able to keep a roof and bread by selling spare keys and information on where they could be used i bought my time and saved up to put together my own crewthough i had sold many of my stolen keys i had always kept one special key for myself the noblemans safe key this prize was mine i gave no regard to the method of our robberywe simply barged in during the night and stormed to our prize the silver and gems amounted to quite the hoardwith more than enough spare to buy a cart and a few horses swift enough to get us to the border lands of aldoria only a days travel from the border we began to have trouble

donkey and made my way to a ship and to mardrunname harkov played by cole potter age ask race human class cleric harkov was three when his family made their way across the sea from faedrun to mardrun their family barely scraped their way onto one of the boats it cost them most of his parents combined wealth and a few favors from his fathers time in the vandregonian army his father is a tradesman and his mother a healer they lived a modest but comfortable living for the first eighteen years of his life on mardrun when harkov was thirteen his parents divorced his family was the near perfect family before that it wasnt entirely shocking to harkov though his brother didnt handle their parents divorce well he was emotional and it was clear why harkov on the other hand was different on the outside he in what was simple to him rationalized that his parents were free people and had the right to make their own choices they had raised him to be independant and he knew he wouldnt lose contact with either of his parents so he showed no worry on the inside he didnt feel anything he didnt care harkov was too busy focusing on himself to let his parents lives and actions affect him harkov received a good education from a fairly large school in newhope he was a good student but found himself tiring of the everyday studies and repetition of life in the colony more so than his peers by all expectations harkov was a normal boy and shouldve fit in well with his peers during his days of schooling the opposite was true harkov always felt distanced from his peers sure he had friends but only when he was at his school in everything he did harkov felt like he was treated as if he was something less than human no matter what he tried harkov was always an outsider it didnt matter how much he wanted to be accepted harkovs isolation drew him to the stories of glory so many young men find themselves encaptured in he often planned his future around following his fathers footsteps and joining the ranks of the new vandregonian army funny considering he had never been in a real fight his martial prowess was hardly doubted though seeing as his often aggressive demeanor and determination in athletics gave a glance into his abilities because of his peers harkov grew bitter and antisocial fearing having to deal with people while still wanting to be accepted he slowly disconnected from the few friends he had and fell into what could only be described as darkness his attitude changing from one of eagerness and childish joy to hatred and cynicism harkov was lifted from his darkness when he became friends with a girl when he was fifteen harkov had known of her but she had never really knew he existed so they hadnt interacted before they began being placed in lessons together they had similar opinions on many things and his cynical tendencies were often found humourous their friendship blossomed quickly she pulled him from his selfcentered existence eventually his feelings turned from simple friendship to more some could say he loved her but the idea wouldnt be put to the test for a long while as she was interested in other suitors for years harkov continued on like he had spiraling in and out of his own dark place as harkov grew older though he slowly gained more confidence as he grew stronger he used his strength as a source of hope it was often fleeting at best harkov was never the fastest or the strongest but he thought that any improvement from the boy he was was an achievement as he reached his eighteenth year a small group of his peers went on what could be called a tour of several human settlements and colonies outside of newhope in an attempt to begin giving the next generation some experience of their new world harkov went and so did the subject of his affections the two were inseparable their peers questioned whether or not the two were lovers and to the strangers they came across in their journey almost certainly thought they were however no matter how far things escalated between the two it didnt change anything and when they returned home to newhope they remained as they had for years only now harkov new the greatest pain from heartbreak he had ever felt however while on their tour the group stopped in starkhaven and harkov stole away to explore and while he marvelled at the mighty keep and surrounding settlement of what was supposedly a new chapter of the famous order of arnath he encountered a man named brother ventaris harkov was amazed by the man he was everything he had heard from the stories of the lions clad in full plate with a large tower shield and a hammer both bearing the image of a rampant lion upon them harkov approached the lion with an enthusiasm he hadnt felt in years to the lion he mustve seemed like a child rather than a young man brother ventaris greeted harkovs enthusiasm and questions with a surprising amount of what could be described as welcoming briefly explaining the basic tenants of arnaths path from what he gleaned from brother ventaris explanation appealed to harkov far more so than the teachings of the light as he was taught when he was younger brother ventaris must have appreciated harkovs eagerness or sensed something in the young man he himself could not for he invited the boy to come participate in some training being conducted shortly harkovs admiration for the man was prevalent and harkov happily accepted the invitation hoping to prove himself it was little more than basic physical training with a small group of initiates but in harkovs mind it was grand and exciting returning to his group after giving his thanks to his new found friends for their inclusion of him harkov had what he saw as a fantastic life experience after his return to newhope harkov began to grow stagnant his wondrous journey mired by his heartache and disappointment at life after his schooling was over his life devoid of purpose he worked as a laborer to begin his life as a young man but this wasnt enough for him his original path of the army seemed pointless after the once prominent colors of red and gray fell into simple subsistence then on a stormy night as thunder and lightning boomed and crackled outside his window harkov remembered his admiration for the men and women of the order and found renewed purpose in the idea of becoming one of them the weeks after that were filled with preparation for his journey before gathering supplies he reached out to his acquaintance brother ventaris and inquired as to whether or not he should join harkov received an encouraging letter from a griffin named brother oliver shortly after stating that the order was always looking for aspiring individuals harkov needing no further affirmations left for starkhaven a few days later upon arriving he was thrown into a training class with the lay militia and learned the basics of proper combat making swift friends with a man named basil who helped train the militia harkov took to the study of battle quickly and his true martial prowess was realized at an astonishing rate throught his training harkov would notice brother ventaris conversing with basil and other members of the order of arnaths light whilst observing his class training harkov simply took it as the leadership attempting to draw the best from their men by being an active presence he was mistaken though for a few weeks after harkov had begun his training he was approached by brother ventaris and a stranger who turned out to be brother oliver the two informed harkov that they sensed a potential in him to be not just a regular soldier but an ordained cleric of arnath harkov was shocked never having felt a strong connection to any faith he thought he simply did not have the potential to harness the powers of the divine his role models convinced him otherwise and encouraged him to seek out the path of arnath and to reach his full potential a few days later harkov was accepted as an initiate into the ecclesiastical order harkov now trains under the diligent eyes of the senior members of the order of arnaths light hoping to bring honor to himself and his order a very wavering personality harkov is often caught between ebbs and flows of happiness and anger at times skeptical at other times friendly harkov is an easy individual to read and seems to still carry a slight naivety about him while at the same time a wisdom beyond his years truly a man of contradictions he is devout in his faith pursuit of honor and his higher calling and will stubbornly protect what he cares about with little or no care for his own well beingplayer name jared helgestad character name haralt von khnwolff gender male age 25 race human hair brown eyes greyish blue occupation

never stopped being told who did this or that who killed what or who and how how gory or gruesome the kills great friends dying or great enemies so many little stories of tragedies and of victory the best tale i can remember is of the command outpost and the brave who fell there they killed many and lost some but the glory is all that remains glory and great legends bolder and bolder the tales became first the stories were that of a scuffle that led to them winning then on to a complete raid that they won then it turned into them fighting off wave after wave of brutal warriors eventually

years back was for the most part untouched by the undead in faedrun it was a small trade town with many travelers and many stories at the age of twelve a small band of undead and penitent found the village and attacked it with expert leadership of both of gandrs parents the town was saved with only three lives lost in the process the village had many injuries but frea was able to mend all the wounds of those not outright killed and save them all unbeknownst to her she had a small bite from one of the undead on her ankle with much healing skill she went to work on herself once she noticed the bite but at that point it was already too late her magic and knowledge of the human body was not enough to save her and she died now without a mother gandrs father sent him to a monastery for protection and to learn while he would try to cleanse the land of this undead plague with an unholy vengeance his father went off and did in fact make a name for himself in many of the conflicts he was a part of at the monastery gandr was a young boy and for the most part an orphan although that was not uncommon in this monastery he spent all of his time trying to learn anything he could about healing so that he could save someones life if it ever came to that again his mothers death was not a peaceful one and he would not wish it even on his own worst enemies the monks of the monastery took a liking to gandr and while the other children would be out playing or doing chores they would take turns answering his questions which were mostly about the human body and how to heal it after seven years the monks allowed gandr to join their order to help protect people on his initiation day gandrs father showed up before the ceremony and warned him that they needed to leave and they needed to leave now it was the only way he would have time to save his sons life when asked why his father explained that a vast army of penitent and undead was on its way to destroy this monastery for the hope it was bringing to the region after refusing to go with his father without at least trying to save the monastery his father knocked gandr unconscious and black bagged him three hours later gandr woke and was promptly informed by his father that while he left word with the monastery on what was happening he didnt believe that they would all be dead in the next few hours hatred and heated words flew between them about how gandr was a man now and his father had no right to make decisions for him with the retort that gandr knew nothing of the real world and was no man yet despite his age knowing that this fight was futile gandr suppressed it to be had at another time on the travels away from the now fallen monastery he and his father talked about anything that they could so as not to bring up arguments in this alf taught gandr everything he knew about magic now on a practical sense gandr learned everything his father had to say he even wrote it down in books to remember for later as a reference he never developed the ability to store mana in himself from his fathers lessons but that was more of a not having time to meditate and try while traveling with his father gandr heard many rumors about his father heroic exploits and such after traveling with him for a few months gandr finally asked where they were going and was answered with anywhere to keep the last light of frea safe with many miles many towns many talks and many lessons in knowledge and the world both gandr and alf were not able to find a spot that was not now infested with undead or penitent in one way or another like all seasons all times must change after three years with his father and much running there was finally an event they could not run from being caught in a town where there seemed no escape so his father created a diversion to allow his son to escape gandrs father told him the way to the next town and that after escaping if he could make it there he should be safe on the way to the next own more attacks happened and gandr lost his way lost in the forest and trying to find the town his father sent him from while on his travels one night he was trying to make a fire and a man ran into him and his little camp ruined the fire and yelled at him run or die we ran thru the night and when we finally reached the day and felt safe enough we finally introduced ourselves properly guthrum was his name he told gandr about a port that was heading to a new promised land together they traveled and grew a friendship they reached the docks of a town and used the money from guthrum

history june 24th 267 the flames that had consumed brother fredricks body were now little more than small embers glowing in the early morning light dew had formed in areas not scorched by the previous nights fire and a light fog hung in the mornings june air what little brother fredrick could feel of the soft breeze caressing his blackened body was sheer pain torturing his raw newly exposed skin and nerves he might have been thankful that most of his body was unfeeling as he drifted in and out of consciousness laying trapped under fallen beams brother fredrick slipped into memory he had been excited nervous but he was prepared weeks of study and practice had gone into readying himself for that fateful summit proud that he had been given this diplomatic mission he stood tall as brother oliver walked to the table he almost felt bad for the man he was a good servant of arnath he just happened to have succumbed to corrupting influences and thats why he why the chapter of the fist were there to once again make the difficult decision bare the pain that others could not so that light could find its way in the world brother fredrick was not surprised when he was informed of the fists decision to march on starkhaven a corruption of the soul had slowly crept in through the chapter of the light who stood poised to take control of the order they had become false guides and had blinded the eyes of their leader alexandros makedon the hand of arnath he needed to be free of their influence of that brother fredrick was certain as it had throughout the night pain brought brother fredricks mind back into the present he tried shifting his weight under the large oaken slab only to feel an immediate surge of hot pain shoot down his left arm he knew his left hand had been crushed little energy left he slowly felt down his side with his right hand to itch at an angry red piece of flesh the fire had long ago reduced his clothing to ash and he now lay naked to fate slipping into unconsciousness once again brother fredrick felt similarly exposed when initial dialogs had stalled at the table and the talks spilled into the streets in what had rapidly turned into a very public debate lay order sergeant basil gavras had taken the reins from the more softspoken brother oliver and used his commanding presence to turn the favor of the crowd to the chapter of lights side brother fredrick had not prepared for such public debate and was shakily holding ground he knew his arguments to be true but could do little to combat basils loud twisting of the truth anger began to cloud his groomed demeanor that anger had only grown as brother fredrick lay helpless it had not been washed away by tears of pain nor wished away on prayers for relief it had not dissolved when hopelessness began its insidious creep into his thoughts or when exhaustion took hold his anger burned right on through the night becoming ever more violent lashing out at circumstance and suspects to his dying he screamed with and at that anger as if to mock his efforts only dry coughing left his burned throat before he collapsed into nothingness at the top of his lungs brother fredrick yelled to the hand to stop the fighting that had broken out between the two chapters he yelled at the fist lions standing watch he yelled at the chapter master who continued to guard the hand locked in the keep blood was needlessly being spilled and it was on the hands of all present only moments prior had an uneasy calm took hold over starkhaven once both parties left the debate to regroup brother fredrick had assumed they would reconvene and continue negotiations he was shocked when reports reached him that fighting had started attempting to dislodge the fist he knew it would not work the fist was too well prepared and entrenched to be pried out without massive loss of life on both sides it was this knowledge that caused him to run to the keep it was this knowledge that caused him to yell to anyone in power to stop and it was what caused him to ignore the fire quickly spreading throughout the keep he awoke to shouts for help quickly the large beam that pinned him was lifted the pain and sensation knocked him out more voices more debris removed he was moving when he awoke next carried on a stretcher a healer walking beside reciting prayers in and out of consciousness again the healer

anything born to the phoenix tribe in the deserts of the maykar dominion he was easily distracted by anything that wasnt sand when the phoenix would stop in any city big or small finnath would almost surely get lost trying to explore anything he could his father was a hunter and trapper his mother passed during childbirth while his father admired finnaths curiosity and excitement he also worried since he knew the dangers of straying too far from the group in the desert or maybe worse in a city while finnath wasnt very attentive to his fathers teachings of trapping and the many ways to skin animals he picked up what he needed to at least make him proud finn was far more interested in hearing stories about lands with great green forests wide blue lakes and strange and different customs he especially loved the stories laertes would tell and would constantly pry for more details about these far off places when he was 19 the decision to follow magis yara was made and finnath was beyond thrilled to be going on a real adventure sure they had made many treks across the desert before but he always knew that it would lead to just more of the tan and brown expanses now hell actually get to see something new the sea that hes heard so much about his young optimism held strong in the harsh travels through the desert game was scarce and remaining food had to be rationed his father would often give his own food to finn and unthinking finn would graciously eat it after a time his father grew exhausted and ill like many others as reality began to set in the gravity of the situation wore at finns optimism he knew he had to help his father he would plea to the clerics of the group but their energy was also quite tapped the most that could be done was to try to find reagents to concoct tonics that might help him and others who had also been suffering from this ailment in foreign lands with not much hope he decided to try to search for these reagents himself the next time their caravan stopped for the night he snuck out of camp and went on his own scouring the dunes for any of the scarce plants he could find after days of repeating this and making very little progress he knew he would need help anariel was older than him by two years growing up together he knew that he could trust her finn knew that with her desire to help others love of adventure and being his friend that she would be willing to help with anariels camel clementine they were able to cover much more ground after three nights with no success it began to feel dismal his father grew weaker with each day on the fourth night they found a lush oasis plants of all sorts grown around it they collected what they could carry and took it back overjoyed elders put the reagents to good use healing finnaths father along with many others finnath and anariel tried to explain where this oasis was but when the caravan got to that spot nothing remained as if it had all been some sort of mirage while his father still recovered finnath tried to take up his responsibilities he began to wish he had paid more attention to his father before and found himself asking more questions about his trade with each passing day when they had finally made it finns eyes grew wide taking in the sight of the most water hed ever seen in his life he ran to the shore and simply couldnt believe this to be real just as hed been told it was almost the total opposite of the desert it was blue and wet everywhere the phoenix stayed here for some time he had heard it was to find ships and someone willing to captain them he would spend these days exploring this port city watching dock workers bring in boats and fish so many fish hed never seen live fish like this before and was intrigued he attempted to board a fishing vessel once snuck on as they took off it was then that he truly learned what it meant to be seasick while he didnt learn much about fish that day he did learn that he didnt like boats months passed and eventually the day came to board a ship to find their new home finn spent most of that time below deck he was far less helpful on the seas than he had once imagined himself being he found himself wondering if an endless sea was actually worse than a desert and for all the times that they wished they had more water in their travels to get to the sea now he only wished it would go away after storms on the sea and in his stomach they finally land at their new home if he had been excited when he first saw the sea it didnt even compare to what he felt now in his heart he knew that this place was the home he had always dreamt of lush greens and blues of trees and the accent of the sea sand on the beach even felt welcoming for the first time he may have even enjoyed its tan hue and coarseness under his feet the only thing to break his near trance like state of taking in all of these delightful colors is the sounds of his friends and family cheering in excitement that day they built a basic camp and much celebration and praise to solarus fills the air until night the next day and each day after that they find ways to survive and make this new home their own finnath and his father build a small home on the ground as much as finn wanted to live in the trees and be closer to the sky his fathers stamina still was not the greatest and this was much easier for him the days were spent exploring finding new fruits and other foods along with small animals finn loved to watch the rabbits on the island the way they would dart here and there always made him smile he had no qualms to hunting and trapping them but everyone agreed that had to be done in moderation this gave him more than enough opportunities to spend time spectating over the years he learned to truly love providing for his community as much as he loved going out into the forests and traversing new portions of the island seeing the joy that he would bring to the faces of the others brought him something even more days pass like hours and years pass like mere weeks they name their new home fire isle and it goes from surviving to thriving finnath perfects his skills with traps and bows he even lures some groups of live rabbits into a makeshift pen and starts raising them on a fateful day a group of phoenix lead by laertes and anariel head off to see if they can find more land word travels back that they found humans they start to travel back and forth each time coming back with more exciting stories than the last time and with more silver finnath continues his daily life tending to his rabbits and foraging what he can even though it becomes less necessary each day one day after walking one of the same trails that hed walked every 5th day of the week he came to a realization he was bored as a member of the community he feels a responsibility to stay behind over time his father takes notice of finn growing depressed and follows him one day knowing what needs to be done he packs finns things and that night he convinces him to join the expeditions heading north saying that if theres anyone who could help bring color and sunlight to the dirge it would be finnath standing at the shores of fire isle finn wonders if the north will hold the same excitement as those first steps that he took onto the island as he sees the phoenix ship come into view on the horizon he cant tell if his stomach is starting to turn with excitement or the ever so fond memory of seasickness an hour later hed come to realize it was both but still manages to keep a strong and wild smileplayer name

me and my brother came of age we began our travels together to find the nearest vandergon outpost once we left travels me and hector had a difference of opinion from a young age i had a deep hatred for the penitent and their undead masters that have tainted our home so when i came across a group of penitent lead by and undead i demanded we attack them hector refused for he believed in the justification of the penitent and thought to join them this was a betrayal to our family so i slaughtered hector for his betrayal once he was dealt with i pursued the penitent i attempted to tracked them for days till i had lost the trail but my journey had taken me to a ship port were i saw men wearing vandergon colors and tabards boarding a ship filled with joy on finding them i followed them aboard the ship however once i was aboard i was taken by surprise the men i thought were vandergon were actually a group of bandits who were headed for the new world of mardrun they took me as a prisoner to be dealt with once they arrived in mardrun two days past and me and my captors had finally arrived in the new world but it was not a time of celebration i still had the issue of gaining my

terrors every night when i arrived in the colony one of the peasant families was kind enough to take me in this family had absolutely nothing but this only taught me to depend on myself for survival when i finally came of age it became clear that i needed to leave since then i have traveled these lands searching for answers about my real family and from what ive found so far its not necessarily a history to be proud of everywhere i go im always looking for more answers but i will never speak directly of what i learned about where i am from in my journeys i have lived with paupers and thieves gypsies and pirates and even the ulven ive learned my trades from those that i have shared the road with by watching and feverishly asking questions of them i have found some peace in learning everything i can in this world when our paths do eventually split i find that continuing my travels on my own is best for just about everyone there is one woman that has been a part of my adventure for sometime now our paths crossed when i confronted a couple of unsavory fellows that were harassing her just outside of a village after the dispute was settled i found myself taken aback by her aura at the time i decided to travel with her to the next village to ensure her safety but after we went our separate ways i was unable to stop thinking about her i made sure our paths crossed again before she headed out to the next village and offered to protect her along the road again after traveling together like this for awhile i finally expressed my feelings for her luckily the feeling was reciprocated i fight as a last resort and take a life only as a necessity i protect that which i love and will play my part in a group when it suits my needs my honor finds trouble for me but i always

maybe you have a grudge to settle not the first and wont be the last in either case youre buying the brenfang well since you found me you already know my name is erasmus i am the son of an itinerant millwright these days i simply trust in the spirits to put me where i need to be as a child my family traveled between aldoria and vandregon my father taught me how to build watermills windmills and when work was lean how to build adits since you have that confused look on your face you should know that all these structures are crafted from wood so i learned the skills of a carpenter when metal parts were needed i learned how to find bog ore smelt it and to forge the parts needed when i was in my teens my father deemed i was as qualified as any journeyman millwright my fathers name what does that matter he is gone and youre not paying for his name so let the dead rest in peace while i enjoyed the work i wanted to build something more lasting i wanted to build bridges that would last the ages i wanted to lay foundations that could bear greater loads for mills well my father was disappointed that this was the path i wanted to take but he also knew that if he didnt say yes then i would have simply left and learned the ways of the stonemason on my own he said that it was my mother in me making me want to go my own way he gave me his blessings and wished me the best that was also the last time i spoke to him lets see i joined the aldorian stonemasons guild in 245maybe 246 the year really does not matter after six grueling years as an apprentice and journeyman stonemason i was ready to prove myself by taking the masters test i was commissioned by the guild to craft a bridge over the vetluga river while the vetluga wasnt a wide river the river flow was fast moving and it made ferry crossings difficult at that time tavern rumours had been rife with stories of new lands discovered of the walking dead growing ever bolder in their battles and of a king or duke or some other royal mucketymuck dying suddenly and mysteriously for the most part everyone considered them to be foolish tales to scare young children to bed well the work to build the bridge was progressing at an acceptable pace i was glad that the bridge would be completed in time for the fall harvest merchants and supplies would be able to travel to market and i would have finished my bridge and would be accepted as a master stonemason however as time progressed necessary building materials food and wages were not arriving in a timely manner the work slowed to a crawl and finally stopped altogether the craftsmen and laborers left the encampment daily in search of food or left to find work elsewhere finally construction on the stone bridge ceased i was forced to make a decision i had to choose either to stop the construction altogether or to use other materials to complete the bridge the decision was really simple i chose to construct a wooden deck across the stone bridges falsework this would allow foraging parties to expand out to the other side of the river to bring back supplies to what was left of the building parties their families and other camp followers a fortnight after the first foraging parties were sent out men started wandering to the river crossing these men bore the colours of various road warden garrisons and carried the wounds of battle when we tried to ask what happened the survivors were incoherent as to what had occurred and only mumbled that the hand of death was stretching out across the land i ordered the camp fires stoked and those with the worst injuries tended to for the others broth and bread was provided as the day progressed villagers and refugees began arriving seeking passage across the vetluga the refugees all bore similar stories the bodies of the dead had risen up and now walked the land of the living i could see the look on peoples faces as they started to really grasp the situation at hand the next morning the first frosts of winter could be seen on the ground the work crews foraging parties their families camp followers and refugees were all looking for answers and directions a few warriors of those who had thrown off the fugue of the horrors that they had seen and endured urged me to immediately destroy the bridge and run away the refugees pleaded to leave the bridge standing so that their loved ones could cross the riverand flee the encroaching nightmare what was i supposed to do i knew that the bridge would be a vital crossing point for any refugees but i also knew it would be a beacon for the advancing scourge as it could also cross the vetluga well i simply had no choice i was not going to condemn those survivors who made it to the crossing but i was not going to leave a passable bridge to be used for the dead to walk across either it really became a simple choice those leaving would pack lightly and head out as soon as possible those willing to stay behind were ordered to gather up bundles of wood as quickly as possible which would then would be attached to the falseworks and coated in pitch this would make the bundles and falseworks highly flammable and quick to burn once the bridge had been fired on the opposite bank i ordered gabions to be assembled and to be placed to form a wall in front of the gabion wall i had a ditch dug to slow any advances on the simple wall and bridge since we didnt know how long we had we worked at a frantic pace i was so tired but i made sure that teams worked in shifts to preserve their strength when i was sure that all the tasks were completed i finally allowed myself to get some sleep i do remember that when i laid down in my bedroll i was asleep as my face hit the pillow after what may have been a few hours i awoke screaming and yelling staggering from my tent i noticed that sun was just rising i was surprised to see in the flesh that the rumours of the undead were true i watched in horror as refugees were being dragged down as they panicked and scrambled to cross the bridge i remember donning a buff coat grabbing a simple shield and a worn sword from my tent and running to the bridge to help reinforce the defenders i had never used a sword at that time all my experience had been hefting various axes used to cut trees and lumber or mallets and mauls for stone working while i didnt have the finesse of a trained warrior my strokes were solid and devastating when they connected time seemed to slow as the fight continued and more and more joined the slaughter the red haze of killing was broken when i smelled smoke at first i didnt realize where it was coming from eventually though i was able to step back from the fight and had the chance to look around i was shocked to see the bridge had been fired without my order i realized that we had few choices we could burn to death trying to cross the bridge if we did not run now stand our ground and face the undead or leap into the freezing current of the vetluga and hope we did not drown there was only one choice i ordered a retreat from the bridgehead as planned the flames quickly engulfed the falseworks i was told later that when i had leaped clear of the flames there was a brief golden aura surrounding me that the flames licked over while i was able to cross to safety before the last of the wood frameworks collapsed and the bridge crumbled into the vetluga some men made the same leap as i others could not and instead choose to jump into the river in a desperate hope that they could swim to safety i lumbered away from the flaming bridgeworks covered in soot and the foul effluent my heart was finally realizing what my mind told meall was lost i discovered a young man barely out of boyhood standing near a brazier ordering soldiers to kill any person swimming across the river i could not believe that i was hearing orders being given to kill the survivors clambering out of the water i asked what he was doing and the man calmly informed me that he had fired the bridge and was ordering the killing of all those wallowing in the river these men were either cowards failing in their duty or were the enemy in either case the gods would know their own and claim their souls in the afterlife i must have stared like a simpleton and could only stammer out what the man simply stated that as a baronet of the kingdom it was by his lordly decree that all present would stand and fight for the kingdom of aldoria those who refused to fight no matter what the situation were to be executed as cowardly traitors rage anger and disgust crept up from my gut slowly sweeping over me like a wave i dont what happened but something finally burst through what little selfcontrol i had left and i let out a pure bestial roar of anger i did not stop when i stove his head ini hacked into his lifeless corpse and rended it into bloody chunks when the light of reason returned to me i knew that what few defenders were left would not and could not stand and fight we grabbed what supplies we could and ran for our lives while i was utterly disgusted with this example of the nobility i did have the presence of mind to take the fools signet ring coin purse and a few other items that supported any claims that this arrogant bastard had been a baronet having experienced other problem nobles and seen the corruption of the feudal system it was time to forge a new path the survivors and i ran for three days only stopping long enough to eat biltong and hardtack towards the garrison at drakensberg at that point the survivors just needed a direction and a glimmer of hope it was another two days away but between a lack of supplies and the cold we could not last much longer than four or five days unfortunately at that point two days from drakensberg we started seeing smoke rising in the direction of our goal then we started coming across refugees from the garrison they said that they were overwhelmed in the middle of the night as the dead had no fear of the dark they just shuffled out of the darkness and took the gatehouse to the city a sergeant of the garrison with hollow eyes looked to me and asked my lord what shall we do now i had not the heart to correct him but i could not deceive these people here were one hundred and fifty or more souls needing direction i looked around and asked are you willing to fight to survive are you all willing to do the things that it will take to survive if so we will fight for 18 months we fought destroying parts of the horde other times losing friends and loved ones we came to understand two things the horde was becoming larger and harder for us to fight the second was that nobility were cowering behind high walls and expecting others to fight for them yes there were knights and lords that fought and died to protect others but all we saw and heard was that they were cowards more and more we heard rumours of lands that were free of the undead so we as a group decided that we were done fighting a losing battle and we marched to walvis bay by this time our group numbered forty the port was busy with activity men loading cogs caravels longships and a multitude of other vessels taking advantage of the dead baronets signet ring i was able to find a captain and crew that would sail to mardrun with forty passengers supplies and cargo in return he received 382 silver coins a promissory note drawn on the good baronets estate and an offer of exclusive shipping rights for three years with the baronet and his factors in mardrun so that is my story anything else cub or are your fingers twitching to

skills first aid blacksmithing and field repairs my early life or what i can remember of it was influenced heavily by the vandregonian military my father worked as a smith for them keeping their swords sharp and their hammers heavy my mother was a triage nurse gentle as they come always there to save the lives she could and to comfort the ones she could not as a young girl i would listen with astonishment to the men and women who would come through my fathers forge telling their tales of honor and glory on the battlefield my father insisted that if i wanted to be in the smithy and distracting his customers i could at least learn how to swing a hammer i started watching him work though i was still too young to be much good at anything still the kindling had been lit i must have been just seven years old when i knew something was wrong both of my parents were trying not to act weird as though the happiness on their faces was just a mask soon i found out why news had reached them that the unit they both worked closely with was going to be dispatched soon near to the front lines and my parents alongside them i was too young to come with and without relatives nearby to look after me my parents sought an alternative about a week before they departed my father repaired the shield of a man named sir theobald jarnson he was as tall as a tree and just as broad his shoulders were heavy with age but his pride kept them up a graying beard hinted at his true age though the fire in his eyes and spring in his step would have you convinced he was a young man his stories enthralled me from the first time i met him his voice booming and enthusiastic he and my dad talked for a while looking back at me frequently they both looked sad they were talking about me finally sir theobald stood up and came over to me kneeling to meet my gaze he asked me if i wanted to come with him not as a squire of course he already had one of those i was to take what my parents had showed me of field repairs both of equipment and of flesh and use them to keep him and his squire uthrid as healthy as i could i couldnt believe my ears i was going to get to travel with a knight stories from soldiers are great and all but the knights were a cut above chivalrous and noble with glimmering armor and swords as sharp as they come they were more than warriors they were heroes we set off soon after that day and i promised my parents that i would learn everything that i could and that i would make them proud i practiced fixing sir theobalds armor when he would let me but it was mostly repairing uthrids chain i would also pick up any tricks i could from local healers about how to clean and dress wounds though i could never quite grasp the more intricate delicate work i could keep a man from dying from his wounds but actually fixing them was beyond my skill then there was the combat gods how i loved watching those two spar uthrid was getting older and stronger probably fourteen years by now compared to my nine he was quick and tenacious but it was clear that sir theobalds patience and experience were more than a match for the young man still they could spar for what seemed like hours and i could watch them for just as long the next year we heard about the fall of aldoria and uthrid grew nervous his parents lived close to the aldorian border and he feared for their safety after a few days of pestering sir theobald and a disgraceful number of puppy eyes from me our mentor agreed to go check on his squires family when we got to the village we were moments too late undead shambled throughout the square uthrid drew his sword and rushed in connecting quickly with the remaining town guards and fighting by their side afraid of losing his squire sir theobald followed shortly behind him cursing at him for his recklessness the whole way i kept pace with sir theobald believing that by his side was the safest place to be he had given me a practice mace for the rare instances when i would be allowed to spar with uthrid though it was little more than a club still it was my weapon and i told myself i would use if for great deeds when we got closer to the melee swirling around the village i felt a cold hand on my arm pulling me away from sir theobald i screamed he turned lowering his shoulder the man who had become like a surrogate father to me barreled into the husk that had grabbed me wrenching my arm free from its grasp and falling to the ground beside it the fight turned deadly in a hurry and sir theobald managed to drag a furious uthrid away from his hometown we had survived but only barely sir theobald urged us towards the coast paying a small fortune to secure our places on a ship away from faedrun he lookedunwell though i was scared to say something and anger him i was already ashamed that i was unable to defend myself and that he had to come to my rescue eventually i worked up the courage to ask him if he was injured at all and that i could try to patch him back up if he was reluctantly he removed his gambeson to expose his tunic stained with blood along his left arm i gently rolled up his sleeve and gasped at the wound a large chunk of flesh had been bitten out of his forearm and blood and pus coagulated in a putrid slime oozing from within he must have sustained it during his fight with the zombie that tried to take me this was my fault i insisted on coming with him but couldnt defend myself and now he had come down with a serious infection and fever i tried to recall everything my mother had taught me about treating illnesses but nothing worked some days he was worse than others but he and i both realized soon that if he was lucky he would only lose his arm he was not lucky uthrid ended up saving me from myself he was the one to take charge after sir theobald passed trying to convince me that crying about what had happened wouldnt bring sir theobald back nor would it keep it from happening to anyone else we were still young and now we were alone in the new world but at least we had each other i would work odd jobs trying to make ends meet while uthrid looked for work more suited to his skills he worked as a bodyguard mostly convincing clients of his worth despite his age i was always there to clean up his mistakes whether they were dents in his armor or wounds on his body we continued to grow up together earning our keep during the civil war and taking a break in the months that followed during this break uthrid began to encourage me to spar with him and i reluctantly obliged i focused mostly on my shield work and at the risk of sounding vain i got pretty good im not keen on the idea of hurting people so using a weapon is still somewhat foreign to me but ive learned the hard way that if i want to save those that i love i cant just wait around for them to come back uthrid brought me word of a new initiative recently called the shield of mardrun it sounds ambitious so its right up his alley ill be coming along too someone has to make sure he comes homeplayed by kevin novy name elijah cole gender male age 27 race human hair brown eyes green occupation

the undead we didnt know what to make of them they would not be brought down by any normal means and the more they advanced the more dead that would lie in their wake this is a sad story the story of my beginning the cole family were a simple lot that lived on the outskirts of a small vandregon city when i was a boy my father would take me out into the woods to hunt he trained me on how to use a bow and the importance of using traps to catch our game when we had caught a good haul we would head back to the cottage where my mother would skin the animals and bring them into the city to sell the pelts growing up in vandregon society was difficult for me my skills with the bow would often put my path before a recruiter but i was never interested in that sort of life i loved the woods and the freedom it would provide i had no other siblings so i had to do most the work around the house which was no problem for me since i valued all my parents teachings i was very content with life up until my father came face to face with a penitent though my fathers skills with a bow were great he was crippled from his right shoulder all the way down his leg this is the point in which i changed from a learning young boy to a hunter with a responsibility to feed and protect the family the last time i saw my family was when i was 15 i was hunting in the nearby forest when i heard the groaning the sun had just set and a storm was rolling in the first drops of rain had just reached my forehead when i could see the shape of a shadowy figure staggering in the distance at first i thought it was a lost townsfolk whom had gotten injured by an animal the closer it came the louder it got with its unnatural sounds and slow crunching movements my instincts told me that this was no normal man as it came into the clearing i could see its face i to this day can not get the sight of the mans rotting flesh hanging from his bones out of my mind i panicked and took a shot which was clean through the jugular before i could even come to the realization that i had just killed someone the thing simply kept coming i took off at full speed when the rain came down hard i reached my cottage within a few hours and my only thoughts were on saving my family i took off into the house to find it empty however the back door was wide open i reached it just in time for a flash of lightning to come down what i saw was my worst nightmare my mother and father were lying in the garden surrounded by those creatures i could only just make them out but it was clear they were dead then the creatures turned on me so then my legs kicked in and i was moving i couldnt tell where i was going but i just kept going i still dont know why i didnt die that day i found myself at the coast after several encounters with the undead still in shock and disbelief thats were i learned the magnitude of the situation the undead had taken my country and that vandregon was barely holding out with no reason to stay and no will to fight i fled the country on the next ship out never looking back i arrived in a place called new hope and i couldnt even recall how long the journey had been was it days weeks months maybe even years it didnt matter anymore did it my life would never be the same i tried to live with people in town and start up new roots within the city but after three years the longing for the forest became to great i left the city to live in the nearby woods were i built my own cabin and started my life anew once again for two years my life somewhat returned to what it used to be i hunted i skinned and i even set up a small stall to sell my skins in the city it was a bright winter day when i saw her she was a beautiful young woman who needed to purchase something warmer for the season maybe it was the long red hair or maybe it was the emerald green eyes but i fell for her she was also interested in me so within a few weeks we had gotten to know each other very well within the year we were married for the first time in my new life i was happy we lived in my cabin with peace and tranquility it was 5 years later that we had a son he was now my world and i cherished every day that we had together soon my mind turned to thoughts of how it would be to train my son much like my father had taught me when he turned 2 years old we were overjoyed when he took his first steps and i knew that i had found my purpose in life it was by my wifes side and with my son of course this is not a happy story i was waiting for my wife to return from selling pelts in the city i can still see my wife walking down our dirt road smiling at me with a armful of flowers she had randomly picked or bought i never got the chance to find out when i saw the arrow extend out of my wifes chest my mind went blank she stood there for a moment and then collapsed on the ground it wasnt long before i was took a arrow to the right shoulder and my arm went completely limp i felt no pain i felt nothing as i looked down at the arrow the mordok was coming out from behind its cover and started to notch another arrow i fell back into the house and i looked down to see my son standing there it was only a for a second that we stood there when i finally acted i grabbed him and ran as fast as i could i fled into the woods but they followed four in total i knew i couldnt outrun them so i set my son down and drew my sword the closest mordok must not have expected me to do this cause my blade ran straight through his chest but it was a short lived victory cause the other 3 came in right behind him and with several blows i stumbled to the ground i dont quite know what happened next but once again my legs must have kicked in cause i came to in a small cave with a man standing over me he asked me my name and all i could say was where is my son the ulven in the corner of the cave told me he saw a group of mordok flee the area with a small human child he told me his name is tobias and the man that just brought me back from the brink is puckerman i noticed they were both wearing green and looked to be wearing a matching uniform in some sense tobias must have seen the questions on my face because he next told me i was in the presence of the rangers a group of woodsman and scouts whom have banded together for the sake of honoring tobias father i told them i was in their debt and that i would join them as long as they would some how or someday help me recover my son they agreed but the chance of his survival was low that didnt matter to me i had all the hope i needed i will find my son one day

she is the real prize for the other criminals in order to keep the money flowing into the pockets she gets into the rich homes as a maid and sets up the crime i wouldnt be surprised if she is actually in charge of this group plus did the lady send her off with a recommendation for other employment blimey drex your mind is sharp im not sure if lady awen did give a recommendation to the maid we can go see her before dinner and you can ask her what you need to know shall we ha after you sir waylen so what does this maid look old young i asked she has the face that still looks young but she was approaching her 30th summer her height was about to my chin about five ft six inches she did turn heads with her long curly red hair and steely gaze of hazel she also had a nasty scar on her left hand as waylen was describing this mastermind i listened intently as he continued with the description i began to get a nasty chill and my steps became slower when he described the scar on her hand i stopped as i felt my stomach drop no it cant be her could it i thought to myself i must have looked shocked and staring off into the distance for waylen stopped ten steps ahead of me turned and asked me you okay drex i focused on waylens facewaylen did this maid have a demeanor of someone with noble birth arrogance if you will and did she have a way of capturing an audience as if the people were under a spell waylen flinched at the sound of my voice i must have sounded angry and i was i took a deep breath to control my building fury and waited for an answer with a slight tremble in waylens voice he answered  now that you mentioned it she did act like she was better than everyone else but she didnt have that behavior with the awen family she seemed nice in their presence as far as spell casting we didnt see any channeling of mana but when she was talking to a crowd they did seemed enthralled with her words do you know this woman drex fuck it was her after all these years she finally surfaced must have run out of money i must make sure it was her and talk to lady awen i reached from my former life as lord drexel helmsworth and i brought forward a commanding voice and directed it at walyenwaylen take me to lady awen immediately he saluted and for a moment wondered why he did that he asked with a perplex look drex whats going on why do we need to the hurry i began striding forward closing the gap and moving past waylen not waiting for him to catch up he caught up with me and matched my speed i explained my thoughts to him speed is necessary if i want to catch up to her she has a three day head start if she is who i think she is multiple people are endangered including their families i wouldnt doubt her partners will not see any of their profits when theyre done for she will not stop until she has quite the sum of money to tie her over for years like she did before twelve years agowaylen paled at the last statement he immediately moved a step ahead to lead me toward lady awens home lady awen confirmed my suspicions she described the person i knew to exact detail she did give the maid a recommendation to a rival merchant of her previous husbands business at new aldoria i shared my thoughts to lady awen about her previous maid she paled but didnt look surprised i think she knew something was wrong but she couldnt prove anything she sent the maid to a rival instead of a friend smart woman we left after an hour of questioning as i was walking out the door lady awen told me to do my best and that my reward will be waiting for me when i returned i asked how do you know i will succeed she responded the look in your eyes tells me you would stop at nothing to catch this monster for i can see she has done terrible things to you as well sir i wish you a safe journey waylen and i walked back toward the inn i took the bounty poster off the board and asked him to change it to add the woman he took it back towards his building while i got some supplies for the journey he returned an hour later with two copies one for the board and one for me i was grateful and bought him a few drinks before i left as i was walking out he put his hand on my shoulder and asked who is this woman to you drex you make it sound like she is a devil in disguise what happened i looked at him and thought about telling him but decided against it i did not want to

sojourner family double often moved around as a kid traveling in the army with his parents and being exposed to new people places ideologies and cultures he even participated in a few battles with the undead but often in support fashion that childhood with his moms passion for helping others and his fathers love for solving puzzles made for a unique background in his current occupation even though

arriving on mardrun with little fanfare they became familiar with wyrn neowyrd a merchant who ran several successful stores seeing how his son oryn was occasionally targeted by bandits who tried to extort him wyrn hired ceria and kyvik to watch over him and gave them jobs running one of his stores double would helpout and learn some of the trade and play with oryn for the most part things went

that threw him against a wall they were nearest he was knocked out for the second time that day oryn neowyrd soon discovered what had happened after seeing the remains of his family store though bandits had previously threatened the neowyrd shop and the family it was oryns connections with his father and the mysterious informationgathering group agnosco that actually resulted in the fatal fire two burned bodies were discovered in the wreckage of the shop but there was no way of knowing whether the bodies were of the attackers or doubles parents with few other options and a thirst for

young when i joined younger than most of the other children in the keep growing up in the shadow of the lions i hoped to emulate them and someday join them though i was always smaller than my colleagues as a child i worked hard and took any task or chore offered to me hoping that they would make me bigger and stronger though i had to work harder to match the other boys physically i was able to surpass many of them mentally devoting what time i had left to learning a scribe worked to teach me the high aldorian language so i could help her translate the tomes and spread the word of the path when i was sixteen i joined the lay militia eager to prove myself to the officers and lions overseeing my unit a few months after training i was sent as part of an escort for a number of griffons to meet with baron richards in newhope to discuss his investments into starkhaven we were given leave to explore the colony during the meeting and i found myself in a small park i saw a young girl likely not much older than ten she looked upset with three boys younger than me but still far larger than her who seemed to be mocking her relentlessly i strode past the three boys and crouched down next to the girl ignoring the boys completely hey are you alright did they hurt you the girl shook her head thats good whats your name rossignol but no one can say it right so i just go by rose well rossignol its a pleasure to meet you my name is dom its short for dominic but i dont really like that so i just go by dom i was stopped suddenly by a hand grabbing my shoulder the bullies were upset that i had ignored them and wanted my attention all they got was a finger raised telling them to wait see rossignol do you know why these brutes are picking on you because theyre mean and im small its because theyre scared they know that someday soon someone bigger or stronger or smarter or just better than them is going to come along and when that happens they wont have power over anyone else ever again theyre cowards i felt a hand on my shoulder again one moment rose i stood and turned to face the boy who was grabbing me thanks for waiting now what ca i was sent reeling by a fist in my jaw the other two caught me and kept me from moving as the first went to work on my ribs cowards huh he spat at me through gritted teeth ill show you whos a coward it seemed like hours before they finally let me go though really it was probably only a minute or two bruises on my face chest and stomach had already begun to form and all i wanted was to lay there i saw rossignol staring at me almost inspecting me from a distance and i willed myself to my feet despite my bodys many protests dominic you look bad you should lie down what this no im fine i managed somewhat weakly sure that i wasnt convincing anybody of that claim thatll show them i had them on the run i had them right where i wanted themyeah im going to sit down now well for what its worth thank you rossignol and i parted ways after that but i made sure to keep writing to her she was a smart child smarter than most i had met but always more than a little awkward around the other kids she always got excited when she made a new friend and i was happy to see those letters though they would invariably be followed shortly thereafter by another one explaining why the former friend was stupid and no longer worthy of her time i made sure to visit her any time i was in newhope and soon she became like a younger sister to me as i worked my way through the ranks of the militia i continued to write to rose i would volunteer for any missions to newhope and try to meet up with her even just for a meal i wrote to her every week and she would always respond just as quickly my aldorian grew rusty in starkhaven with fewer people continuing to uphold and learn the language but our letters gave me some practice here and there a few other members would tease me when i got the letters but i just brushed off their comments this went on for four years writing letters and visiting when i could training and drilling during the day studying scripture at night until i was finally allowed to petition to join the lions i dove headfirst into my duty ignoring the outside world completely and emerged on the other side in the light of arnath accepted and welcomed into the ranks of the lions i was busy with my new duties now preaching training new recruits learning more about the divine magic i would need to call upon and i stopped writing i continued to preach the word of arnath since that day using my faith

joseph thunderhammer died fighting on the dock as their ship sailed away he was a well respected cleric and commander for the order when darren was born few members of the order knew that he was the son of the great warrior who had just died for them and that his mother was a syndar his mother arya darkwater who hated the majority of the order was fierce and led a mutiny against them for the poor conditions she felt her son and brethren didnt deserve to live under while the ship carrying the infant darren and his mother arrived on mardrun they were met by several lions but just before their ship was captured arya strapped a visored helm to her head to hide her ears the battle was long and hard however the mutineers were tired from the long voyage and the angry lions had fresh armor and weapons and butchered everyone except arya who told them that joseph was darrens father and in an effort to save his life gave him to the lions then she slit her own throat and threw herself overboard and let her chain mail drag her to the bottom of the harbor or so he was led to believe by an eagle that was aboard and saw the whole ordeal the lions brought darren back to starkhaven where they trained him in the ways of combat and divine magic darren was a very quiet obedient recruit while the rest of the boys in starkhaven his age would be getting into trouble and getting flogged for it darren would be quietly brooding over books and scrolls since he was old enough to pick up a book darren studied hard and read as much as he could he would spend days in the library at a time and on more than one occasion he would have to be reminded to eat only when it was time to learn to fight would he leave the library he was not as good at fighting and the other recruits would mock him for this until one night when darren and the other boys were eight the other boys decided to sneak out of the keep and go steal some cupcakes from the local market outside the walls of starkhaven this was a normal thing that they would do however they never invited darren so this night darren decided to follow them and see where they went on this very night a group of mordok had the same idea as the boys however they werent there for cup cakes and pastries darren followed the boys to the bakery where the baker had left the door unlocked darren watched from behind a barrel as the four boys snuck in and out of the shop giggling and stuffing their faces with cake but their glee soon turned to looks of terror as three fully grown mordok jumped from the roof above them and surrounded the boys darren watched in terror as the three massive axe wielding beasts closed in on the four boys who had tormented him his whole life but he couldnt sit there and do nothing in a blinding flare of holy light one of the creatures was sent reeling as darren leapt over the barrel hammer in hand and threw himself into one of the mordok and took it to the ground as the two grappled they battered each other although darren managed to prevail the four boys surrounded one of the two remaining ones and stabbed it to death with knives then ran back to the keep as darren fought the last remaining one the next morning darrens body was found barely alive amidst the three dead mordok none of the guards had seen them enter the settlement and the four recruits said nothing about the night before but they knew that they were alive because of darren the clerics were able to nurse darren back to life six years later darren thunderhammer has redoubled his devotion to become a lion of the order of

his back hed long forgotten about the dull ache in his feet from his worn boots on the hard dirt roads it had been a few days since they had seen much more than a small shanty town and hed yet to find a leatherworker or a cobbler able to make him a new pair of shoes that wouldnt have fallen apart within a week of hardship that he put his footwear through a sudden voice snapped cordyn out of his day dreaming as a man came stamping up from behind the wagon he was easily ten to fifteen years older than cordyn and was dressed in fine clothes that showed his merchant status even through the thick coat of road dust that he had accumulated in his traveling im getting so damned sick of these travel rations gods among us what i wouldnt give for a real meal the man threw a small dense nut bar into the dirt and cordyn cracked a small smile oh vistero do you ever stop complaining cordyn chided picking up the bar and tucking it into a pouch on his belt oh you arent really going to save that are you vistero asked in faux disbelief he already knew the answer and cordyn already knew his retort well you know i wouldnt have to if you paid me better and you know damn well that i pay you far more than youre worth as a sellsword cordyn you know if i didnt like you so much i would have stopped paying for your services after your first contract was up years ago vistero snapped playfully while cordyn imitated him using his hand as a puppet hey stop that youre a lousy swordsman you know that right id say im a mite better than you are vistero both men smiled for a moment before visteros face grew slightly more serious you know weve been traveling together for five years and youve never told me about how you came to be on that boat where we met now i know all about the part where i told you that you had a nice sword and you told me that it was for sale we had a lovely little misunderstanding and thats how you came into my employ but how did you end up on that ship with that sword in the first place cordyns face hardened slightly it was hard to think of what his life had been on faedrun and how everything changed so quickly he had spent most of his time in mardrun assuming his family was still alive back in the old world that maybe the undead scourge hadnt touched them somehow it became harder and harder however to ignore the chatter that vandregon and aldoria had been crushed and that faedrun as he had known it was no more still maybe it would help him to talk about it well i guess i might as well tell you i was born in a small village in vandregon outside of the capitol our village was barely a drop of ink on the map not many people passed through and those who did tended not to bother to stop now before you get ahead of yourself this isnt one of those stories where my little village was beset by marauders and i as the lone survivor picked up my fathers sword and swore vengeance upon my enemies if that were the case id hope i would be a better swordsman no while this story may be sad its nowhere near as dramatic i had a happy childhood we heard whispers about the undead plague but our little hamlet seemed to be in a world of its own away from it all my father was a farmer he grew mostly grains for breads and beers but he grew enough vegetables to help keep the village running as well my mother was a seamstress first by necessity farmers and adolescent boys tend to wear through their clothes rather quickly but later by trade when her handiwork was seen throughout the village things were good they were quiet when i was around twelve i started to spend time with the apothecary making runs into the woods for reagents and portioning them out for the apothecary to mix into salves and potions id spend my time in the forests pretending to be a sword wielding adventurer as i plucked morels and roots i would always stop by the blacksmiths shop on my way out to look at the swords in the windows i think my father took notice it wasnt for a few more years that we would even start to feel like there was really something going wrong outside of our little bubble when i was sixteen my father gave me this sword and enough money to book passage on a ship to mardrun he knew something was coming and we didnt have enough money for us all to get out i didnt want to leave i wanted to stay and be with my family but he wouldnt take no for an answer he told me that when i get to new hope if i ever needed money to sell the sword it was supposed to be a gift when i turned seventeen but he felt time was running out my parents escorted me to the docks and watched me leave and now with what weve been hearingi doubt theyre still alive back there so thats why you told me that sword was for sale vistero shook his head lightly and that does explain why youre so gods awful with it i am sorry about your parents cordyn but your father was a smart man i also sensed that something big was coming and that chances to get out were dwindling thats how i ended up on that boat with you for what its worth im glad to have you here with me even if its just because i pay you part two magic tomes and a burgeoning taste for adventure years 261264 age 2124 cordyn continued to travel with vistero for the next few years while other caravan guards came and went over the years cordyn was always there he did manage to pick up a little more sword skills by training with the others he always had a hard time finding a good cobbler on the road and vistero never really got used to the taste of travel rations so when the two ended up in decent sized towns they always made sure to make the most of it sometime in the summer of 263 cordyn came across a book during a brief stopover in new hope between outings the book contained introductory lessons into arcane teachings and he quickly stowed it away for further reading the tome opened up cordyns eyes to a world of possibilities outside of his current line of work he poured through it anytime the caravan stopped for the night silently reading to himself he even developed a type of walkingmeditation that he would practice while vistero slept in the back of a cart while the book didnt delve into the realworld applications of mana weaving it opened cordyns eyes to the everpresent mana stream that surrounded him and he practiced during most of his free time to learn to tap into it the first time cordyn tapped into the mana stream he was so excited and overwhelmed that he immediately lost contact and gave himself a slight case of backlash he was more careful and more reserved in the future but he quickly came up on a road block in his studies he was to the point where the book could no longer help him he could tap into the mana stream but he had no idea how to do anything with that knowledge he needed a teacher and as much as he enjoyed his time with vistero he needed an adventure theres a whole world out there vistero im getting tired of walking the same roads again and again i want to go out and find my place i want to learn magic cordyn explained to his old friend its nothing against you im very grateful for everything youve done for me its justwell its just  its just that your twentyfour cordyn i completely understand you dont have to explain it to me ive known you for seven years now im just surprised its taken you this long to get itchy feet vistero smiled knowingly you know i was your age once boy i remember what it was like to want to find my place in the world im just lucky i found it so young cordyn felt his relief wash over himself he had been trying to find a way to tell vistero that he was interested in leaving the caravan for weeks tell you what you stick it out with me until you find a good start to your adventure we travel through plenty of towns now that youre open im sure it wont take long to find what youre looking for thanks vistero for everything _ cordyn didnt stay much longer with vistero within a few months he bumped into a syndar woman who shared his thirst for adventure and lucky for cordyn she happened to be an arcane mage she agreed to travel with him and try to teach him about magic as long as she could accompany him on his adventures he may have embellished a bit when she asked him if he was good with his sword   played by chris raab name connor darkwing gender male age 23 race human hair

thoughts in this journal i wish i could tell you truthfully that i was part of some grand prophecy or a pivotal part in the ending of the plague on my beloved faedrun or maybe even bringing the end to the civil war these ulven have become caught up in but this is not the time or place for fiction i am simply a man trying to do the best he can to survive i was born in the northwestern part of vandregon in a town known as greenridge where my father was a carpenter my mother worked as a cook for the local noble i forget his name now we lived simply but comfortably directly on the edge of the nobles estate my mother worked long hours to allow me to attend lessons on the estate i learned to read to write firstaid and basic mathematics as well as swordplay and archery while this was the basis for my current skills my father taught me resourcefulness which in retrospect has proven more useful than anything we never really worried much about the undead until we heard of a caravan that was attacked on the road leading to the town my father joined a few other townsfolk to look for survivors they returned a few hours later and with only half of their original number one thing i will never forget in all my days is the look on my normally stoic fathers face it was as white as paper and his lips were locked in a tight grimace though his eyes betrayed a fear i had never seen before he said almost nothing but immediately began packing our belongings into our wagon he wouldnt tell us more until we were several miles to the south explaining that he had seen the undead and that they were headed towards greenridge they may have even arrived by now we continued south to the capitol city where my parents looked to book us passage on a ship to the colonies they found room for two on a ship leaving the next day and my mother and sister set off for mardrun i have not seen or heard of them since my father and i lived in the capitol city for a year or two before i decided to join the vandregon army at the age of 16 only a few months before the capitol city fell i left the city with a company of soldiers to hold back a penitent force cutting a swath of destruction to the north after a few days of travel we came across the penitent force which numbered more than we had anticipated we soon found ourselves surrounded we would have been killed to the last man hand it not been for a timely rescue by a company of vandregon rangers who had been tailing the penitent what advantage the penitent had in numbers the rangers dissolved with tactics and swiftness after seeing the effectiveness of the rangers i decided to join them and did so with the blessings of my commanding officer as a ranger we made countless excursions into penitent and undead controlled territory delivering key blows to support the bulk of the vandregon forces no matter what we did though the horde pressed towards us and every few weeks we had to move our camp eventually we took refuge in an abandoned keep near the border of aldoria we continued to attempt rescues and plan strikes on penitent and undead forces but we saw more towns and villages fall than we rescued one day on an expedition into aldoria we came across a scholar and his students that were running from a penitent force after rescuing them they told us of a relic hidden in the now toppled maykar dominion that would prove to be a great weapon in the war against the dead hurrying back to the keep it was quickly decided that a group of us would go to retrieve this blade and take it to mardrun if only to keep it out the hands of the enemy it was a long hard journey we had to evade several penitent and undead forces and exterminate near as many the few surviving vandregon soldiers accompanied us as well as the scholars so that our force numbered nearly forty we acquired the relic and headed toward the coast to secure passage but were tailed by a large force of penitent we raced to the coast and arrived to find no ships seaworthy and only one that was repairable we quickly set to work repairing that ship and were nearly done when the penitent showed up the soldiers and a few of the rangers broke off to hold the penitent off while we finished the boat we cast off just as the line broke and the penitent killed the last of those still on land we numbered only 15 as we cast off for mardrun stopping where we could along the coast for supplies before truly setting out to sea it was a long grueling journey especially for one not acquainted to sea travel as happy as we were to see land that changed as soon as we set foot on the coast we were set upon by humanoidthingsim not sure exactly who or what even now that ive had the chance to rethink the whole ordeal the scholar a student another ranger and i escaped into the wilderness while my brothers in arms held off our assailants i can only assume they fell to our attackers as a small band of the things followed us after the battle we managed to evade them long enough to make it to the edge of a vast swamp we hurried into it as our pursuers gave chase miles in something happened that caused them to abandon the hunt and retreat i never knew what exactly it was we hid in that swamp so long that i lost track of time one night we were set upon by monstrous creatures im told are called mordok four of them came out of nowhere killing the student in a heartbeat between the other the three of us we were able to slay our attackers but not before they dealt fatal blows to my companions i didnt sleep that night and built a small cairn in the morning for the three of them grabbing the relic a small golden bauble from the scholar and picking up the extra sword they had i wandered the wastes for weeks always keeping out of sight of the ulven as well as the mordok after that time i came upon a familiar enemy zombies came out of the woods having fought them before i slew them but not before one bit me on the leg the rest is a haze

of flight blood and death as we fled to mardrun my father was a minor officer in the aldorian military as well as a cleric and he took his men and their families out of the conflict naturally this included me as well i remember little of the voyage except that it was hard and long but my father taught me things all the way which eased the passage he taught me of our faith and its kindness and magical knowledge he taught me magic of the divine and how to fight everything that i started with i learned from him i grew up in crows landing all the while learning and training with my father he drilled into my head all the knowledge of our church so that its vast history could live on after he passed away i learned about everything the world military tactics and the magic of faith when i grew old enough i joined the militia to help defend our home as was my duty throughout my life my father and my officers taught me to always admire and respect the chain of command recently aradeal and his companions left crows landing and disappeaared we sent out scouts and tried to find them but they had vanished victims of bandits the mordok or possibly trying to live a different life in one of the larger colonies the settlement fell apart after they left us my father and the other officers trying to rally the villagers to survive the winter when the rangers arrived they gave us a reason to rally and carry on the officers quickly placed them in command of the settlement and then set an example to the villagers by following their orders although they were new and did not have experience with our settlementthey were extremely skilled at what they did and saved us from destruction on several occasions this chain of command established quickly and followed in our time of need allowed us to reorganize crows landing and keep us from succumbing to the winter cold and starvation i suppose then that its no surprise that i ended up joining them my goal will always be peace but

among ulven but nothing else relationships thrand stormjarl  fritha stormjarl are packmates and friends rumors traitor to her kind some humans bio  background history her history is fuzzy at best in her early years she was born in the small fishing village called ravencry on faedrun where her parents raised her in a normal almost carefree fashion for the first 6 years before her 6the birthday there was an evacuation order and the village including her family fled to the ships to escape the undead blight heading their way when they arrived the remnants of the village went to start over on the coast of clan nightrivers territory this seemed bright at first but when they were still in tents as building were yet to be finished raiders attacked it was the dead of the night when screams and bright light disturbed her family she was told to stay put but peeked out to see what was happening the camp was burning she turned and ran back into her tent burrowing under blankets as she screamed in fear this was a bad idea and the fire hopped from tent to tent eventually hers caught on fire she ran from the heat into the chaos of the camp looking for her parents what she found scarred her for life as they were very clearly dead but with a childs ignorance she tried to wake them this was another mistake as a raider picked her up by the back of her night dress and threw her into a burning pile of debris the fire spread to her quickly and she scrambled out and ran to the only water she knew throwing herself to the oceans mercy she passed out from pain fright and shock in to freezing water and she drifted down the coast like a corpse when she woke she found herself tangled in seaweed and debris she shivered and struggled to shore once there she wandered aimlessly looking for someone to save her gaia must have shown her mercy as she managed to find berries and small foods to sustain her for several days a week after her village burned she had collapsed on the ground from utter exhaustion and hunger her whimpering cries hardly audible a hunting party of ulven were nearby though and by the grace of gaia one male heard her bjarke stormjarl heard something that was not like that of an animal and left his party to find it he came upon a small form huddled in the dirt weeping seeing the burns tattered clothing and soot streaks on the child he remembered the colum of smoke in the distance from a week prior he took off his cloak and bundled cenarae up holding her close and he and his party returned to their village bjarke stormjarl took the child home to his mate rada stormjarl and since she was a healer she tended to the young human as best they could a long discussion was had about her fate and they decided to raise her alongside their two sons they notified their jarl once it was clear cenarae would survive the next several years seemed to fly and the young human integrated into the family as if they had always been as she neared her 10th year she began taking an interest in the adoptive parents work her father a blacksmith for the village and her mother one of the healers she spent much of her time between the two professions rather than our play fighting with her brothers as the violence they reenacted frightened her it was on a hunting trip not long after when they were all in for a surprise bjarke cenarae and her two brothers nadir  einar had gone out when einar went bolting off after something a yell soon followed full of pain and fear without hesitation cenarae threw her bow at her other brother and ran after her errant sibling what she found was bad he had somehow managed not only to fall but to pierce himself through the gut on a broken tree limb sticking out of the snow something seemed the wash over the young human as she pulled her brother free and tore open his tunic she packed the wound and pressed but he had already lost so much blood she prayed to mother gaia and the great wolf to heal him so he may fight for their honor one day to everyone surprise they responded and einars wound eased to a far more minor one after this revelation cenarae found out news that would have broken some this was not her birth family she was not an ulven who was just taking forever to grow their fangs but that she was in fact human she was forced to remember and understand her fear of violence and fire but she took it with stride gaia has blessed me with a pack who loves me and the chance to honor her ways regardless was her response as she came to understand she left her home and went to visit a priestess of gaia to learn what she could despite not being an ulven and there for a daughter if gaia here she stayed for some time earning her sax in the process as she became a true woman of the pack as she began her 15th year she assisted where permitted with the negotiations with human colonists to aid her clan later when civil war broke out despite her fears she volunteered to the front lines at assist in helping the wounded there she met her friends thrand  fritha two more ulven from stormjarl she had never before come across during the following time she formed a bond of friendship but focused majority of her time on her work since she is not a fighter she did the most she could to aid where she could be it healing for working as a blacksmith now with the war over she works where she can

revenge for his parents death and this is where his story truly begins we shall see how it unfolds from herename sergeant caius vallenar age 33 race human hair dark brown eyes hazel occupation former vandregon lieutenant  present new hope sergeant blacksmith  bartender known skills blacksmithing  professional soldier birthplace kingdom of vandregon year 232   caius vallenar hails from a minor citystate housed in the kingdom of vandregon his father who was born a mere commoner dedicated his entire life to the service and protection of a local lord in exchange for his service he was rewarded with the official bearings of knighthood and used his noble status to provide for himself and his son while caius had the build and untapped skill for combat his true passion and calling came from the smelting and folding of steel it surprised all around him when his natural talent for the craft surfaced early on his father glowed with pride at caius skill refused to push him towards the life of rank and nobility and was eager to learn blacksmithing along with his son misfortune would not look kindly upon the young smith however a large group of cutthroats and bandits invaded their hometown looting and pillaging anything they could as the town guard was caught entirely by surprise initial resistance was scattered and disorganized at best upon hearing the screams of his neighbors caius instinctively picked up his smiths hammer and a nearlyfinished blade and ran to their aid with no hesitation they discovered him kneeling with a great wound to his right shoulder without making a sound upon closer inspection it seemed he was surrounded by two of the brigands both were dead his right hand still holding fast to the forge hammers grip after some much needed rest and training to restore his shoulder to full strength his father recognizing his true potential as a fighter immediately inquired his opinion of becoming a soldier and protecting those in need as caius was already fascinated with the weapons and tools of martial combat his decision was firm within months his combat prowess instilled great respect from his peers and set him apart from other members of the military despite his young age caius took training to the utmost importance in addition to honing his skill as a smith his aspiration to forge the finest of armor and weapons for himself and those around him that they may provide the finest protection during their time of need at the age of twentyone caius was wed to the love of his life silvetta the two were described as amongst the most honorable and devoted a couple seen throughout the land and they bore two children in only a few years time caius now with a fatherly conviction continued his life in the military and soared through the ranks while his wife took care of educating their children and continuing her role as a talented leatherworker little is known of caius life between the years of 255 to 260 save his arrival to mardrun on one of the few ships successfully completing the voyage from faedrun in the year 261 upon landing he immediately setup his small forge to accommodate the incredibly high demand for a local skilled smith with the addition of bartending in a local tavern throughout the week caius was able to quickly and efficiently establish himself on the new continent while none would dare speak ill of his work the locals who know him best are aware of one hard fact the smith came to mardrun alone caius seldom speaks of his previous life though no one would dare fault him people are known to block out the most traumatic and horrific events they have endured those who maintain relations with him have tried to appeal to his past any attempt has been met with silence followed by a cold hard stare he maintains a calm collected demeanor with a hint of ice to his personality and the local populace respects his trade and his moderately wellknown status throughout the citystate of new hope while none can say for certain rumors and theories circulate aplenty caius family was killed or lost during the fall and he shoulders the blame alone for failing to protect what mattered most for failing to possess the strength to make a difference despite his prestigious ranking inside the vandregon military he requested to be discharged upon arriving to mardrun relinquishing the titles and influence he had earned from years upon years of service over time caius opportunities improved as he was offered membership in the vandregon trade guild his duties mending armor and tending to weapons for the volunteers of vandregon individuals who kept the colors alive in the new continent his dutybound soul was somewhat at ease for he was able to supply the vandregon units with muchneeded equipment and the soldiers frequently spoke to him or petitioned him for advice while he repaired their armor and weapons known for his excellent service caius accepted a different bartending situation at a tavern in baroness catherines district of new hope though taking care of those whove had a bit much to drink would always be in his duties years went by soldiers came and went stories circulated amongst the soldiers and then to caius ears the colors of vandregon were still at the forefront of battles their leader a knight by the name of sir william commanded great respect from his men however it was not to last the oncecompelling stories heard at the tavern eventually turned to stories of worry and dread from the locals stationed at the nearby barracks vandregon was dying the last embodiment of order and solidarity was strung out low on supplies and its people beginning to starve dismissing such tales at first caius would settle the locals retelling with vigor and pride the stories of prowess he had heard about the vandregon forces on the continent the stories of sir william leading the way of lighting the everdarkening path for his brothers and sisters in arms the travelers and locals always left reassured perhaps not from the stories themselves or even the manner in which they were told something about the look in caius eyes inspired them it made them believe as time continued to pass so too did the tales of worry this weighed heavily on the smiths mind for as the rain heaped down upon the roof of the forge one night it was simply mirroring the arm of the smith blow after blow raining down upon the cherryred steel caius mind was restless and the forge was the only place he could collect his thoughts he worked faster taking half the time he normally used to heat and pound the steel into its final shape the hammer soared through the air resounding with a plethora of ringing throughout the structure faster and faster he forged until finally he made his mistake with one final strike of the hammer the blade itself broke in two shards of metal scattering across the floor of the smithy looking down at his work he examined the broken half of steel he wasnt angry he was empty staring into the distance his mind could think of nothing but vandregon picking up the broken piece of metal he held both halves of the blade in each hand it was at this moment the zeal returned to him  his brows furrowed and his eyes were set ablaze placing the metal pieces next to each other he heated them in the forge and began his task for this next blade would be his own for too long had he carried the burden of his familys fate he abandoned his pride and his post in vandregon he had become the one brand of individual he despised above all others a coward as the night went on each hammer blow to the blazing orange steel further solidified this newfound purpose caius renewed a vow to himself alone he would reenlist with vandregon he would assist in their struggles protect them from harm and regain his lost titles this would be how he honored his family if they were alive he would work to find them if they were dead he would become a man a father and a husband they would be proud of filled again with conviction and purpose caius ran out in the middle of the night to reenlist upon his arrival at the vandregon headquarters caius was astounded by what lay before him the survivors of the battles were packing up the offices and structures of the vandregon headquarters the rumors were true in their entirety and worse than previously imagined the people were rioting all of the supplies were gone sir william of vandregon vanished without a trace the overwhelming stress and high expectations of his performance had finally bore their way to his mind without his guidance and presence the soldiers lost faith and began leaving the ranks of vandregon in order to find work elsewhere vandregon and the entirety of its influence on the continent of mardrun was dissolved caius stormed back into the smithy picked up his hammer and cleanly threw it across the room into a wooden pillar the scraps of wood splintering across the floor of the workshop the fire burned deep within him but now it had changed a fiery vengeance against one who betrayed his people how could the one man he could look up to in these dark times the one whose stories turned fear on its heels in the hearts and minds of the people how could he turn his back on his own men caius gazed across the room blankly staring into the smooth stone wall despite trying desperately to push it from his minds reach the thought finally settled upon him  he himself was no different his own menhis own battalion of soldiers he had abandoned them the honor devotion loyalty and integrity he once stood for meant nothing because of his cowardice kneeling down and firmly grasping the hammer his will was finally tempered fueled now by a reformed sense of purpose and a fury against his previous self caius left the vandregon headquarters and set his path upon the military barracks of new hope knowing his previous training and rank would never transfer he refuted the doubt from his mind he would rise in the ranks and prove to his family himself and to the citizens of mardrun a truly noble cause was still worth believing in caius enlisted as a soldier in the new hope army and thus began volunteering for duties and additional training whenever the opportunity presented itself tackling every challenge or obstacle presented to him he would become a leader to the people of mardrun and shine his light for others in the dark times aheadplayed by ryan jopp character name brother ventaris gender male class cleric age presumably 35 race human hair short brown hair with a beard eyes brown occupation lion of arnath cleric of the order of arnath known skills heavy armored combat laborer skills birthplace unknown appearance in combat he wears the heavy plate red tabard and tower shield of the lions of arnath out of combat he is usually seen wearing a simple monks robe and red tabard notable traits none that are noteworthy relationships strong ties to the order of arnath rumors none bio  background history i never knew my parents were they rich nobles who cast me away because of a political agenda perhaps a bastard son who would spoil a bloodline and instead of drowning me in a creek they instead turned me in or perhaps an orphan found on the streets handed over to give me a place that wouldnt eventually lead to theft and crime perhaps it was a combination of all three regardless my life truly began when i was handed over to the order of arnath the war had been raging for decades the penitent and undead relentlessly pressing on the kingdoms of man and syndar alike the order needed fresh troops to keep up their campaign and fight back it was a glorious cause but everything is flawed in some way i believe i was born in roughly the year 230 nobody really knows but i was part of the youth recruits to the order train do chores listen to the clerics every day over and over again it was much more boring than you would think a highly organized and militaristic religious order gripped in the midst of a nearly half a century long war would be people came and went important people and hushed discussions seem to follow the maykar turned and followed them would the followers of arnath do the same at the time i had no idea what they meant now i do and those accusations offend me for years i served in the layorder youth groups until it was finally time to take the tests to become a member of the order i had learned the scriptures i had done the initial battle testing i was good too a few of the other kids learned not to mess with me that i was quick to bust out a tooth and pummel someone lions are taught to wield fury as a weapon and apparently i was good at it i had decided i was going to be the best lion and eventually lead a chapter and then even serve as hand one day my youthful arrogance was a detriment but the fact that i did what was needed to be done to advance meant that it fed my ego as well it was time for my testing and i had my sights set on becoming a lion of arnath righteous with fury unstoppable in battle our armor turning away the wicked and our zeal burning back the tide of heresy i believed in it i lived and breathed in it i wanted and had to have it but unfortunately i did not possess the willpower to have it class after class i was recycled back in my martial skills were ready but i did not possess the divine talents each season the youth around me seemed to get smaller and smaller my fellow youth cadets coming in training gaining their divine aptitude and moving on to begin training as a lion for some reason i was unable to tap into the powers of the divine and to begin the steps of the lion training you must become an ordained cleric of the order of arnath and possess his magic i was angry i was hurt i lashed out and screamed at the world and wretched myself to sleep wondering about my purpose and every other angstslike thing that young people do when faced with looking truly inwards at themselves i asked arnath time and time again what he wanted me to do i asked him to come and save me to grant my salvation and lift my fears to come and rescue me arnath is selective in his hearing for my prayers were never answered as time wore on i stopped testing for training to become a lion i was allowed to help the order scholars and do other tasks that took me away from the youth program it was apparently not my place news reached us that a continent had been found a place they called mardrun the war was not going well and even some of the order fortresses had been lost or nobody had heard from them in quite some time it seemed like every year the future looked more bleak for two years i served as a priestnot an ordained cleric but just a holy follower of arnath i learned the scripture i truly learned it not just memorized it to pass the youth trials i held sermons for others and talked of arnaths great deeds i helped people i did what i could with what i had sometimes that was combat for i never abandoned my training and kept my skills sharp but i never joined the layorder militia because i felt that once i began that path i would never return to test as a lion news arrived that the maykar dominion the great holy traitors to the kingdoms of man had finally been destroyed two decades of warfare and their oasis fortress of a capital had finally been defeated the startling details of the final stages of the war of the massacre of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians alike that were murdered for their beliefs it was enough to wretch the stomach and it took me many years to truly understand why it was then that a large callout began a fortress monastery was being built on the new continent of mardrun the conflict with the wolfpeople was over and refugees were being sent to build a colony and survive the order had been preparing to send battle barges across the sea loaded with supplies to begin a great plan to build a presence on the new land soon after the maykar dominions fall the undead menace had begun to besiege aldoria reports of the inevitable fall of the kingdom were talked about all over it was hard to hold onto the world as i knew it when an inevitable ending seemed near i began to lose my way a bit i questioned things and felt my belief slipping i had thought about signing up to go to the new continent they will need laborers and priests there to help with daily activities one of the battle barges was leaving to go along the coast and eventually go far east to the new continent do i stay do i leave what do i do that night i prayed for arnath to guide me to tell me what to do i had truly relinquished myself to the inevitability of fate and that i was unable to change my own course that it was up to arnaths plan for us all to take us where we must go i prayed the hardest i had ever prayed in my life for what my fate should be and he answered the message was clear there was no misunderstanding it no way to misinterpret it it simply said three words forge your own and when the core of my being reverberated with the deafening roar of these whispered words in my mind my hands began to glow in silver light i wept with joy and now i fully understood i was ready in the morning i packed my things and volunteered for the voyage to mardrun after a long and dangerous voyage at sea where i contemplated my faith held sermons to still fears and understand the wisdom of arnath and his ways of teachings we finally arrived the moment i landed on the shores of mardrun in 253 i signed the papers necessary to prepare for another test to enter the lions of arnath this time i knew that things were going to be differentbrother orn ree order of arnaths fist 62 years old orphaned  joined the order  received training with the lions and eagles traveled to mardrun on the battle barges married with 2 children  1 male 1 female both in the order 1 lion 1 eagle when do we start to question our purpose in life i was content in the lions until recently the last 5 years have been hard on arnaths fist we were always being sent to scout and smash the enemy never questioning why just going out to slaughter anything not human and even some humans were eliminated along the way we stand for right and goodness yet kill anyone or anything we are told to we have killed by the tens of thousands and have died by the thousands  why we were taught anything not human had to go  they were our enemy but these last 13 years have shown me differently in the great civil war with the ulven we fought against them and yet we fought with them when we were left at the pass where were our human allies where was our food weapons our relief many of the order died in that pass for what as we traveled home to our starving people where was our help to feed them not humans but ulven gave us supplies should we kill them because they are just ulven no not anymore we have suffered greatly from this war many dead battle barges destroyed the keep unfinished and the order in decay no no no we have to decide what is right and good for us we need to survive we need to choose our battles wisely not just be used by others to hammer the enemy our enemy is the one that helped us to survive through the winter some of our leadership is trying to change and i will do everything i can to make that happen no more killing everything not human they have shown us compassion can we do anything less
