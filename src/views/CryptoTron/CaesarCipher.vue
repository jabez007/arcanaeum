        <p>
          The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers.
          It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.
          For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
          The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
        </p>
        <p>
          More complex encryption schemes such as the Vigen√®re cipher employ the Caesar cipher as one element of the encryption process.
          The widely known
          <a @click="shift=13">ROT13</a> 'encryption' is simply a Caesar cipher with an offset of 13.
          The Caesar cipher offers essentially no communication security as it can be easily broken even by hand.
