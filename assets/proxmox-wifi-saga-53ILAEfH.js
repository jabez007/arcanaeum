<p><em>Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love USB tethering</em></p>
<p>Picture this: You’ve just installed Proxmox VE on an old laptop, ready to dive into virtualization glory.
You boot up, eager to start pulling container images and VM ISOs.
Then reality hits—your “server” has no Ethernet port, and Proxmox looks at Wi-Fi like it’s some alien technology from the future.</p>
<p>Welcome to my weekend project that turned into a networking archaeology expedition.</p>
<h2>The Catch-22 That Started It All</h2>
<p>Here’s the beautiful irony: Proxmox doesn’t support Wi-Fi out of the box, but you need internet access to install the Wi-Fi tools.
It’s like needing experience to get a job, but needing a job to get experience.
Classic.</p>
<p>So there I was, staring at a perfectly good laptop running Proxmox, completely cut off from the internet.
Time to get creative.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1: The Great USB Tethering Adventure</h2>
<p><em>“Surely this will be simple,”</em> I thought, plugging in my Android phone and enabling USB tethering. <em>“How hard could it be?”</em></p>
<p>Narrator: <em>It was not simple.</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">ip <span class="hljs-built_in">link</span> show
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing.
Not even a hint of a new network interface.
No <code>usb0</code>, no <code>enx...</code>, just the same lonely interfaces mocking me.</p>
<h3>The Cable Conspiracy</h3>
<p>After some head-scratching and checking <code>dmesg</code> for clues:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">dmesg | <span class="hljs-built_in">tail</span> -n 30
<span class="hljs-comment"># *Absolute silence*</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The problem wasn’t drivers, firmware, or some arcane kernel configuration.
It was something far more embarrassing: <strong>the USB cable was charge-only</strong>.
No data transfer capability whatsoever.</p>
<p>🤦‍♂️ <em>One cable swap later…</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">dmesg | <span class="hljs-built_in">tail</span> -n 30
<span class="hljs-comment"># Suddenly: New USB device detected!</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># New interface: enxabcdef123456</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>:
Not all USB cables are created equal.
Your phone charger might betray you when you need it most.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Getting Online (Finally!)</h3>
<p>With a proper cable, tethering became straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># Bring up the interface</span>
ip <span class="hljs-built_in">link</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> enxabcdef123456 up

<span class="hljs-comment"># Get an IP address</span>
dhclient enxabcdef123456

<span class="hljs-comment"># Test connectivity</span>
ping -c 3 google.com
</code></pre>
<p>Success!
My phone was now serving as a gateway to the internet.
Time to install those Wi-Fi tools.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2: The Wi-Fi Configuration Dance</h2>
<p>Armed with internet access via tethering, I could finally install the tools I needed:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">apt install wireless-tools wpasupplicant
</code></pre>
<p>Then came the configuration files. First, the Wi-Fi credentials in <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-toml"><span class="hljs-attr">ctrl_interface</span>=/run/wpa_supplicant
<span class="hljs-attr">update_config</span>=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">country</span>=US

<span class="hljs-attr">network</span>={
    <span class="hljs-attr">ssid</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;SSIDNAME&quot;</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">psk</span>=your_encrypted_password_hash_here
    <span class="hljs-attr">proto</span>=WPA RSN
    <span class="hljs-attr">key_mgmt</span>=WPA-PSK
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Security note</strong>: Generate that <code>psk</code> hash properly with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">wpa_passphrase SSIDNAME PASSWORD &gt;&gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I updated <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>:</p>
<pre><code>auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto wlo1
iface wlo1 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
    address 192.168.132.200/24
    bridge-ports none
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
</code></pre>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Mystery of the Missing Internet</h2>
<p>After restarting networking services, Wi-Fi connected but something was still wrong:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">systemctl restart networking
<span class="hljs-comment"># Wi-Fi interface doesn&#x27;t get an IP automatically</span>

dhclient wlo1  <span class="hljs-comment"># Manual DHCP request works</span>
ping google.com
<span class="hljs-comment"># → &quot;Temporary failure in name resolution&quot;</span>

ping 8.8.8.8
<span class="hljs-comment"># → Works perfectly</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The classic DNS problem! But here’s where it got interesting…</p>
<h3>The DNS Detective Work</h3>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cat</span> /etc/resolv.conf
<span class="hljs-comment"># nameserver 192.168.132.1</span>

dig @192.168.132.1 google.com
<span class="hljs-comment"># → Times out completely</span>
</code></pre>
<p>My router was advertising itself as a DNS server but wasn’t actually responding to DNS queries from this machine.
Other devices on the network worked fine. What was different about this Proxmox box?</p>
<h2>Chapter 4: The Subnet Collision</h2>
<p>Here’s where networking fundamentals came back to bite me.
I had unknowingly created a routing nightmare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi interface (<code>wlo1</code>)</strong>: Getting DHCP on <code>192.168.132.0/24</code></li>
<li><strong>Proxmox bridge (<code>vmbr0</code>)</strong>: Static IP also on <code>192.168.132.0/24</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Two interfaces, same subnet, routing chaos ensued.</p>
<p>Even though <code>vmbr0</code> had no physical uplink, its presence was confusing the routing table.
DNS queries were probably going out with the wrong source IP and getting dropped by the router.</p>
<h3>The Eureka Moment</h3>
<p>The fix was elegantly simple—move <code>vmbr0</code> to its own isolated subnet:</p>
<pre><code>auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
    address 192.168.123.100/24  # Different subnet entirely
    bridge-ports none
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
</code></pre>
<p>After a reboot, everything clicked into place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi got a clean DHCP lease</li>
<li>Default routing worked properly</li>
<li>DNS resolved without any hacks</li>
<li><code>apt update</code> worked flawlessly</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This journey taught me several valuable lessons:</p>
<p>🔌 <strong>Cable Reality Check</strong>: That random USB cable in your drawer might just be for charging. Data cables and charge cables look identical but behave very differently.</p>
<p>🌐 <strong>Subnet Separation</strong>: Don’t put multiple interfaces on the same subnet unless they’re actually bridged together. Routing gets confused fast.</p>
<p>🔍 <strong>DNS Debugging</strong>: When <code>ping 8.8.8.8</code> works but <code>ping google.com</code> fails, you’re dealing with DNS resolution, not connectivity.</p>
<p>📱 <strong>USB Tethering</strong>: It’s an excellent emergency fallback for getting isolated systems online, but double-check your hardware compatibility.</p>
<p>🧠 <strong>Routing Ambiguity</strong>: Even when IP addresses look correct, subtle routing conflicts can break services in non-obvious ways.</p>
<h2>The Victory Lap</h2>
<p>With Wi-Fi finally working, my old laptop transformed from an expensive paperweight into a proper Proxmox server.
No more phone tethering, no more DNS overrides, just clean, working network connectivity.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most frustrating problems have the simplest solutions—but only after you’ve explored every complicated possibility first.
If you’re setting up Proxmox on Wi-Fi-only hardware, hopefully this guide saves you from the same networking rabbit holes I fell into.</p>
<p>Now, time to actually start using this thing for what it was meant for: running virtual machines and containers.
The real fun begins!</p>
